"1","Forecasting the consequences of climate-driven shifts in human behavior on cetaceans","Alter, S. E.; Simmonds, M. P.; Brandon, J. R.","While climate change is expected to affect cetaceans primarily via loss of habitat and changes in prey availability, additional consequences may result from climate-driven shifts in human behaviors and economic activities. For example, increases in shipping, oil and gas exploration and fishing due to the loss of Arctic sea ice are highly likely to exacerbate acoustic disturbance, ship strikes, bycatch and prey depletion for Arctic cetaceans. In the tropics, climate change may result in increased hunting pressure on near-shore dolphins and whales off Asia, Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere as the availability of other marine resources diminishes. This study explores the range of potential consequences to cetaceans worldwide from predicted climate-driven shifts in human behavior, and evaluates the risks to particular species given their geographic ranges and habitat preferences. While concern about impacts of climate change on cetaceans has largely focused on polar species, the analysis presented here suggests tropical coastal and riverine cetaceans such as the lrawaddy dolphin, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, and finless porpoise are particularly vulnerable to those aspects of climate change that are mediated by changes in human behavior. Policy recommendations include the following: (1) information about cetacean populations should be incorporated into national, regional and international climate adaptation decisions wherever possible (for example, via GEF-sponsored adaptation initiatives); and (2) human-mediated impacts of climate change should be included in cetacean conservation and management plans, such as the management procedures of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), where possible. Because human responses to climate change are likely to evolve rapidly over the coming years and decades, it is important that local, regional and international cetacean conservation and management plans include regular reviews to allow them to adapt to new information.

"2","Perennial Systems (Temperate Fruit Trees and Grapes)","Andresen, J. A.; Baule, W. J.; Hatfield, J. L.; Sivakumar, M. V. K.; Prueger, J. H.","Perennial fruit crops are produced across a wide variety of climates and geographical settings worldwide. As specialty crops with relatively high input costs, farmgate value, and multiple-year production cycles, they require high levels of management and are susceptible to a large number of weather- and climate-related impacts. This review considers eight economically important perennial crops grown that share similar environmental limitations: tree fruits apple, pear, sour (tart) cherry, sweet cherry, peach, apricot, plum, and vining fruit grapes. While the global area on which these crops is produced is limited with just under 2 million hectares or about 2.8% of total global non-forage related cropland (FAO, 2018), their economic impact is significant. For example, in the United States during 2016 these crops collectively had a net farmgate value of just under $11.9 billion on a production area of only 661,000 ha (NASS USDA, 2017). In contrast to some agricultural crops, crop quality is typically of greater importance in the production cycle than crop yield and quantity. Major weather and climate-related constraints include temperature fluctuations and extremes, especially spring freezes, insufficient or untimely rainfall, hail, and pressure from a variety of weather-dependent plant disease and insect pests. Recent climatic changes have resulted in a longer and warmer growing season in many production areas, with some regions becoming too warm to meet cool season chilling requirements. Impacts from projected future changes in climate include a continuation of recent trends, a potential poleward shift for some crop production areas, and the introduction of new and exotic pest species.",2019,"","AGROCLIMATOLOGY: LINKING AGRICULTURE TO CLIMATE","60","","425-452","WOS:000667934200017","10.2134/agronmonogr60.2016.001610.2134/agronmonogr60","","#468","Andresen 2019","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-31 01:18:01)(Select): adding sociocultural and biotic tags.

"4","Climate Change Cross-Border Migration and the Biden Administration: What the Future Holds?","Bhardwaj, C.","This article comments on the """"Report on the Impact of Climate Change Migration, 2021"""" in the context of cross-border migration induced by climate change and existing domestic laws to protect immigrants fleeing climate change and environmental disasters in their country of origin. The Report will guide future domestic mechanisms to protect immigrants fleeing climate change under Executive Order (EO) 14013. The Biden Administration, through its EO 14013 in January 2021, had directed the National Security Advisor to prepare a report on the intersection of climate change and migration. The Report was released in October 2021 and consisted of cross-cutting themes that can guide future action plans built on principles of justice and equity, gender equality, and inclusion of marginalized communities. There is compelling evidence that disparate treatment exists in the United States on the basis of nationality, origin, race, and so on against migrants fleeing environmental disasters and climate change in their countries of origin. For example, historically, the United States has protected people disproportionately affected by disasters and ecological crises under domestic laws such as the Azorean Refugees Act 1958. However, the Azorean Refugees Act only covered the Europeans, and ever since, no domestic law has not been extended to protect people fleeing environmental disasters from non-European countries. Today, U.S. domestic laws fail to protect people of all nationalities fleeing environmental difficulties. The existing U.S. Immigration Law sets forth Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian visas that may be applied to protect such cross-border migrants. However, these laws have not been applied equally to vulnerable global communities.",2023,"AUG 1","ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE","16","4","254-260","WOS:000874210000001","10.1089/env.2021.0117","","#1161","Bhardwaj 2023","","Human movement; Perspective paper",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

N.","Natural, geographical barriers have historically limited the spread of communicable diseases. This is no longer the case in today's interconnected world, paired with its unprecedented environmental and climate change, emphasising the intersection of evolutionary biology, epidemiology and geography (i.e. biogeography). A total of 14 articles of the special issue entitled """"Geography and health: role of human translocation and access to care"""" document enhanced disease transmission of diseases, such as malaria, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, COVID-19 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona 2) and Oropouche fever in spite of spatiotemporal surveillance. High-resolution satellite images can be used to understand spatial distributions of transmission risks and disease spread and to highlight the major avenue increasing the incidence and geographic range of zoonoses represented by spill-over transmission of coronaviruses from bats to pigs or civets. Climate change and globalization have increased the spread and establishment of invasive mosquitoes in non-tropical areas leading to emerging outbreaks of infections warranting improved physical, chemical and biological vector control strategies. The translocation of pathogens and their vectors is closely connected with human mobility, migration and the global transport of goods. Other contributing factors are deforestation with urbanization encroaching into wildlife zones. The destruction of natural ecosystems, coupled with low income and socioeconomic status, increase transmission probability of neglected tropical and zoonotic diseases. The articles in this special issue document emerging or re-emerging diseases and surveillance of fever symptoms. Health equity is intricately connected to accessibility to health care and the targeting of healthcare resources, necessitating a spatial approach. Public health comprises successful disease management integrating spatial surveillance systems, including access to sanitation facilities.

K.; Parajuli, J.; Priya, R.; Reddy, Ebub; Seigerman, C. K.; Mukherji, A.","Due to its potential geo-political and environmental implications, climate migration is an increasing concern to the international community. However, while there is considerable attention devoted to migration in response to sea-level rise, there is a limited understanding of human mobility due to freshwater and inland hydroclimatic changes. Hence, the aim of this paper is to examine the existing evidence on migration as an adaptation strategy due to freshwater and inland hydroclimatic changes. A meta-review of papers published between 2014 and 2019 yielded 67 publications, the majority of which focus on a handful of countries in the Global South. Droughts, floods, extreme heat, and changes in seasonal precipitation patterns were singled out as the most common hazards triggering migration. Importantly, most of the papers discuss mobility as part of a portfolio of responses. Motivations to migrate at the household level range from survival to searching for better economic opportunities. The outcomes of migration are mixed - spanning from higher incomes to difficulties in finding employment after moving and struggles with a higher cost of living. While remittances can be beneficial, migration does not always have a positive outcome for those who are left behind. Furthermore, this meta-review shows that migration, even when desired, is not an option for some of the most vulnerable households. These multifaceted results suggest that, while climate mobility is certainly happening due to freshwater and inland hydroclimatic changes, studies reviewing it are limited and substantial gaps remain in terms of geographical coverage, implementation assessments, and outcomes evaluation. We argue that these gaps need to be filled to inform climate and migration policies that increasingly need to be intertwined rather than shaped in isolation from each other.",2023,"AUG","Climatic Change","176","8","","WOS:001029146100001","10.1007/s10584-023-03573-6","","#1844","Caretta 2023","","Human movement",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"7","The current research landscape of disaster-induced migration: A systematic review and bibliometric analysis","Chumky, T.; Basu, M.; Onitsuka, K.; Hoshino, S.","Migration induced by disasters has gained attention across the globe. Several international agencies have already highlighted the extent of disaster-induced migration and called for interventions. Though these agencies present a broad perspective, either at international, national, or regional level, the status of existing empirical studies on migration induced by specific disaster events is somewhat unknown. Hence, this paper reviews the existing empirical literature on disaster-induced migration with a special emphasis on the spatio-temporal variability in migration types and patterns in response to both slow onset and rapid onset disasters. Using the Web of Science database, PRISMA framework is followed to select 43 research articles to conduct bibliometric analysis and systematic review. The review findings demonstrate a prevalence of studies on migration due to rapid onset disasters like flood, landslides and earthquakes compared to slow onset disasters like droughts. Also, migration from rural areas to urban areas are found to be the most common spatial pattern of migration irrespective of the type of disaster. The existing studies are found to concentrate on the economic drivers that induced disaster-induced migration with very less or no focus on other social or political drivers or an interplay of drivers that may lead to migration. The review demonstrates that apart from considering migration as an adaptation strategy, it is important to conduct more extensive studies on the dynamics, types and patterns, and interaction mechanism of different drivers of migration for future disaster preparedness.",2022,"MAY","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION","74","","","WOS:000790836000001","10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.102931","","#2283","Chumky 2022","Laura  Dee (2024-08-30 23:23:03)(Select): I think we will want this at least for background on climate impacts on human movement flows ; Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-16 13:38:32)(Select): A nice review of disaster-induced migration that does not include any mention of subsequent biodiversity impacts (even broadly defined);","Human movement; Transboundary unclear; save for other sections",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature","Cipollina, M.; De Benedictis, L.; Scibè, E.","This article provides a comprehensive quantitative overview of the literature on the relationship between environmental changes and human migration. It begins with a systematic approach to bibliographic research and offers a bibliometric analysis of the empirical contributions. Specifically, we map the literature and conduct systematic research using main bibliographic databases, reviews, and bibliometric analysis of all resulting papers. By constructing a citation-based network, we identify four separate clusters of papers grouped according to certain characteristics of the analysis and resulting outcomes. Finally, we apply a meta-analysis to a sample of 96 published and unpublished studies between 2003 and 2020, providing 3904 point estimates of the effect of slow-onset events and 2065 point estimates of the effect of fast-onset events. Overall, the meta-analytic average effect on migration is small for both slow- and rapid-onset events; however, it is positive and significant. Accounting for the clustering of the literature, which highlights how specific common features of the collected studies influence the magnitude of the estimated effect, reveals a significant heterogeneity among the four clusters of papers.

Temporally and spatially accurate shipping data that reveal historical and current traffic trends are vital to plan safe shipping corridors, develop infrastructure, plan and manage protected areas, and understand the potential environmental and cultural impacts of change, as well as for sovereignty and safety considerations. This study uses a recently developed geospatial database of ship traffic to provide the first synthesized overview of the spatial and temporal variability of different vessel types in Arctic Canada during the 26-year period from 1990 to 2015. This examination shows that, overall, the distance traveled by ships in Arctic Canada nearly tripled (from 364 179 km in 1990 to 918 266 km in 2015), that the largest proportion of ship traffic in the region is from general cargo vessels and government icebreakers (including research ships), and that the fastest growing vessel type by far is pleasure craft (private yachts). Spatial shifts in vessel activity over the last quarter century have favoured areas with active mine sites, as well as the southern route of the Northwest Passage.

"10","Exploring climate finance for tourism adaptation development: an overview","do Nascimento, D. V.","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the links between climate finance and tourism adaptation development. Besides increasing adaptation and mitigation efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, climate change remains a major challenge in the twenty-first century and beyond especially for tourism which is highly climate sensitive. Hence, it is necessary for tourism to adapt to survive. The aim of the study is to provide a systematic overview of the topic to offer a foundation for better understanding different ways of integrating climate finance initiatives with tourism. Design/methodology/approach - The research focused on the top-ranked, peer reviewed journals of each of the two selected research fields. To address this topic, an in-depth systematic literature review in the fields of climate change finance and tourism adaptation development was conducted. Furthermore, because it is a relatively new research topic, conference proceedings were also explored. To guarantee wide coverage of the literature, a query of the following scholarly databases was considered: Elsevier, ScienceDirect and Web of Science. Findings - Based on the analyses of the literature available on the topic, the paper highlights the main research trends and conclusions. It is argued that there is imbalance of knowledge on climate change finance as it relates to tourism. To date, there have been relatively few published articles on this topic in the context of tourism. Based on the findings, promising areas for future research were identified, and in particular for small island communities and recommendations for future research are outlined. Research limitations/implications - The paper is limited by the scope of the literature review accessed by the researcher. The results of this review may vary according to the databases used. Originality/value - Currently, there is no extensive review of articles on climate finance and tourism adaptation. This paper aims at reviewing climate finance studies published in English language to explore knowledge gaps in tourism adaptation. Sets of themes being advanced are also highlighted.

"11","Adapting North American agriculture to climate change in review","Easterling, W. E.","The adaptability of North American agriculture to climate change is assessed through a review of current literature. A baseline of North American agriculture without climate change suggests that farming faces serious challenges in the future (e.g. declining domestic demand, loss of comparative advantage, rising environmental costs). Climate change adjustments at the farm-level and in government policy, including international trade policy, are inventoried from the literature. The adaptive potential of agriculture is demonstrated historically with situations that are analogous to climate change, including the translocation of crops across natural climate gradients, the rapid introduction of new crops such as soybeans in the US and canola in Canada, and resource substitutions prompted by changes in prices of production inputs. A wide selection of modeling studies is reviewed which, in net, suggests several agronomic and economic adaptation strategies that are available to agriculture. Agronomic strategies include changes in crop varieties and species, timing of operations, and land management including irrigation. Economic strategies include investment in new technologies, infrastructure and labor, and shifts in international trade. Overall, such agronomic strategies were found to offset either partially or completely the loss of productivity caused by climate change. Economic adaptations were found to render the agricultural costs of climate change small by comparison with the overall expansion of agricultural production. New avenues of adaptive research are recommended including the formalization of the incorporation of adaptation strategies into modeling, linkage of adaptation to the terrestrial carbon cycle, anticipation of future technologies, attention to scaling from in situ modeling to the landscape scale, expansion of data sets and the measurement and modeling of unpriced costs. The final assessment is that climate change should not pose an insurmountable obstacle to North American agriculture. The portfolio of assets needed to adapt is large in terms of land, water, energy, genetic diversity, physical intrastructure and human resources, research capacity and information systems, and political institutions and world trade-the research reviewed here gives ample evidence of the ability of agriculture to utilize such assets. In conclusion, the apparent efficiency with which North American agriculture may adapt to climate changes provides little inducement for diverting agricultural adaptation resources to efforts to slow or halt the climate changes.",1996,"JUN","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","80","1","1-53","WOS:A1996UV51900002","10.1016/0168-1923(95)02315-1","","#3323","Easterling 1996","","Human movement; Original study; Potentially relevant",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

"13","Arctic Tourism Development with Regard to Legal Regulations and Environmental Protection","Gawor, L.; Dolnicki, P.","Arctic tourism develops very quickly and requires both changing of legal regulations and consid-ering environmental issues. The developing branch of services (significantly tourism) has became an important sector in the shaping of the budget of numerous countries worldwide. World-wide climate changes provide new possibilities of visiting remote countries with severe climate conditions. Global warming is particularly intense in the Arctic, where mean temperatures have recently risen twice as fast as in the rest of the world. A comprehensive set of regulations was recently developed to protect the wilderness of Arctic environment from the negative impact of tourism. The purpose of the paper is to present legal and organizational regulations connected with organization of tourist trips in the Arctic, based on the example of Svalbard area, American Arctic and Russian Arctic. There are described particularly legal regulations that concern cruise operators. These issues have been described based on literature studies, analysis of legal regulations and statistical data. The time range of the study is about 20 years. Also discussed are challenges of tourism as seen in the Northwest Passage, a historical challenge for many sailors and Russian Arctic tourism development. The issues of economic benefits, environmental protection and connections between tourism and climate conditions are presented. There is also a focus on weather enabling tourism in the Arctic. It can be said that new possibilities of visiting remote places with severe climate conditions (e g. Arctic region) are opening due to global changes. It occurs mainly due to the reduced sea ice cover for longer periods of time, which facilitates tourist access and extends visitor seasons. It has been assumed that global climate change may lead to a shift of tourism demand to higher latitudes, creating additional opportunities for tourism in northern regions.",2018,"","PRACE KOMISJI GEOGRAFII PRZEMYSLU POLSKIEGO TOWARZYSTWA GEOGRAFICZNEGO-STUDIES OF THE INDUSTRIAL GEOGRAPHY COMMISSION OF THE POLISH GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY","32","2","289-298","WOS:000437710200021","10.24917/20801653.322.20","","#4146","Gawor 2018","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-22 03:35:40)(Select): Unclear whether this is exactly a review, but it's certainly not original research.

C.; Pacillo, G.; Laderach, P.; Spillane, C.","The Central American Dry Corridor (CADC) is among the most climate-vulnerable regions worldwide. Climate change, commonly referred to as a """"threat multiplier"""" of pre-existing socioeconomic issues, already undermines rural livelihoods by reducing agricultural yields and income opportunities. This paper provides a review of climate-related migration in the CADC region while identifying the specific pathways by which climate change manifests itself as a threat multiplier to migration. Different forms of human mobility (seasonal/temporal/permanent and internal/international migration) are increasingly attempted as adaptation strategies by affected households to diversify incomes and offset climate impacts. Preferred intra-regional migrant destinations tend to be less climate-vulnerable and also less violent. Notably, climate change is not isolated from socioeconomic and political migration drivers. Erosion of rural livelihoods reduces the costs of engaging in illicit coping strategies (e.g., illegal crop production) and simultaneously favours rapid urbanisation, which is linked to (forced) gang recruitment, primarily affecting the youth. These processes contribute to extraordinarily high violence levels, which are a major push factor for migration on their own, ultimately challenging state authority. Moreover, as outmigration from the region is projected to increase, the observed securitisation of borders, particularly along the USA-Mexico border and the Mexico-Guatemala border, while unfit to limit migration attempts, make migration more desperate and dangerous, allowing organised crime to step in and exploit migration as an economic undertaking. Thus, for the CADC, the depoliticised and simplistic narrative of migration serving as adaptation must be questioned.

H.","As with all social processes, human migration is a dynamic process that requires regular theoretical reflection. This article offers such reflection as related to the role of the natural environment in contemporary migration research and theory. A growing body of evidence suggests that environmental contexts, as shifting social and ecological realities, are consequential to migration theory. In this article, we review some of this evidence, providing migration research examples that integrate environmental context and are applicable to core migration theories, including neoclassical economic and migration systems perspectives, the """"push-pull"""" framework, and the new economics of labor migration. We suggest that neglecting consideration of the natural environment may yield misspecified migration models that attribute migration too heavily to social and economic factors, particularly in the context of contemporary climate change. On the other hand, we suggest, failure to consider migration theory in climate scenarios may lead to simplistic projections and understandings, as in the case of """"climate refugees.""""

The nature of interventions for displaced populations itself influences food security in hosting areas, and recent debates over refugee assistance have indicated some ways in which existing practice can be counterproductive. The recognition that environmental change can be associated with forced migration has made an important contribution to debates over who should be the legitimate beneficiaries of international relief, but the term 'environmental refugee' is misleading conceptually and is legally and institutionally unfounded.

Although effective antifouling paints incorporating organotins have considerably reduced fouling biomass these paints have a limited period of effectiveness, which may be less than the ships' inter-docking period, depending on sea temperature and abrasion. Vessels immersed over several years can allow fouling communities to develop and spread beyond their native distribution. This process of establishment is not fully understood. This review proposes that short rapid turnaround of vessels with mature attached biota can result in synchronized spawnings and production of sufficient zygotes to form a founder population. Spawning may be induced by changes in temperature or salinity on entry into a port, according to season. The diversity of taxa. in transit on ships' hulls includes commercial molluscs, which have the potential to transmit their diseases or pests to port regions. Several factors may act in the further enhancement of exotic species establishment including changes of in-port berthing regions to more marine conditions. Ships today are generally larger, and faster, and have a high frequency of port visits thereby increasing the number of spawning opportunities, perhaps with a larger inoculum size. With trade expansion, new trading routes, political events and changes in climate, new pathways for invasion will emerge. Greater controls on industrial discharges, improved treatments of urban wastes and better management of waste runoff into rivers as well as a phasing out of organotin antifoulants will mean a reduced toxicity in port regions. This may enable a smaller inoculum to colonize by creating opportunities for establishment not present in the previous 25 years.

Our findings indicate significant variability in this relationship across different scales of farming operations, including large, medium, small, and landless farmers. We also identify several local contextual factors-such as access to credit, social structures, social fractionalization, conflicts, and migrant networks- that intricately influence this association.

Among its consequences, its impact on migration is the object of increasing attention from both policy-makers and researchers. Yet, knowledge in this field remains limited and fragmented. This article therefore provides an overview of the climate change migration nexus: on the basis of available empirical findings, it investigates the key issues at stake, including the social and political context in which the topic emerged; States' policy responses and the views of different institutional actors; critical perspectives on the actual relationship between the environment and (forced) migration; the concepts and notions most adequate to address this relationship; gender and human rights implications; as well as international law and policy orientations. Two major interconnected arguments arise. The first regards the weight of environmental and climatic factors in migration and their relationship to other push or pull factors, whether of a social, political, or economic nature. The second is about the political framework in which such migration flows should take place and the manner in which to treat the people who move in connection with environmental factors.

Thus, this paper reviews 75 articles to evaluate the different impacts of Arctic shipping on the region's environment. The research results show that the impact of current Arctic shipping activities is extensive, and it can identify three major impacts: impact on water bodies, impact of air emissions and impact on animal survival. In this context, to mitigate the growing negative impact of shipping activities on the fragile Arctic environment, it is essential to adopt technical and operational solutions for ships and formulate new or stricter standards and rules for Arctic shipping activities. At the same time, existing research has gaps in four areas: Arctic environmental and ecological baseline surveys, quantitative research on the direct and synergistic environmental impacts from Arctic shipping, implications of Arctic shipping activities on aboriginal health, and the Arctic shipping gas emission model based on artificial intelligence technology.

Avoidance of dangerous climate change will require sustained substantial reductions of emissions by mid-century and that net emissions decrease to zero before 2100. This paper describes, reviews and explains the place of tourism in AR5 and AR5's relevance for tourism's future, including impacts, adaptation, vulnerabilities, and mitigation. Tourism's position in AR5 has strengthened, particularly with respect to the recognition of transboundary impacts, the sector's contribution to climate change and its mitigation requirements. Major regional knowledge gaps persist. A lack of understanding of the integrated impacts of climate change and the effectiveness of adaptation strategies potentially hinders the development of resilient tourism operations and destinations. Uncertainties regarding tourist response to climate change impacts and mitigation policy impede predictions of tourism demand.

D.; Thornton, F.","The article evidences to what extent rights-based climate litigation is applied as a strategy to enhance the recognition and protection of climate-induced migrants. Adopting a deductive approach and desk review, the study, illustrates how climate-induced migration has been addressed by International Human Rights Law, with some attention also paid to the growing application of the right to a safe climate and climate justice. The study highlights the duties of both States and private actors in tackling the emerging climate crisis under the human rights agenda. Relevant responsibilities are framed in particular within the scope of rights-based litigation dealing with the topic. We present an analysis of litigation linked to climate-induced migration that was filed before distinct international, regional, and national jurisdictions and, in doing so, propose a chronology of cases-structured in three generations-of how population movements as a result of climate change have been discussed by judicial means. The first generation relates to cases that consider the issue from the perspective of protection-in both national, regional, and international jurisdictions. The second generation emerges within general climate litigation claims, involving commitments linked to the climate agenda. In addition to raising (forced) population movements as one of the expected impacts of climate change, such cases frequently call upon a rights-based approach. The third generation encompasses rights-based cases centred on climate-induced migrants per se. The strengths and limitations of rights-based litigation to respond to the topic are finally highlighted: we conclude that litigation remains a blunt but not unpromising tool to respond to climate-induced migration. Generic references to the risk of (forced) population movements largely prevail; nevertheless, strategic rights-based litigation can facilitate the visibility of climate-induced migrants to the international community, fostering the development of legal solutions in the longer term.",2024,"MAY 28","JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE","16","1","227-247","WOS:001143228900001","10.1093/jhuman/huad066","","#11007","Serraglio 2024","","Human movement; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This review examines potential drivers for increased diagnoses of canine leptospirosis in the United States and Canada, using the epidemiologic triad of agent-environment-host as a template. Leptospira spp. are classified into more than 250 serovars, but in many laboratories only 6 are routinely tested for in serologic agglutination tests of canine sera. Leptospiral infections in dogs may potentially go undetected with unemployed or currently employed diagnostic methods. Disease transmission from infected reservoir hosts usually occurs via urine-contaminated environmental sources such as water. Direct contact between infected and susceptible individuals, environmental factors such as climate changes in temperature and/or rainfall, and increasing number and urbanization of reservoir hosts may greatly increase dog exposure risks. A dog's lifestyle may influence exposure risk to leptospirosis, but vaccination based on proper identification of circulating serogroups dramatically reduces post-exposure infections.

In North America, highly visible disasters have already caused populations to relocate, but historically, larger scale migration has occurred in response to longer term climatic shifts. As relocation to destinations spanning small towns to metropolitan gateways accelerates, planning can play a central role in shaping how these places accommodate newcomers and prepare for longer term urban restructuring. To lay the groundwork for this emerging area of research and practice, we draw from adjacent areas of planning. We examine current research on immigrant integration and amenity migration, recent media coverage of climate destinations, research on shifts in physical livability, and the emerging body of work on receiving communities. Limitations to our study include a focus on recent research and confining the geographical scope to North America. Based on our review, we found that migration is only adaptation when newcomers are effectively integrated into receiving communities. This can occur through reconciling social inclusion with economic development, meeting the distinct needs of newcomers that may also exacerbate the needs of current residents, and pursuing long-term planning for deconcentration.Takeaway for practiceAs climate-related migration becomes part of adaptation practice, planners should focus on reconciling social inclusion and economic development and engaging newcomers and existing residents in participatory processes to develop physical and social resilience.",2024,"JAN 2","JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION","90","1","30-49","WOS:000982936900001","10.1080/01944363.2023.2188242","","#12023","Teicher 2024","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-22 03:55:49)(Select): includes a nice section on land use planning in communities receiving climate migrants, considering it as enough of a biodiversity link; ","Human movement",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Current IPCC assessments cannot address the local scale impacts and adaptive needs of Arctic Indigenous communities based on the global, top-down model approaches used. Inuit maintain the longest unrecorded climate history of sea ice in Canada, and to support Inuit community needs, a decolonized, Inuit knowledge-based approach was co-developed in the community of Mittimatalik, Nunavut (Canada) to create the Mittimatalik siku asijjipallianinga (sea ice climate atlas) 1997-2019. This paper presents the novel approach used to develop the atlas based on Inuit knowledge, earth observations and Canadian Ice Service (CIS) sea ice charts, and demonstrates its application. The atlas provides an adaptation tool that Mittimatalik can use to share locations of known and changing sea ice conditions to plan for safe sea ice travel. These maps can also be used to support the safety and situational awareness of territorial and national search and rescue partners, often coming from outside the region and having limited knowledge of local sea ice conditions. The atlas demonstrates the scientific merit of Inuit knowledge in environmental assessments for negotiating a proposal to extend the shipping seasons for the nearby Mary River Mine. The timing and rates of sea ice freeze-up (October-December) in Mittimatalik are highly variable. There were no significant trends to indicate that sea ice is freezing up later to support increased shipping opportunities into the fall. The atlas shows that the first 2 weeks of November are critical for landfast ice formation, and icebreaking at this time would compromise the integrity of the sea ice for safe travel, wildlife migration and reproduction into the winter months. There was evidence that sea ice break-up (May-July) and the fracturing of the nearby floe edge have been occurring earlier in the last 10 years (2010-2019). Shipping earlier into the break-up season could accelerate the break-up of an already declining sea ice travel season, that Inuit are struggling to maintain.",2021,"OCT 26","Frontiers in Climate","3","","","WOS:001021792700001","10.3389/fclim.2021.715105","","#13200","Wilson 2021","Laura  Dee (2024-08-30 23:20:53)(Select): Not a mention of biodiversity per se, but does impact NCPs and indigenous communities/boundaries . mentions species too """"This exposes Indigenous coastal communities to a higher risk of accidents, pollution, noise, invasive species, and disruptions to subsistence hunting areas, wildlife reproduction, populations, and migration routes (Huntington et al., 2015; ICC-Alaska, 2015; Meredith et al., 2019)."""" ; ","Biophysical; Human movement; IK; save for other sections",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

"33","Remediation technologies for oil-drilling activities in the Arctic: oil-spill containment and remediation in open water","Manzetti, Sergio","The Arctic Ocean is a large aquatic ecosystem stretching 14,056,000 km 2 across the Northern Hemisphere, and hosts a multitude of marine species, avian species, and the well-known polar bear in its domain. The Arctic Ocean is the most remote ocean in the world and has been inaccessible to traffic and oil-drilling activities until recent years. However, as transport, trade, and global turnover of petrol and oil products increase and climate changes reduce the glacial surface of the North Pole, the Arctic Ocean is becoming an area of interest for international shipping, offshore, and drilling activities. Nevertheless, this development requires ultimately a parallel implementation of environmental technologies for oil-drilling safety, with particular emphasis on oil-spill remediation in cold and harsh environments. In this context, this study reports on the most recent developments of open sea and coastline oil-remediation technologies for the prevention of damage to wildlife and the Arctic ecosystem as a whole. The review encompasses methods including microbial, chemical, and nanotechnological areas of oil-spill remediation, which are reported in context with the weather limitations of the Arctic wherever available.

The focus is not limited to climate change as much of the research literature tends to focus on migration and the wider concept of environmental change. The book is mainly focused on the impact of environmental/climate change on migration given the current policy interest in this issue, but it is recognized that there is a considerable body of literature on the impact of migration and refugee movements, on the environment. It also offers a selective review of key research to date on the topic of migration, the environment and climate change within the aforementioned themes. It examines the existing evidence with respect to the ways in which changes in the environment and climate change are affecting the movement of people and the types of policy responses and protection gaps which potentially exist.

The agricultural sector employed about 1.4 billion of the world's 3.4 billion workers in 2008. Even without climate change, coming years are likely to witness continuing large-scale migration out of the agricultural sector, particularly in developing countries where farm incomes are significantly lower than non-farm incomes. Climate change, specifically global warming, is likely to accelerate this pace of migration. Several economic models project that global warming will have more effects on the distribution of farm production than global farm output, with new areas becoming viable for farming as a result of higher temperatures. However, far more people are likely to be displaced by global warming than those likely to find jobs in these new farming areas. Existing policy addressing the challenges already faced by agricultural workers as they seek alternative economic opportunities is limited. The likely impact of climate change on the agricultural sector, more displacement, underscores the urgent need for policymakers and the international community to commit greater attention and resources towards developing a package of innovative policies to provide workers with alternative opportunities within the agricultural sector or to ease their out-migration from the sector.",2010,"","Climate Change and Migration Series","","","7-pp","","","","#20850","Martin 2010","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-22 03:46:01)(Select): Focused on international agricultural migration patterns, including mentions of migrants as essential to agricultural production in destination countries.

The disease seems to be underestimated, especially in countries located in the temperate climatic zone. The presented article concerns the main characteristics of leptospirosis and describes formerly known and recently observed environmental, occupational and recreational risk factors significant in the spreading and pathogenesis of the disease. The aspects of epidemiology significant in the temperate climatic zone are emphasized. The majority of cited articles present cases of the disease reported from Europe or North America. Climatic changes (warming) and extreme weather events such as floods are potential risk factors of leptospirosis. Also, some socio-economic phenomena, such as the intensive migration of people resulting in the transfer of the infections acquired in tropical countries, or worsening of economic status in the cities, increase the probability of disease. Apart from the danger connected with rodents, which are the main vectors of leptospires, occurrence of the disease in dogs and cats can generate a higher risk of infection for humans. Infections may also be acquired during various types of agricultural work and during recreational activities, such as swimming. The results of recent investigations show that ticks are also potential vectors of leptospires. The more frequent emergence of leptospirosis in countries located in the temperate climatic zone emphasize the need to verify knowledge related to the risk of its appearance, and to consider this disease during diagnostic processes.",2013,"","Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine","20","2","239-244","","","","#24345","Wasinski 2013","","Biotic; Human movement; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
"38","Water stress and human migration: a global, georeferenced review of empirical research","Wrathall, D. J.; Hoek, J. van den; Walters, A.; Devenish, A.","This report assesses and maps 184 peer-reviewed, empirical research articles selected for their focus on linkages between water stress and human migration. First and most importantly, this literature asserts that migration is universal. Migration is an extremely common social process and is normal in almost every society on earth. Moreover, migration is not a pathological response to environmental change. Environment-influenced migration is rarely (if ever) a resource threat to the regions to which people move. The literature does, however, observe that negative social outcomes can result from narratives that stigmatize migrants and/or cast migrants as a security threat - especially when these narratives are used to justify increased surveillance and monitoring of these people. A number of the reviewed articles argue for the adoption of proactive policies and programmes that seek to reduce migration. Typically, these articles identify a case for investment in sustainable agriculture and rural livelihood diversification. In water-stressed areas, experience suggests that such policies and programmes can both slow rural-urban migration and reduce the incentive for people to attempt to move across international borders out of desperation rather than out of choice. The literature reveals a strong consensus that increased water stress can cause people to decide to migrate. There also appears to be a consensus that increasing mean temperatures are correlated with, and are thought to be a cause of, increased water stress. As temperatures rise, water stress may result from less water, increases in evaporation, and increases in agricultural water demand. But the link between temperature and water stress is not unique to drought. Recent papers demonstrate that a combination of higher temperatures and rainfall extremes are correlated with increases in migration rates away from areas where these changes can be observed. This being said, the causal interaction of temperature, water stress and migration is still not clearly understood. More systematic studies are needed. In an effort to determine where further empirical research may be justified, we initially map the distribution of reviewed articles at the sub-basin level and then compare these data with expected future changes in surface temperature and precipitation. Examination of these maps suggests that linkages between water stress and migration are understudied in India, Central Asia, the Middle East, and the Central Sahel. As data transparency is low and/or insecurity makes field data collection difficult in some of these areas, the use of novel data-gathering techniques, such as crowd-sourcing, passive data collection from digital devices and remotely sensed data, is suggested as a way to speed progress.",2018,"","FAO Land and Water Discussion Paper","","11","ix-pp","","","","#24568","Wrathall 2018","","Biophysical; Human movement",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Climate Change, Migration, and Health","McMichael, Celia; Barnett, Jon; McMichael, Anthony J"," Climate change is projected to cause substantial increases in population movement in coming decades. Previous research has considered the likely causal influences and magnitude of such movements and the risks to national and international security. There has been little research on the consequences of climate-related migration and the health of people who move.In this review, we explore the role that health impacts of climate change may play in population movements and then examine the health implications of three types of movements likely to be induced by climate change: forcible displacement by climate impacts, resettlement schemes, and migration as an adaptive response.This risk assessment draws on research into the health of refugees, migrants, and people in resettlement schemes as analogs of the likely health consequences of climate-related migration. Some account is taken of the possible modulation of those health risks by climate change.Climate-change-related migration is likely to result in adverse health outcomes, both for displaced and for host populations, particularly in situations of forced migration. However, where migration and other mobility are used as adaptive strategies, health risks are likely to be minimized, and in some cases there will be health gains.Purposeful and timely policy interventions can facilitate the mobility of people, enhance well-being, and maximize social and economic development in both places of origin and places of destination.
