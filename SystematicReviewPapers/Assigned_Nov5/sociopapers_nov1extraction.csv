"1","Trade-related food policies in a more volatile climate and trade environment*","Anderson, K.","Providing affordable access to enough healthy and safe food for an ever-more-affluent and growing world population has become more challenging in the face of climate change, rising income inequality and a more uncertain global trade environment. Agriculture is expected to contribute more, but is under pressure in both high-income and developing countries to do so more sustainably and inclusively. This paper reviews the roles of food policy in this changing setting. It begins by revisiting the case for keeping food markets open to international trade, investment and technology transfer, and concludes that openness is even more important, especially for developing countries, as the climate becomes warmer and more volatile. It then summarizes trade-related food policy developments globally in the 50 years prior to the global financial crisis, and in the price-spike periods since then. The current situation is calling for more action - including from agriculture - to mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss. The scope for re-purposing food policies to better meet these demands is then assessed. It proposes some alternatives to current measures that could better achieve national societal objectives while simultaneously benefitting the rest of the world in terms of easing natural resource and environmental stresses and reducing national and global poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, and inequalities in income, wealth and health. The review concludes by noting areas where further research could facilitate such transformations in food policies.",2022,"MAY","Food Policy","109","","","WOS:000806138100005","10.1016/j.foodpol.2022.102253","","#445","Anderson 2022","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-28 08:29:02)(Select): tagging as human movement since that full section title is human movement & trade; Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-28 08:28:29)(Select): c1: yes

K.; Burkhardt, H.; Boakye-Danquah, J.; Doucet, T.; Abolina, E.","With its northern location, the exposure and vulnerability of Canada's forest ecosystems to climate change impacts are all too glaring. While there is now an extensive body of literature describing expected climate change impacts and potential responses, studies characterizing the implementation of adaptation and mitigation practices in forest management remain rare in the Canadian forest sector. Using a systematic literature review, we examined reports on forest management practices implemented in response to climate change, specifically focusing on governance and institutional arrangements that either support or limit climate change adaptation and mitigation responses. Our literature sample size of 24 documents suggests that the body of literature reporting on adaptation and mitigation practices in forest management is scarce. Governments remain the dominant actors providing funding and leading the implementation and reporting of climate change adaptation practices, primarily in response to national or international climate change commitments. Forest practices such as enhanced silviculture, assisted migration, and nature -based solutions were the most frequently reported. However, given the scarcity of literature, it is difficult to conclude the scope of climate change adaptation practice uptake in Canada. Barriers such as lack of information/data, inter -jurisdictional knowledge transfer, policy conflicts, forest tenure models, technical capacity gaps, and economic barriers to adaptation need to be overcome to strengthen climate change response in forest management. Better coordination of reporting at the provincial and national levels and improved information flows between private sector organizations and governments are needed.",2024,"MAR","Environmental Reviews","32","1","42-67","WOS:001161460100001","10.1139/er-2022-0131","","#514","Antwi 2024","Tyler McIntosh (2024-10-23 07:47:18)(Select): on transboundary information flow: """"Our results suggest that the majority (54%) of all practices

E.; Matthews, N.; Milner-Gulland, E. J.; Smith, P.; Walmsley, S.; Young, L.","Humankind faces a Triple Challenge: averting dangerous climate change, reversing biodiversity loss, and supporting the wellbeing of a growing population. Action to address each of these issues is inherently dependent on action to address the others. Local, national, and international policy goals on climate change, biological diversity, and human wellbeing have been set. Current implementation measures are insufficient to meet these goals, but the Triple Challenge can still be met if governments, corporations, and other stakeholders take a holistic perspective on management of land and waters. To inform this effort, we identify a set of priority policy responses drawn from recent international assessments that, whilst not being the only potential solutions, can form the core of such a holistic approach. We do this through an iterative process using three methodological approaches: (i) structured literature review; (ii) deliberative expert analysis; and (iii) wider consultation, before synthesizing into this paper. Context-appropriate implementation of responses will be needed to capitalize on potential policy synergies and to ensure that unavoidable trade-offs between management of land and waters for climate mitigation, biodiversity restoration, and human wellbeing outcomes are made explicit. We also set out four approaches to managing trade-offs that can promote fair and just transitions: (1) social and economic policy pivoting towards 'inclusive wealth'; (2) more integrated policymaking across the three areas; (3) 'Triple Challenge dialogues' among state and non-state actors; and (4) a new research portfolio to underpin (1), (2), and (3).Key policy insights:Multiple recent global assessments provide a strong scientific basis for action on each of the three aspects of the Triple Challenge - climate, biodiversity, and human wellbeing (with a focus on food and nutrition) - but they do not provide an integrated perspective on how to address them simultaneously.Synthesis of these assessments identifies a portfolio of five core policy responses that deliver across the Triple Challenge: (i) rapidly cutting fossil fuel use; (ii) promoting sustainable, healthy diets; (iii) increasing food productivity and cutting food loss and waste; (iv) implementing nature-based solutions at scale; and (v) strengthening governance and management of land and waters.Even with widespread implementation of that portfolio, trade-offs between climate, biodiversity, and wellbeing outcomes might be unavoidable.

L.; Aw, T. G.; Luo, L. F.; Rose, J. B.","There is a growing concern about continued impairment of aquatic ecosystems resulting from increasing population size, land use, climate change, and the feedbacks that may harm human well-being. We describe a 100 year multi-disciplinary overview of changes in Lake St. Clair, North America to identify knowledge gaps and needs to build the foundation for creating coupled human and natural system models. Our historical analysis indicates that the socioeconomic dynamics are inextricably linked to the urban dynamics of the Detroit metropolitan area. Environmental degradation and human health issues led to the adoption of relevant policies, including construction of wastewater treatment facilities by the 1960s. Climate trends during the 100-year period indicate a wetter region, which is influencing lake levels. Since the mid-1980s and 90s invasive zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugenis) have significantly altered the ecological. structure and function of the lake. Waterborne illnesses due to contaminated drinking water were once an issue but current human health risks have shifted to contaminated recreational waters and coastal pollution. Key research needs for building coupled models include geo-referencing socioeconomic and ecological data to accurately represent the processes occurring within the political and watershed boundaries; assessing ecosystem services for human well-being; and developing research hypotheses and management options regarding interactions among land use, people and the lake. Lake St. Clair has gone through extensive changes, both socioeconomically and ecologically over the last 100 years and we suggest that it serves as a useful case study for the larger Great Lakes region.

"5","PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY IN COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS - INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW","Beatley, T.","Much less attention has been paid in recent years to the threats to coastal and marine biodiversity, compared to biodiversity in more terrestrial habitats. The tremendous biodiversity at risk and the severity and magnitude of the pressures being exerted on coastal habitats suggest the need for much greater attention to be focused here by both the policy and scientific communities. The threats to coastal biodiversity are numerous and include air and water pollution; over exploitation and harvesting; the introduction of exotic species; the dramatic loss of habitat due to urbanization, agricultural expansion, and other land use changes; and the potentially serious effects of global climate change. These threats suggest the need for swift action at a number of jurisdictional and governmental levels. Major components of such an effort are identified and described. These include the need for comprehensive management approaches, the expansion of parks and protected areas, restoration and mitigation, multinational and international initiatives, and efforts to promote sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles.

Here we provide the Regional Integrated Assessment of climate change on Quebec's forests, a work that involved several research teams and focused on climate change impacts on Quebec's commercial forests and on potential adaptation solutions. Our work showed that climate change will alter several ecological processes within Quebec's forests. These changes will result in important modifications in forest landscapes. Harvest will cumulate with climate change effects to further alter future forest landscapes, which will also have consequences on wildlife habitats (including woodland caribou habitat), avian biodiversity, carbon budget, and a variety of forest landscape values for Indigenous peoples. The adaptation of the forest sector will be crucial to mitigate the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystem goods and services and improve their resilience. Moving forward, a broad range of adaptation measures, notably through reducing harvest levels, should be explored to help strike a balance among social, ecological, and economic values.

"7","Linking smallholder farmer climate change adaptation decisions to development","Burnham, M.; Ma, Z.","This paper synthesizes peer-reviewed literature on smallholders' adaptation to climate change in developing countries. The synthesis shows that multiple definitions of adaptation were used across studies, resulting in a conceptual murkiness that is a barrier to generalizing the findings to inform planned adaptation policies and projects. By using a seven-category typology to classify and compare smallholder farmer adaptations across communities, the synthesis shows that in order to reduce their vulnerability smallholder farmers have mostly taken action on environmental management and diversified their livelihoods through market exchange. Some have engaged in labour migration. Very few have pursued communal pooling, storage, or mobility as risk-reducing strategies. Despite the increasing recognition that adaptation is driven by multiple stressors, less than half of the adaptation studies included discussions of multiple stressors. The synthesis points to the need for (1) improved methodological clarity in climate change adaptation research, (2) more research on labour migration and climate change interactions, (3) more research to determine the conceptual and practical significance of communal pooling and storage as risk-reducing strategies, (4) the incorporation of the assessment of multiple stressors into climate change adaptation research and policy, and (5) more empirical research on what adaptive strategies are not adopted by smallholder farmers and why.",2016,"","Climate and Development","8","4","289-311","WOS:000380276700001","10.1080/17565529.2015.1067180","","#1676","Burnham 2016","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-20 01:56:47)(Select): Adding sociocultural tag: significant focus of the paper on shifting smallholder behaviors and decision making (i.e. adaptation) in response to climate change.

The """"luxury effect"""" posits a positive association between biodiversity and socioeconomic status in urban areas, and is thus reflective of environmental injustice, as the benefits associated with biodiversity are not equitably shared across society. We aimed to determine the generality of the luxury effect, and to identify the factors causing its variation across published studies. Location Urbanized landscapes globally. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Terrestrial animals and plants. Methods We tested the luxury effect across a sample of 337 estimates of the relationship between biodiversity measures and socioeconomic status from 96 studies via a meta-analysis, addressing three hypotheses: (a) the luxury effect is more pronounced where water availability is limited, (b) the luxury effect is more pronounced in developing than developed countries, (c) the luxury effect is stronger in exotic compared to native species. Results There was a significant overall luxury effect: there was a positive association between terrestrial biodiversity measures and socioeconomic status. The strength of the luxury effect was greater in arid areas. There was limited support for a stronger luxury effect in exotic species, but no support for any association with development status. Main conclusions Many key and emerging climate impacts are concentrated in urban areas. Therefore, the degree of environmental injustice represented by the luxury effect may be amplified in the future, especially in arid regions. The objective to increase urban biodiversity through more equitable management and provision of water resources could form part of a wider strategy for sustainable development of cities to promote environmental justice, enhancing the quality of life of urban residents across all sectors of society.

All require awareness, information, and achievable actions to contribute to moving towards healthy oceans, the base of a robust blue economy. Ocean Watch, a program run by Ocean Wise Conservation Association, was created to translate scientific understanding, combined with community and traditional knowledge, to empower local action for improved marine health. Clear improvements have been made in the Atl'ka7tsem/Txwnewu7ts/Howe Sound marine environment, which have been captured in an updated report following from the original 2017 publication. Information within the reports illustrates the connection of communities and the marine environment through articles describing seven themes, which are: (1) Species and Habitat; (2) Clean Water; (3) Sense of Place; (4) Coastal Development and Livelihoods; (5) Stewardship and Governance; (6) Oceanography and Climate Change; and (7) Seafood. Articles such as the 2017 article: """"Sea Stars: wasting disease taking its toll"""" gave background, rationale for importance, current status, current actions, and recommended actions to improve the health status (healthy, caution, critical, limited/no data). The health status for 10 of 28 reassessed articles improved largely due to actions taken by local communities, as recommended in the 2017 report. However, more work is needed, especially for areas of marine health that were not improving and to address threats from climate change.

E.; Fowler, L.; Ford, J.; Tickamyer, A.","The Arctic is experiencing a rapid temperature increase, four times faster than lower-latitude regions, disproportionately affecting rural, coastal, and Indigenous communities. These areas confront multiple urgent climate challenges. Adaptation strategies encompass out-migration, community relocation, and enhancing resilience, yet research in this critical area is notably limited, particularly for the most vulnerable communities. This paper presents a comprehensive review of environmental stressors and contextual factors influencing migration decisions in the North American Arctic. While migration is primarily driven by job opportunities, education, healthcare, cultural, and infrastructural factors, factors such as family, culture, safety, subsistence life, and community ties strongly influence residents to stay. The study reveals a lack of clear evidence for climate-driven migration at the individual/household level, but it underscores well-documented community-level relocations. Two major challenges in studying Arctic climate migration are identified: the complexity of migration and the uniqueness of Arctic climate change. Recommendations include considering migration typology, disentangling climate drivers from contextual factors, and addressing data limitations through systematic collection, integration, and creative use of traditional and nontraditional data. The paper underscores the importance of establishing partnerships with local communities to achieve a holistic understanding of factors driving migration or immobility, ensuring research outcomes are connected to addressing community challenges.

K.","Climate change's effects on water resources have been some of the first realities of ecological change in the Anthropocene, forcing climate change adaptation efforts even as the international community seeks to mitigate climate change. Water law has thus become one vehicle of climate change adaptation. Legal research into the intersections between climate change and water law in the United States must contend with the facts that: (a) climate change affects different parts of this large country differently; and (b) U.S. water law is itself a complicated subject, with each state having its own laws for surface water and groundwater and the federal government playing a significant role in interstate and international waters, in building and managing large water infrastructure, and in creating water rights for Native American tribes and other federal reservations. Within this complexity, legal research to date has tended to focus on the law governing surface water in the American West, enumerating various problems with the prior appropriation doctrine as the West grows hotter and drier and offering multiple suggestions to increase legal flexibility so that western water can be re-allocated to reflect changing social-ecological realities. These suggestions extend to new, more comprehensive, and more adaptive water governance approaches.

Participation was most commonly reported at the model generation and participant identification stages, and least commonly reported in the choice of modelling type. Participatory scores - based on the number and degree of participatory stages of a study - were higher where authors gave instrumental or transformative rationales for the use of participation, and among studies that described prioritising non-Western knowledge types.

Implementing an ecosystem approach can contribute to climate change adaptation by improving ecosystem resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, by providing planning strategies and tools to monitor and assess the impacts of climate change on fisheries, and by relying on precautionary, flexible, and adaptive approaches that account for the uncertainties, surprises, unpredictability, and dynamism of ecosystems in a changing climate. In this article, I provide an overview of some key considerations framing the mandate and capacity of regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements to implement ecosystem approaches in the context of climate change. The article first addresses the extent to which international law of the sea, and in particular the 1995 United Nations Fish Stock Agreement, endorses and implements an ecosystem approach to fisheries for the management of straddling and highly migratory stocks. It then addresses the barriers to more effective implementation of an integrated and adaptive ecosystem approach to fisheries in transboundary settings, including the decentralized and consensus-based nature of international law, stationary visions of ecosystems, and principles of certainty and stability. This analysis is then expanded to focus on specific challenges of adapting to climate-induced changes to transboundary stocks distribution and abundance. I address preparing and planning for climate change, responsive decision-making procedures, regulation of new fisheries, jurisdictional challenges, enhancing marine resilience, and revisiting allocation agreements, highlighting legal provisions and policy developments that may support or enhance the adaptive capacity of transboundary fisheries arrangements. I conclude that, despite some supportive legal provisions and practices, structural, legal, and political barriers severely hinder the pace and the scope of required governance and management responses to climate-induced changes to transboundary stocks.",2020,"DEC","Ecology and Society","25","4","","WOS:000603995100032","10.5751/ES-11988-250443","","#3464","Engler 2020","Tyler McIntosh (2024-09-03 08:50:34)(Select): global paper with very little that is specific to NAm, but suggest including given explicit discussions of a number of specific transboundary drivers & policies interacting with climate & biod

O.; Irmak, S.","Forests and forestry-related industries and ecosystem services play a critical role in the daily life of all societies, including in cultural, ecological, social, economic, and environmental aspects. Globally, there are about 4.1 billion hectares of forestland. In the United States, there are about 304 million hectares of forestland, covering about 34% of the total land area, and the forest product industry produces over USD 200 billion worth of forestry products annually. Evidence suggests these precious resources may be negatively impacted by climate change via direct and indirect processes, including wildfires, insect/pest pressure, drought, extreme storm events, increased air temperature, solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and other factors and variables that can be detrimental. All these can not only cause significant changes in the health and productivity of the forests, but can also cause the extinction, migration, and/or re-distribution of different tree species. Thus, humankind has the paramount responsibility to take policy, technologic, economic, environmental, and management decisions and actions to protect this vital resource for current and future generations, plants, and animals. This paper provides an overview of some of the important characteristics of forest environmental services, climate-environment-forest interactions with respect to forest health and productivity, climate change's impacts on forest species, and the utilization of forest biomass for high-value products.",2023,"DEC","Forests","14","12","","WOS:001130675400001","10.3390/f14122409","","#3592","Faluyi 2023","Tyler McIntosh (2024-10-23 07:58:10)(Select): """"Besides the possibility that

A.; Rice, J. S.","Drought has long posed an existential threat to society. Engineering and technological advancements have enabled the development of complex, interconnected water supply systems that buffer societies from the impacts of drought, enabling growth and prosperity. However, increasing water demand from population growth and economic development, combined with more extreme and prolonged droughts due to climate change, poses significant challenges for governments in the 21st century. Improved understanding of the cascading multisectoral impacts and adaptive responses resulting from extreme drought can aid in adaptive planning and highlight key processes in modeling drought impacts. The record drought spanning 2008 to 2015 in the Colorado Basin in the state of Texas, United States, serves as an outstanding illustration to assess multisectoral impacts and responses to severe, multi-year drought. The basin faces similar water security challenges to those across the western US, such as groundwater depletion and sustainability, resource competition between agriculture and growing urban populations, limited options for additional reservoir expansion, and the heightened risk of more severe and frequent droughts due to climate change. By analyzing rich, high-quality data sourced from nine different local, state, and federal sources, we demonstrate that characterizing regional multisector dynamics is crucial to predicting and understanding future vulnerability and possible approaches to reduce impacts to human and natural systems in the face of extreme drought conditions.

Within these types of responses, actors used a wide variety of practices such as replanting, altering species composition, and adopting or changing technology. Adaptation efforts in early planning and advanced implementation received some attention, but early implementation and expanding implementation were most reported. While connections between responses and risk reduction were discussed, there is limited evidence of risk reduction. Our review contributes to the scholarly and practical understanding of how people adapt to climate change in the context of forests.

Increasingly, however, crops and livestock are produced in isolation, particularly in farms operating at the commercial scale. It has been suggested that re-integrating crop and livestock systems at the field and farm level could help reduce the pollution associated with modern agricultural production and increase yields. Despite this potential, there has been no systematic review to assess remaining knowledge gaps in both the social and ecological dimensions of integrated crop and livestock systems (ICLS), particularly within commercial agricultural systems. Based on a multi-disciplinary workshop of international experts and additional literature review, we assess the current knowledge and remaining uncertainties about large-scale, commercial ICLS and identify the source of remaining knowledge gaps to establish priorities for future research. We find that much is understood about nutrient flows, soil quality, crop performance, and animal weight gain in commercial ICLS, but there is little knowledge about its spatial extent, animal behavior or welfare in ICLS, or the tradeoffs between biodiversity, pest and disease control, greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, and drought and heat tolerance in ICLS. There is some evidence regarding the economic outcomes in commercial ICLS and supply chain and policy barriers to adoption, but little understanding of broader social outcomes or cultural factors influencing adoption. Many of these knowledge gaps arise from a basic lack of data at both the field and system scales, which undermines both statistical analysis and modeling efforts. Future priorities for the international community of researchers investigating the tradeoffs and scalability of ICLS include: methods standardization to better facilitate international collaborations and comparisons, continued social organization for better data utilization and collaboration, meta-analyses to answer key questions from existing data, the establishment of long term experiments and surveys in key regions, a portal for citizen science, and more engagement with ICLS farmers.",2017,"JUL","Agricultural Systems","155","","136-146","WOS:000404707000013","10.1016/j.agsy.2017.05.003","","#4114","Garrett 2017","DAVID GONZALEZ (2024-08-21 12:55:56)(Select): Not specific to North America, but does highlight flows of knowledge at international level.

The capacity of communities and households to respond to these changes (i.e., their adaptive capacity) will determine the impacts of climate and co-occurring stressors. To date, empirical evidence linking theoretical measures of adaptive capacity to community and household responses remains limited. Here, we conduct a global meta-analysis examining how metrics of adaptive capacity translate to human responses to change (Adapt, React, Cope response) in 22 small-scale fishing case studies from 20 countries (n=191 responses). Using both thematic and qualitative comparative analysis, we evaluate how responses to climate, environmental, and social change were influenced by domains of adaptive capacity. Our findings show that adaptive responses at the community level only occurred in situations where the community had Access to Assets, in combination with other domains including Diversity and Flexibility, Learning and Knowledge, and Natural Capital. In contrast, Access to Assets was nonessential for adaptive responses at the household level. Adaptive households demonstrated Diversity and Flexibility when supported by strong Governance or Institutions and were often able to substitute Learning and Knowledge and Natural Capital with one another. Standardized metrics of adaptive capacity are essential to designing effective policies promoting resilience in natural resource-dependent communities and understanding how social and ecological aspects of communities interact to influence responses.

We summarize resilience assessments conducted in each system to provide a synthesis and reference by the other articles in this special feature. We also present a general framework used to evaluate the interactions between society and ecosystem regimes and the governance regimes chosen to mediate those interactions. The case studies show different ways that adaptive governance may be triggered, facilitated, or constrained by ecological and/or legal processes. The resilience assessments indicate that complex interactions among the governance and ecosystem components of these systems can produce different trajectories, which include patterns of (a) development and stabilization, (b) cycles of crisis and recovery, which includes lurches in adaptation and learning, and (3) periods of innovation, novelty, and transformation. Exploration of cross scale (Panarchy) interactions among levels and sectors of government and society illustrate that they may constrain development trajectories, but may also provide stability during crisis or innovation at smaller scales; create crises, but may also facilitate recovery; and constrain system transformation, but may also provide windows of opportunity in which transformation, and the resources to accomplish it, may occur.

E. M.","Implementation of wildfire- and climate-adaptation strategies in seasonally dry forests of western North America is impeded by numerous constraints and uncertainties. After more than a century of resource and land use change, some question the need for proactive management, particularly given novel social, ecological, and climatic conditions. To address this question, we first provide a framework for assessing changes in landscape conditions and fire regimes. Using this framework, we then evaluate evidence of change in contemporary conditions relative to those maintained by active fire regimes, i.e., those uninterrupted by a century or more of human-induced fire exclusion. The cumulative results of more than a century of research document a persistent and substantial fire deficit and widespread alterations to ecological structures and functions. These changes are not necessarily apparent at all spatial scales or in all dimensions of fire regimes and forest and nonforest conditions. Nonetheless, loss of the once abundant influence of low- and moderate-severity fires suggests that even the least fire-prone ecosystems may be affected by alteration of the surrounding landscape and, consequently, ecosystem functions. Vegetation spatial patterns in fire-excluded forested landscapes no longer reflect the heterogeneity maintained by interacting fires of active fire regimes. Live and dead vegetation (surface and canopy fuels) is generally more abundant and continuous than before European colonization. As a result, current conditions are more vulnerable to the direct and indirect effects of seasonal and episodic increases in drought and fire, especially under a rapidly warming climate. Long-term fire exclusion and contemporaneous social-ecological influences continue to extensively modify seasonally dry forested landscapes. Management that realigns or adapts fire-excluded conditions to seasonal and episodic increases in drought and fire can moderate ecosystem transitions as forests and human communities adapt to changing climatic and disturbance regimes. As adaptation strategies are developed, evaluated, and implemented, objective scientific evaluation of ongoing research and monitoring can aid differentiation of warranted and unwarranted uncertainties.",2021,"DEC","Ecological Applications","31","8","","WOS:000706158700001","10.1002/eap.2431","","#4731","Hagmann 2021","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-23 08:36:57)(Select): c1: yes

However, given that adaptation processes are in early stages, evaluation of approaches across agency, organizational, and geographic boundaries is critical. Thus, we conducted a qualitative comparison of three conceptual frameworks for climate change vulnerability assessment and adaptation efforts in the Canadian and United States forestry agency contexts. We focus our comparison on components of the conceptual frameworks, development process, intended users, similarities and differences in institutional contexts (geographic and organizational), and implementation. Finally, we present case studies to illustrate how the frameworks have been implemented on the ground and in different contexts. Despite different trajectories of development, the Canadian and US forest agencies have developed similar conceptual frameworks for vulnerability assessment and adaptation. We found that key components of the conceptual frameworks included: establishing a science-management partnership; evaluating current forest conditions and management objectives; conducting detailed science-based vulnerability assessments; developing adaptation approaches and on-the-ground tactics; implementing adaptation tactics; and monitoring outcomes and adjusting as needed. However, the contexts in which these frameworks are implemented vary considerably within and between countries, mostly because of differences in land ownership, management norms, and organizational cultures.

The current research addresses the following questions: How do international business frameworks work for governing and enforcing the practical implementation of corporate activities? In the future, what functions are expected to work for business sectors ensuring the 2050 goals? This study examines the function of international business frameworks from different perspectives according to socio-environmental challenges, enforcement measures, organizers, and embedded problems. First, the development process of the motivation of corporate activities is examined, from Corporate Social Responsibility to the long-term vision. Second, we conduct a thorough review of the public and private regimes and identify three key components of private regimes to achieve effective, legitimate, and compliant functions: participation, accountability, and norms. These three components are not ensured by one regime, but by different types of international frameworks: industry associations, international organizations, and third parties. This study illustrates how these three types of frameworks work with the key components for enforcement. Furthermore, with increasing expectations for corporate actions, companies are creating their own visions and principles to attain the 2050 global goal.

M.","To avoid irreversible climate damages, countries with different political systems must commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the world. The challenge posed to federal countries participating in international climate agreements through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is that successful implementation requires buy-in from their subnational governments. However, subnational climate action may not be aligned with the political priorities of the national government and could either undermine or support commitments made through the agreement. To explore these dynamics, we review the incoherence between international commitments, national and subnational policies of Canada and the United States, relying on case studies of investments in low-carbon energy and emissions outcomes. Political and policy incoherence has flowed in both directions. Both countries have seen periods of federal government action, which have been undermined by subnational inaction or opposition. Similarly, both countries have seen periods of federal government inaction, which has placed the onus on subnational governments. Our analysis enables a greater understanding about how the dynamics of federalist political systems influence policy, thus the energy investment and emissions outcomes of national commitments to international agreements. The implications of our findings for other federalist political systems are discussed. We suggest that during national leadership voids, subnational governments can counteract the associated negative policy outcomes by implementing climate policies that support low-carbon technologies and reducing emissions.

Many observers now believe that a """"new"""" climate governance is emerging through transnational and/or local forms of action that will eventually plug the resulting governance gaps. Yet states, which remain oddly absent from most discussions of the """"new"""" governance, will remain key players as governance becomes more polycentric. This paper introduces a special issue that explores the ability of states to rise to these interconnected challenges through the analytical prism of policy innovation. It reveals that policy innovation is much more multi-dimensional than is often thought; it encompasses three vital activities: invention (centering on the 'source' of new policy elements), diffusion (that produces different 'patterns' of policy adoption), and the evaluation of the 'effects' that such innovations create in reality. The papers, which range from qualitative case studies to large 'n' quantitative studies, offer new insights into the varied roles that states play in relation to all three. They show, for instance that: the policy activity of states has risen dramatically in the past decade; that state innovation is affected to similar degrees by internal and external factors; and that policies that offer flexibility to target groups on how to meet policy goals are most effective but that voluntary reporting requirements are ineffective. This paper draws upon these and many other insights to offer a much more nuanced reflection on the future of climate governance; one that deservedly puts states at the front and center of analysis.

M.; Stimmelmayr, R.; Stephen, C.; Walzer, C.","The COVID-19 pandemic has re-focused attention on mechanisms that lead to zoonotic disease spillover and spread. Commercial wildlife trade, and associated markets, are recognized mechanisms for zoonotic disease emergence, resulting in a growing global conversation around reducing human disease risks from spillover associated with hunting, trade, and consumption of wild animals. These discussions are especially relevant to people who rely on harvesting wildlife to meet nutritional, and cultural needs, including those in Arctic and boreal regions. Global policies around wildlife use and trade can impact food sovereignty and security, especially of Indigenous Peoples. We reviewed known zoonotic pathogens and current risks of transmission from wildlife (including fish) to humans in North American Arctic and boreal biomes, and evaluated the epidemic and pandemic potential of these zoonoses. We discuss future concerns, and consider monitoring and mitigation measures in these changing socio-ecological systems. While multiple zoonotic pathogens circulate in these systems, risks to humans are mostly limited to individual illness or local community outbreaks. These regions are relatively remote, subject to very cold temperatures, have relatively low wildlife, domestic animal, and pathogen diversity, and in many cases low density, including of humans. Hence, favorable conditions for emergence of novel diseases or major amplification of a spillover event are currently not present. The greatest risk to northern communities from pathogens of pandemic potential is via introduction with humans visiting from other areas. However, Arctic and boreal ecosystems are undergoing rapid changes through climate warming, habitat encroachment, and development; all of which can change host and pathogen relationships, thereby affecting the probability of the emergence of new (and re-emergence of old) zoonoses. Indigenous leadership and engagement in disease monitoring, prevention and response, is vital from the outset, and would increase the success of such efforts, as well as ensure the protection of Indigenous rights as outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Resulting changes in abundance and distribution of commercially valuable species are anticipated to create or exacerbate challenges for fisheries management across national boundaries by raising questions around catch allocation, membership in the management organizations, and forms of cooperation between the organizations. In this paper we assess eight transboundary fisheries arrangements in the Northwest Atlantic and North Pacific on their preparedness to respond to climate-change driven changes. For each arrangement a three-part analysis is provided. A general introduction to fisheries management responsibilities, including species and geographic scope, is first followed by a review of how climate-related science is being supported and a discussion of how climate change is being addressed directly or indirectly in management. The review shows that none of the examined treaties and founding documents mention climate change or direct parties to include climate change in their research programs and management measures. Nevertheless, climate change is on the radar screen of all eight arrangements although adopting management approaches that do not rely on single stock assessments remains politically difficult. The seaworthiness of the eight arrangements to address climate change varies considerably. Three arrangements were categorized as the most seaworthy for investing significant resources in ecosystem-based management and climate science. Three were assessed to be moderately seaworthy for recognizing precautionary and ecosystem approaches in their treaties, or for taking steps toward this objective, as well as supporting climate science. However, they are relying on single-stock management and, at times, struggle with making decisions based on scientific evidence. Two arrangements appear to be least seaworthy because they are largely ignoring climate change and the need for an ecosystem approach in their management or have inadequate legal tools to address these needs effectively.",2020,"DEC","Ecology and Society","25","4","","WOS:000603995100011","10.5751/ES-11835-250442","","#6445","Koubrak 2020","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-26 11:02:43)(Select): review of fisheries management that is explicitly transboundary and focused on whether/how much climate change impacts these agreements.

The current use of technology will undoubtedly continue, allowing water managers to engage more stakeholders and engage them more substantively. We predict increased roles for the private and nongovernmental sectors in stakeholder engagement, taking place at different scales, but with a focus on the local level. Evaluating the benefits and effectiveness of engagement processes will help justify the investments, and also support practitioners to determine the most appropriate tools and techniques.

Over centuries or millennia, Native Americans learned that they could enhance production of desired resources by regularly igniting low-intensity surface fires in stands of black oak. Although black oak is likely to remain widespread in the future, a warming climate, increasingly dense forests, and altered fire regimes threaten the large, full-crowned mature trees that produce crops of high-quality acorns and provide cavities for many wildlife species. To examine the effects of different kinds of burns on tribal values including associated plants, fungi, and wildlife of special cultural significance, we reviewed and synthesized scientific studies of black oak in conjunction with interviews and workshops with tribal members who use the species and recall burning by their ancestors. We conducted two exploratory analyses to understand trends in large black oaks and potential tradeoffs regarding black oak restoration. Our findings identify opportunities for reintroducing low-intensity fire, in conjunction with thinning, to restore stands that are favorable for acorn gathering.

Collaboration between governments, non-governmental organizations, and communities that depend on mangroves for their livelihood will be critical in the Anthropocene. The essay also reviews recent developments in mangrove ecology and ecophysiology that enlighten how mangroves might respond to changes in temperature and rainfall, sea level rise, and other anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Mangroves in the Anthropocene will also face changes in their species composition given the current movement of mangroves species across continental barriers as a result of human activity. These trends will lead to novel mangrove forests and in some cases expand the range of mangroves worldwide. The solution to mangrove persistence in the Anthropocene is not to isolate mangroves from people, but to regulate interactions between mangroves and humans through effective management.

They differ in cultures, socioeconomics, geographies, flora and fauna, and annual average temperatures. Despite their differences, they are similar in having small percentages of global population, limited economic and political influence, growing reliance on imported food and goods, and producing relatively small amounts of greenhouse gas emissions.

Indigenous food sovereignty including control of lands were found to be factors contributing to these concerns. Therefore, our aim was to conduct a scoping review of the peer-reviewed literature to describe Indigenous disconnection from Indigenous food systems (IFS) in Canada and the US.MethodsFollowing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-SR) and Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, we searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Sociological Abstracts, and Bibliography of Native North Americans. Data was extracted from 41 studies and a narrative review completed based on study themes.ResultsThe overarching theme identified in the included studies was the impact of colonization on IFS. Four sub-themes emerged as causes for Indigenous disconnection from traditional food systems, including: climate change; capitalism; legal change; and socio-cultural change. These sub-themes highlight the multiple ways in which colonization has impacted Indigenous food systems in Canada and the US and important areas for transformation.ConclusionsEfforts to reconnect Indigenous knowledge and values systems with future food systems are essential for planetary health and sustainable development.

Monitoring these dynamics typically requires a fusion of broad-scale remote sensing observations, climate information and other geospatial data inputs, which often have unknown errors, are difficult to obtain, or limit spatial and temporal resolutions of productivity estimates. The past decade has seen notable advances in technologies and the diversity of observed wavelengths from remote sensing instruments, offering new insights on vegetation carbon dynamics. In this communication, we review key current approaches for modeling terrestrial vegetation productivity, followed by a discussion on new remote sensing instruments and derived products including Sentinel-3 Land Surface Temperature, freeze & thaw state from the Soil Moisture & Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, and soil moisture from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. We outline how these products can improve the spatial detail and temporal representation of boreal productivity estimates driven entirely by a fusion of remote sensing observations. We conclude with a demonstration of how these different elements can be integrated across key land cover types in the Hudson plains, an extensive wetland-dominated region of the Canadian boreal, and provide recommendations for future model development.

A.","In recent decades, global forecasts show that the demands for freshwater, energy, and food have been affected by population growth, economic development, international trade, and increasing urbanization and food diversity. Moreover, cultural changes and other phenomena have adversely affected the water, energy, and food (WEF) resources demand. Consequently, climate change adverse impact, which is an undesirable phenomenon, will be increased at a staggering rate. Numerous studies have emphasized that the lack of integrated and systematic management strategies threaten these indispensable resources' ability to meet growing demand. In many countries, the security of WEF resources, which is related to each other, has become three non-traditional security challenges that overshadow these communities' development. Before realizing the importance of interactions between these three vital resources, the management strategies were typically used for one source, which was completely independent of the other two. Since these strategies did not consider the interactions between the three systems, the applied strategies' results were sometimes contradictory. Also, due to the lack of attention to these three sectors' vital connections, the competition level among these systems has been increased. Therefore, in recent years, the study of the complex interactions and connections between these resources has led to the emergence of a new term called WEF nexus in the scientific communities. Most studies about the WEF nexus have only described the current situation or, ideally, analyzed several predetermined scenarios. However, the adopted approach should be able to analyze different scenarios and be efficient and robust enough to develop a variety of strategies and utilize them for macro-policies. In this study, after reviewing the complex interactions between the WEF systems, it was tried to introduce a novel paradigm for the WEF nexus, which concentrates on expanding the possible space of WEF nexus.",2023,"OCT","Environmental Science and Pollution Research","30","49","107487-107497","WOS:000621738300015","10.1007/s11356-021-13034-1","","#8372","Molajou 2023","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-23 08:57:14)(Select): c1: yes

Long-distance transport of the virus is tied to inter- and intra-continental bird migration, while enhanced viral reassortment is linked to breeding habitats in Beringia shared by migrant species from North America and Asia. Furthermore, water temperature, pH, salinity, and co-existing biota all impact the viability and persistence of the virus in the environment. Changes in climate can potentially alter the ecology of AIV through multiple pathways. Warming temperatures can change the timing and patterns of bird migration, creating novel assemblages of species and new opportunities for viral transport and reassortment. Water temperature and chemistry may also be altered, resulting in changes in virus survival.

Biocultural stewardship practices, like low-intensity fire, transplanting, and thinning, can be used in response to these stressors to support berry plant health and productivity as well as a sustained relationship with this important food.SummaryAlmost 200 different species of berries are used for food and medicine by Indigenous Peoples, with unparalleled nutritional and cultural significance among plant foods. Environmental and land-use change is increasingly compromising access to, availability of, and consumption of berries. In this review, I consider (a) how climate and land-use change are impacting cultural use berries across species and places, as documented by Indigenous Peoples and in the scientific literature, and (b) how stewardship practices are being applied to promote resilience and sustainability in berrying landscapes experiencing stress. Climate impacts on Arctic and subarctic berry species include earlier ripening, changes in taste, or increased variability in abundance. These same regions are experiencing a proliferation of shrubs, while forests throughout the lower 48 and Canada are suffering from suffocating fuel loads and stand densities that are not conducive to berry habitat for many species. In the Pacific West, berries are influenced by prolonged droughts and increasing spring and summer temperatures. Climate change impacts are amplified by shifts in land use for forestry and agriculture. Biocultural stewardship practices, like low-intensity fire, thinning, transplanting, and cultural care, can be used to mitigate these impacts and promote berry microclimate habitats. There is opportunity for intertribal networking and knowledge sharing around berry stewardship practices that will support local and regional climate change responses.

We argue that crop improvement through plant breeding is a viable strategy to enhance food security and climatic resilience in the region. The exploitation of adaptive traits: abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, yield and nutritional efficiency, is imperative in a world threatened by climatic extremes. However, the insular constraints of Fiji and other small PICs are major limitations for the utilization of PGR through high throughput techniques which are also cost prohibitive.

L.","As greenhouse gas emissions rise unabated and temperatures continue to rise, forest managers have begun to consider assisted migration (AM) of trees as a strategy to adapt forests to climate change. To investigate the risks and benefits of AM, old provenance trials have been repurposed and new common-garden experiments initiated. In this paper, we review three decades of common-garden based research into the adaptation of species and provenances (geographically specific varieties) to current and future climates in North America. Using a filtered data base of 106 papers and reports, we investigate multiple aspects of this work, including subject species, tree response variables and their climatic predictors, statistical techniques, and the patterns of adaptation revealed in results. Although the reviewed work contained valuable insights into provenance-climate relationships, much of this work focused on growth in commercial conifer species and the correlation of that growth with annual or monthly climatic averages. A minority of studies investigated the effects of climate variables with direct mechanistic effects on growth or phenology, including temperature extremes, frost and drought indices, or growing-season duration.

R.; Pitek, E.; Skoggard, I.","There is a growing interest and urgency in understanding and incorporating local knowledge and strategies into sustainable climate change adaptation. This is particularly important because as populations age and new technologies come on the scene, much local knowledge is lost to newer generations. For this reason, we have systematically examined 90 societies from the ethnographic record to explore and document the strategies that people in the past have implemented in response to serious natural hazards. Our review reveals a rich diversity of coping mechanisms and contingency plans used by societies around the world in response to different hazards, particularly floods and droughts. We collect, classify, and compare different types of coping mechanisms, focusing on four major types: technological, subsistence, economic and religious. We find that most societies employ multiple types of coping mechanisms, although our data suggest that technological coping mechanisms are the most common coping mechanisms in response to fast-onset hazards, whereas religious coping mechanisms are the most common mechanism used in response to slow-onset hazards. We also find that religious and nonreligious coping strategies are not antithetical to each other. In fact, an increased number of religious coping mechanisms is associated with an increased number of """"practical"""", nonreligious coping mechanisms.",2022,"JUN 15","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION","76","","","WOS:000832968600001","10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.102988","","#9609","Pierro 2022","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-22 05:45:38)(Select): Documentation of shifts in adaptation techniques in relation to climate change & change-driven events such as fires.

V.","The safety record of the international merchant shipping industry has shown a continual improvement for a prolonged period due to its ability to learn from incidents and prevent recurrence; through training, education, technology development and regulatory change. However, the annual rate of ship losses has remained relatively unchanged in recent years. The industry has become accustomed to a safety regulatory regime based heavily on embedding lessons from incidents. That regime has served it well for more than a century but the industry is experiencing rapid change, which presents a challenge to this approach. This paper reviews the development of the maritime safety regulatory regime and the 'proof of need' attitude to new regulations that has been created. Regulators face challenges with changes in both technology and the operational model and the paper discusses these in the context of the desire to prevent future casualties without waiting for incidents. As future societal demands lead to the introduction of novel technology in order to solve massive challenges such as climate change the risks of incidents are likely to increase. The conclusion reached is that the industry has a strong culture based on a backward-facing approach to learning from incidents but to maintain a continual improvement in safety it has to adopt a forward-facing approach of similar rigour, using some form of 'learning without the incidents'. A way forward is postulated where 'synthetic lessons' from simulated incidents that have not actually happened are 'learned' and accepted as justification within the safety regulatory regime.

This paper reviews deliberative democracy and framing where they have been applied to examine public engagement on climate change. Integrating insights from these fields can help develop a practice of deliberative framing for managing climate change mitigation and adaptation actions at local scales, to complement national and international efforts.

To examine the current state of knowledge on SSMP adoption and identify research gaps, we systematically reviewed 269 peer-reviewed publications pooled from Scopus, Web of Science and ScienceDirect, covering the period from 1994 to 2022. We assessed the temporal and spatial transitions of SSMP adoption and identified a broad perspective of 14 themes on SSMP adoption and highlight the research trends and gaps. Prior to 2010, research on SSMP adoption was concentrated on a few themes and has become diversified in later years, covering emerging themes such as climate change and use Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Publications on SSMP adoption exhibited a global distribution, with particular emphasis on the African continent due to the flow of donors' funds driven by severe soil degradation and limited use of improved technologies in Africa. Studies on minimum soil disturbance were prevalent worldwide, with the highest number of publications. Our findings also indicate a strong research collaboration between developed and developing countries, showcasing donor-driven collaborative efforts and mutual benefits across different regions.

There is evidence that conservation actions that halt, slow or reverse biodiversity loss can simultaneously slow anthropogenic mediated climate change significantly. This review highlights conservation actions which have the largest potential for mitigation of climate change. We note that conservation actions have mainly synergistic benefits and few antagonistic trade-offs with climate change mitigation. Specifically, we identify direct co-benefits in 14 out of the 21 action targets of the draft post-2020 global biodiversity framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity, notwithstanding the many indirect links that can also support both biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. These relationships are context and scale-dependent; therefore, we showcase examples of local biodiversity conservation actions that can be incentivized, guided and prioritized by global objectives and targets. The close interlinkages between biodiversity, climate change mitigation, other nature's contributions to people and good quality of life are seldom as integrated as they should be in management and policy.

This situation is assessed for two presidential terms. The previous administration was eager to locate and promote Mexico as a front-runner in climate change actions, developing national policies aimed at reducing emissions from pollution sources and actively participating at the international fora. On the other hand, the current government has followed a different approach. Now that the energy sector has been reformed, a potential increase in oil production can be expected, regardless of the promotion of renewable energy.

Here, a three-dimensional conceptual framework of 'power as domination' is applied to the UNFCCC adaptation regime. We argue that this 'power-over' framing is an important lens through which to view adaptation, a field dominated by 'power-to', capacity-based constructs. The framework distinguishes between power-over manifesting through decision-making, agenda setting and preference shaping. Through a literature review we demonstrate that first and second dimension behavioral views of power-over fail to account for the subtle ways in which the interests and preferences of smallholder farmers are unknowingly shaped and restricted within the regime. Potential sources of third dimension preference shaping power are explored in a survey with high-level decision makers involved in National Adaptation Plans (NAP) development in seven countries. The results suggest that several inter-related features of the international agriculture adaptation regime collectively contribute to the shaping of interests and preferences of smallholders: prevailing discourses of uncertainty and the perceived limited capacity of smallholders; the resulting privileged status of 'expert' decision makers; the predominance of neoliberal development rationalities; and systemic biases resulting from the nation state as the principle unit of UNFCCC negotiation. These forces lie beyond the explanatory scope of first and second dimensions of power-over and help to explain why stakeholder engagement in adaptation decision making remains superficial in nature and why adaptation responses in agriculture can be considered 'common and non-differentiated'. We argue for increased awareness of third dimension manifestations and impacts of power in adaptation literature to facilitate the improved participation of marginalized stakeholders in UNFCCC and domestic adaptation decision making forums, to increase the diversity of adaptation options available to smallholders, and ultimately, to improve the attribution of responsibility for adaptation outcomes.

National and Regional Approaches to Arctic Adaptation Governance","Tennberg, M.","The aim of this chapter is introduce adaptation to impacts of climate change as part of international climate governance in the Arctic. In the Arctic, there is a clash of two discourses - scientific discourse on concern for the impacts of climate change and neoliberal discourse of new opportunities for resource exploitation made possible by the climate change. The chapter studies the national communications of eight Arctic states to the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change since the early 1990s to analyze three related questions (1) how the concern for the climate change and its impacts are articulated as """"governable problems"""" in the national communications, (2) how the regional concern for the Arctic is manifested nationally and (3) how the agency in developing preparedness, and responses to climate change impacts are constructed in these communications. The analysis of the concern for the climate change impacts in the Arctic countries show that the national concerns are constructed by using different discursive strategies. Most of the Arctic countries have found their """"arcticness"""" after the publication of the ACIA report in 2004. The main reason for these national approaches to differ so much in their approach to the Arctic region is largely explained by the simple fact that these reports are written from the perspective of national economic interest. In this national economic interest arctic region offer natural resources and climate change in many cases promises to help the exploitation of these resources.

Among different decarbonisation strategies, knowledge about the potential role and contributions of social movements to curbing carbon emissions has been limited. This study aims to shed light on the diverse contributions of social movements to staying within the global carbon budget, as well as on the specific outcomes and strategies employed in protests against hydrocarbon activities. For this purpose, we conduct a systematic literature review of 57 empirical cases of social movements contesting fossil fuel projects in 29 countries. Based on an exploratory approach, we identify a series of different movement strategies and a range of qualitative contributions that support staying within the carbon budget. These include raising awareness of risks and strategies, enhancing corporate responsibility, being informed about policy changes, laws and regulations, fostering just energy transitions, energy democracy, divestment, alternative market solutions, and forcing the postponement or cancellation of targeted hydrocarbon activities. While the institutional means are widely used and seem to support policy change and regulation, these strategies are not used to deliver awareness or postponement outcomes. Similarly, while movements tend to rely on civil disobedience to stop hydrocarbon projects in the short term, they rely on multiple strategies to cancel them in the longer term.

Forms of international co-ordination include: harmonising carbon prices (e.g. through linking carbon markets), extending the coverage of pricing schemes, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, developing international sectoral agreements, and establishing co-ordination mechanisms to mitigate carbon leakage. All forms of international co-operation on carbon pricing could deliver benefits, both economic (e.g. lower mitigation costs) and environmental (e.g. reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon leakage). There is scope to considerably increase the coverage of carbon pricing, since until 2021 only around 40% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 44 OECD and G20 countries face a carbon price. There is also significant scope to improve international co-ordination on carbon pricing: moving from unilateral carbon prices to a globally harmonized carbon price to reach the 1st round of NDC targets for 2030 can reduce global mitigation cost on average by two thirds or $229 billion. Benefits tend to be higher with broader participation of countries, broader coverage of emissions and sectors and, more ambitious policy goals. Extending carbon pricing to non-CO2 GHG could reduce global mitigation costs by up to 48%. Absolute cost savings from harmonized carbon prices increase by almost 70% in 2030 for reductions in line with the 2 degrees C target. Most, but not all, countries gain economic benefits from international co-operation, and these benefits vary significantly across countries and regions. Complementary measures outside co-operation on carbon pricing (e.g. technology transfers) could potentially ensure that co-operation provides economic benefits for all countries.",2021,"NOV","Environmental Research Letters","16","11","","WOS:000709100400001","10.1088/1748-9326/ac2b61","","#12133","Thube 2021","","Intervention; Sociocultural; Transboundary unclear",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Climato-economic theorizing proposes that humans adapt needs, stresses, and choices of goals, means, and outcomes to the livability of their habitat. The evolutionary process at work is one of collectively meeting climatic demands of cold winters or hot summers by using monetary resources. Freedom is expected to be lowest in poor populations threatened by demanding thermal climates, intermediate in populations comforted by undemanding temperate climates irrespective of income per head, and highest in rich populations challenged by demanding thermal climates. This core hypothesis is supported with new survey data across 85 countries and 15 Chinese provinces and with a reinterpretative review of results of prior studies comprising 174 countries and the 50 states in the United States. Empirical support covers freedom from want, freedom from fear, freedom of expression and participation, freedom from discrimination, and freedom to develop and realize one's human potential. Applying the theory to projections of temperature and income for 104 countries by 2112 forecasts that (a) poor populations in Asia, perhaps except Afghans and Pakistanis, will move up the international ladder of freedom, (b) poor populations in Africa will lose, rather than gain, relative levels of freedom unless climate protection and poverty reduction prevent this from happening, and (c) several rich populations will be challenged to defend current levels of freedom against worsening climato-economic livability.",2013,"OCT","BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES","36","5","465-480","WOS:000325681000001","10.1017/S0140525X12002828","","#12456","VandeVliert 2013","","Sociocultural; Transboundary unclear",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

One of the challenges in its successful implementation has been community involvement in its design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The purpose of this study is to assess what REDD?+?can learn from the experience of Community-Based Ecotourism (CBET), which operates under many of the same conditions. A critical review of the related literature using the Scopus database was undertaken using three search strings including ?REDD+? (2,913 listings), ?community-based ecotourism?

"58","A systematic review of the trophic ecology of eight ecologically and culturally important fish species in the North American Arctic","Wight, K. J.; McNicholl, D. G.; Dunmall, K. M.","Rapid climate change occurring in the Arctic may affect the diet of ecologically and culturally important northern fish species. Here, a systematic literature review was completed for eight fish species found across the North American Arctic, with a focus on Inuit Nunangat, to identify major prey items, summarize feeding strategies, and highlight data gaps. Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus), Dolly Varden Char (Salvelinus malma), Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush), Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus), Inconnu (Stenodus leucichthys), Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), Broad Whitefish (Coregonus nasus), and Burbot (Lota lota), were selected as species of interest due to their ecological and cultural importance. The 74 studies reviewed indicate that these species are generalist feeders that demonstrate wide dietary niches, as well as the tendency to avoid agonistic interactions by partitioning resources when they co-occur with an overlapping species. Across coastal, lacustrine, and riverine systems, the most commonly consumed prey items are insects (Diptera spp.), as well as benthic forage fishes such as sculpins (Family: Cottidae). Insects are major prey items in riverine systems, where diets appear to be more generalized, compared to lakes. Anadromous species in coastal waters most commonly feed on various crustaceans and forage fishes. Benthic forage fishes, insects, zooplankton, and mollusks are widely consumed prey items in Arctic lakes. Burbot, Inconnu, and resident Dolly Varden had the most specialized feeding strategies, due in part to their habitat requirements and morphology, while Lake Trout and resident Arctic Char often form multiple ecotypes in lakes, some with different feeding behaviors. Knowledge gaps regarding northern fish trophic ecology are highlighted, and in particular include riverine systems and winter foraging behavior.

Y.","Geopolitics of energy transition has increasingly become the frontier and hot research area of world energy geography and global political science. Different historical periods are characterised by obvious differences in energy connotations, attributes, and geopolitical characteristics. In the new energy era, energy geopolitics becomes more diversified, complex, and comprehensive. In this paper, we compare the geopolitical characteristics of energy in the fossil fuel and renewable energy periods, and provide an overview of current study trends in new energy geopolitics. Recent research shows that the global energy transition will intensify the reconstruction of geopolitical patterns, change the relationship between geopolitical security and conflict dominated by traditional energy security, alter the role of different countries in global energy geopolitical games, reshape national energy relationships formed in the traditional oil and gas era. In addition, geopolitics will be affected by new energy technologies, availability of key rare materials, and energy cybersecurity measures. Despite considerable attention to this research topic, the likely geopolitical impact of energy transition remains uncertain, and there is still room for the development and improvement of the theoretical framework, technical methods, and research perspective. Looking forward to the future, the research into geopolitics of energy transition urgently needs to strengthen its theoretical basis and rely on the scientific and quantitative methods. The practical conclusions of the research into geopolitics of energy transition should strengthen major national energy security decisions, explore the geographical effect of energy transition, and determine the impact of energy transition on energy security.

It is categorized as endangered by the IUCN and by Canada under the Species at Risk Act and was recently proposed for listing in the U.S. as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Whitebark pine populations are declining nearly rangewide primarily from the spread and intensification of Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch., the exotic, invasive pathogen that causes white pine blister rust (WPBR); recent, large-scale outbreaks of mountain pine beetles (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins); altered fire regimes; and, multiple impacts from climate change. For more than two decades, researchers and managers within the U.S. Forest Service and Canadian forestry agencies have been developing restoration and conservation tools and techniques to help mitigate these threats. Four conservation and restoration principles for whitebark pine were previously emphasized: (1) conserve genetic diversity, (2) promote WPBR resistance, (3) protect seed sources, and (4) deploy restoration treatments, while mitigating for climate change. These principles are served by ten additional management or conservation actions that form the basis of a restoration and adaptive management plan but apply primarily to regions with moderate to high levels of WPBR and MPB outbreaks. Where the pathogen and MPB are absent or present at low levels, managers can implement proactive management to build resilience to prevent the future loss of ecological function. Here, we review the key management actions currently used for whitebark pine conservation and restoration in the U.S. and Canada, which include gene conservation, increasing natural genetic resistance to C. ribicola, cone collections, growing and planting seedlings or directly sowing seeds, protecting seed sources, prescribed fire and silvicultural thinning to reduce competition in late seral communities, proactive intervention, stand health surveys and monitoring, and monitoring the impacts of restoration for adaptive management. This review is the outcome of an experts' workshop held in association with the development of the National Whitebark Pine Restoration Plan (NWPRP), a collaborative U.S. multi-agency and tribal effort initiated in 2017 in consultation with the U.S. Forest Service and facilitated by the non-profit organizations, the Whitebark Pine Ecosystem Foundation and American Forests.",2022,"/","Forest Ecology and Management.","522","","","","10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119929","IND607588854","#14481","Tomback 2022","Colleen Miller (2024-08-23 00:47:14)(Select): discuss various ways pine is attacked (spread of beetles, fires) in US and CAN, and how people are managing pines; ","Potentially relevant; Sociocultural",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Warmer temperatures are expected to increase disease risks from food-borne pathogens, water-borne diseases, and vector-borne zoonoses in human and animal populations of Arctic landscapes. Existing high levels of mercury and persistent organic pollutant chemicals circulating within terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in Arctic latitudes are a major concern for the reproductive health of humans and other mammals, and climate warming will accelerate the mobilization and biological amplification of toxic environmental contaminants. The adverse health impacts of Arctic warming will be especially important for wildlife populations and indigenous peoples dependent upon subsistence food resources from wild plants and animals. Additional research is needed to identify and monitor changes in the prevalence of zoonotic pathogens in humans, domestic dogs, and wildlife species of critical subsistence, cultural, and economic importance to Arctic peoples. The long-term effects of climate warming in the Arctic cannot be adequately predicted or mitigated without a comprehensive understanding of the interactive and synergistic effects between environmental contaminants and pathogens in the health of wildlife and human communities in Arctic ecosystems.

"64","Saltmarshes in a time of change","Adam, P.; Polunin, N. V. C.","This review discusses the factors that influence the development and future condition and survival of salt marshes. Of critical importance are changes in relative sea level and in tidal range. Relative sea level is affected by changes in absolute sea level, changes in land level and the capacity of salt marshes to accumulate and retain sediment. Many salt marshes are starved of sediment because of catchment modification and coastal engineering, or exposed to erosive forces, which may be natural origin or reflect human interference. Pressures on the environment created by the continued increase in the human population, particularly in developing tropical countries, and the likely consequences of the enhanced greenhouse effect on both temperature and sea level give rise to particular concerns. Humans have modified salt marshes directly and intensively in many ways for a variety of purposes, viz., as a cultural landscape, land claim, evaporative salt production, aquaculture, insect control, tidal power, tidal barriers, water storage, pollution (by oil, industrial chemicals and eutrophication), and introduced species. The impact of these factors on the change of salt marshes in Kent and Essex (southeast England), Morecambe Bay (northwest England) and in Louisiana (USA), as well as the changes in the distribution and abundance of native species are discussed. By 2025, global sea level rise and warming will have impacts on salt marshes.

It assesses both local and global effects of changing agricultural yields on the economy subnational regions, and different household types, including male- and female-headed households in Brazil, Mexico, and Peru. The three countries reflect economic and geographic diversity in Latin America and more than half of the region's population. MAIN FINDINGS: Climate change impacts tend to be relatively small at an economywide level in all three countries. However, sectoral and household-level economic impacts tend to be diverse across countries and subnational levels. They mainly depend on projected changes in agricultural yields, the share of agriculture in regional gross domestic product (GDP), crop-specific international trade balances, net food buyer/seller position, and income diversification of households. As for gender, results from this study suggest that female-headed households may be less vulnerable than male-headed households to the effects of climate change, highlighting the importance of considering women as a source for solutions for building resilience to climate change. Given the relatively small impacts of climate change and the degree of uncertainty associated with them, it is too early to define specific policy recommendations.

In the eastern boreal forest of Canada, there are two major types of natural disturbances that can generate large amounts of biomass for the production of bioenergy: wildfire and spruce budworm outbreak. For example, the mean burned area between 1970 and 2010 was estimated at 2900 km2 per year. Following such disturbances, typically only trees and stands with a merchantable value, i.e., of acceptable quality for traditional forest products (lumber and pulp) are salvaged. However, adding bioenergy to the potential basket of products may both divert trees of marginal quality and profitability away from traditional products and to bioenergy facilities and lengthen the window of opportunity during which salvage operations can occur. This review shows how the dynamics of wood characteristics of trees affected by natural disturbances can be used to predict through time the basket of wood products that can be taken out of a salvaged stand and ensure the best fit between sources of fibre and types of processing facilities. The most important factors influencing fibre quality include degradation caused by fungi and insects. The most suitable time to salvage trees for the production of lumber in stands killed by either spruce budworm or fire is generally limited to 1-2 years after death. For the production of pulp and paper, trees can usually be salvaged for as long as the wood moisture content remains above the fibre saturation point, but usually is not recommended after 3 or 4 years following death. Thus, past this period, salvaged trees may yield better opportunities for the bioenergy sector. Information on wood as bioenergy feedstock (wood chips, wood pellets and liquid biofuel) highlights the importance of wood chemical components in the chemical reactivity of biofuel. This study offers background knowledge and a framework of analysis that highlights the potential of dead wood from natural disturbances for the production of forest and bioenergy products, which can be further adapted to other regions of the world, building on the Canadian experience of adapting practices to natural disturbances.",2015,"","Forestry (Oxford)","88","3","275-290","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/cpv007","","#16444","Barrette 2015","Tyler McIntosh (2024-09-11 06:45:26)(Select): c1: yes

"68","Ontario's forests and forestry in a changing climate","Colombo, S. J.","This report updates a review of literature about the effects of global climate change on forest plants and communities published ten years ago (Forest Research Information Paper No. 143). Since the previous review, evidence of environmental changes caused by elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and its potential effects on global climate has strengthened considerably, to the point that there are reports that the effects of climate change are already being observed. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicates that rates of greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase due to fossil fuel burning and deforestation. Based on a less-than-worst-case scenario, the IPCC """"A2"""" scenario, and modelled using the Canadian Global Climate Model (CGCM2), increased atmospheric CO2 is projected to increase average summer temperatures in Ontario between 3 degrees C and 6 degrees C by 2070, with the largest increases in the far north but with heavily populated parts of the province warming by 4 degrees C to 5 degrees C. Growing season precipitation is predicted to increase only slightly (<10%) in much of Ontario, and to decrease in southern and northwestern Ontario. Projected increases in summer temperatures with no or little increase in precipitation would increase the frequency and severity of drought by elevating evapotranspiration. One predictable response to drier forests is increased forest area burned. The projected increase is for a doubling of area burned in parts of the province where fire suppression is not practiced. In the managed forest, however, where more people live and where forests are more heavily used for timber production and recreation, most fires are currently able to be suppressed through early action. However, under severe fire weather conditions, initial attack at present can be unsuccessful, and climate change is expected to increase severe fire weather. As a result, an anticipated effect of climate change is increased frequency of uncontainable forest fire spread, resulting in more large burns in areas of managed forest. The complex interactions of trees with insects and disease makes it difficult to project the timing and extent of effects of climate change on these disturbances. However, if drought increases tree stress, the occurrence and severity of insect and disease outbreaks are likely to increase. In addition to drought, extreme weather events, such as wind storms, flooding, and very high temperatures could stress plants and increase insect and disease outbreaks. As a result, most important diseases of Ontario trees are expected to increase, and none are anticipated to decline. Cold winters that have historically kept some insects out of Ontario will occur less frequently, resulting in possible expansions of their ranges. For example, mountain pine beetle, which in recent years expanded its range into boreal forests in northern Alberta, may reach Ontario's pine forests before 2050. Climate change will increasingly make species and local populations of tree species less well adapted to the climate where they occur. For some species, this will reduce growth at the centre of their range and increase growth closer to the northern end of their distribution. The long lives of trees and their slow natural migration means that natural processes will be unable to move seed fast enough to match changing climate. Increasingly, forest managers will consider planting non-local species and populations. Such potential adaptations, however, need to be carried out with consideration of potential negative consequences and if implemented should be well documented and monitored. Risks to forests from implementing adaptation strategies need to be weighed against the risks to forests if chosen actions affect current species biodiversity. For this reason, a coordinated, science-based approach to forest adaptation can help forest managers determine possible strategies for reducing the negative effects of climate change. This report describes an approach termed """"judicious adaptation"""", in which risk of da age from implementing an adaptation is weighed against the risk of not acting. Adaptations carrying high risk would require strong evidence that failing to act creates an imminent threat. Low risk strategies would have a requirement for documentation of results to allow improved understanding of the risks and benefits of undertaking the adaptation. Judicious adaptation has similarities to the adaptive management approach, because of the requirements for planning and monitoring in both. According to the IPCC, sustainable forest management that maintains forest carbon stocks and provides a sustained yield of wood products provides the best long-term climate change mitigation strategy for forests. Wood products from forests store carbon, but also can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels by using wood as an alternative energy source (either burned directly or burning methane generated by wood products in landfills). Solid wood products have considerably lower energy intensity than building materials such as steel, aluminum, brick, and concrete. Therefore, using wood in place of such other materials reduces emissions of greenhouse gases and is an indirect way that forests can contribute to mitigating climate change.",2008,"","Climate Change Research Report - Ontario Forest Research Institute","","CCRR-12","22-pp","","","","#17442","Colombo 2008","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-16 13:30:22)(Select): Lots of explicit discussion of range shifts, especially northward.

There are limited studies that have established how the climate-induced disasters have impacted the ICH elements of food. As such, there is need to first establish the ICH elements or components of food and then how these ICH elements of food are being affected by climate change-induced disasters. This review was therefore aimed at identifying based on the literature the different ICH elements of food and how these can be affected by climate-induced disasters such as floods, cyclones, and droughts. This review paper shows that food is not only considered an ICH because of it being specific to a territory or ethnic group, but there are several dimensions or elements of food that makes it qualify as an ICH, which we grouped into six categories or domains. These domains of food as ICH are (i) food traditions and customs, (ii) food production, processing, and storage, (iii) dietary culture, (iv) eating and social practices, (v) culinary, and (vi) geographical indications. These ICH domains of food as ICH we created them based on the similarity of the different characteristics of the ICH elements are identified in the literature. This new insight is useful in assessing the impact of climate-induced natural disasters on intangible cultural heritage in food systems. More so, the identified categories of ICH elements of food can be viewed as constructs in a framework that can be used to assess the impact of climate-induced disasters on intangible cultural heritage in food systems and the ultimate impact on nutrition outcomes. Further research can be directed toward the development of a framework or tool to enable the assessment of the impact of climate-induced natural disasters on intangible cultural heritage in food systems.",2022,"","Journal of Ethnic Foods","9","32","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s42779-022-00147-2","","#17733","Dembedza 2022","","Sociocultural; Transboundary unclear",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

These so called """"globally networked risks"""" pose fundamental challenges to global governance institutions. A growing literature explores the nature of these globally networked or """"systemic"""" risks. While this research has taught us much about the anatomy of these risks, it has consistently failed to integrate insights from the wider social sciences. This is problematic since the prescriptions that result from these efforts flow from naive assumptions about the way real-world state and non-state actors behave in the international arena. This leaves serious gaps in our understanding of whether networked environmental risks at all can be governed. The following essay brings together decades of research by different disciplines in the social sciences, and identifies five multi-disciplinary key insights that can inform global approaches to governing these. These insights include the influence of international institutions; the dynamics and effect of international norms and legal mechanisms; the need for international institutions to cope with transboundary and cross-sectoral crises; the role of innovation as a strategy to handle unpredictable global risks; and the necessity to address legitimacy issues.",2017,"","Risk, Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy","8","1","4-27","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rhc3.12108","","#18421","Galaz 2017","Rachel Wilwerding (2024-08-14 04:34:37)(Select): Potentially relevant- insight into major factors that influence efficacy of international governance initiatives;","Potentially relevant; Sociocultural; Transboundary unclear",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"72","The great lapse: climate change, water resources and economic risks in the Great Lakes","Kehl, J.","The striking vastness of the world's largest surface freshwater resource, the Laurentian Great Lakes, has generated the fallacy that they are not highly vulnerable to climate change. This fallacy has created a great lapse in our research and understanding of the effects of climate change on the Great Lakes, which are approaching critical environmental thresholds and jeopardizing ecosystem services. This article takes the novel approach of correcting the disconnect between the perception of vastness and the reality of vulnerability to climate change in the Great Lakes, and takes an additional novel step to link the water risks with the economic risks. The primary purpose is to demonstrate the interdependence of the freshwater ecosystem services affected by climate change with the economies that are highly dependent on those freshwater services in the Great Lakes region. Although many believe that environmental science or ethical arguments should be sufficient to warrant action on climate change, evidence shows that policy-makers are not compelled to generate advances unless there are strong economic components. This article highlights the leading edge of climate science for the Great Lakes, having conducted 32 in depth interviews with experts in microbiology, ecology, and limnology, among others, but it also adds substantively to previous work by providing economic evidence of water risks in the agricultural sector and energy sector, which constitute over $6 trillion in value and jobs that are specifically dependent on lakes waters. The article concludes by articulating three specific conclusions: the economic viability of the agricultural sector and the energy sector are jeopardized by loss of federal funding for climate change adaptation in the water sector; the existing policies such as between sectors such as the Farm Bill and Energy Future Bill are mal-aligned and should be aligned with the water sector; and negative environmental externalities including factors that exacerbate climate change should be incorporated into the true cost of water so we can more accurately conduct ecosystem valuation and, thus, address the true economic and environmental cost of climate change on the Great Lakes and our greatest water resources.

C.","Rangeland social-ecological systems (SESs), which make up vast tracts of Earth's terrestrial surface, are facing unprecedented change-from climate change and vegetation transitions to large-scale shifts in human land use and changing social and economic conditions. Understanding how people who manage and depend on rangeland resources are adapting to change has been the focus of a rapidly growing body of research, which has the potential to provide important insights for climate change adaptation policy and practice. Here, we use quantitative, qualitative, and bibliometric analyses to systematically review the scope, methods, and findings of 56 studies that examine the social dimensions of adaptation in rangeland SESs. Our review focuses on studies within the climate adaptation, adaptive capacity, and adaptive decision-making sub-fields, finding that this body of research is highly diverse in its disciplinary roots and theoretical origins, and therefore uses a wide range of frameworks and indicators to evaluate adaptation processes. Bibliometric analyses revealed that the field is fragmented into distinct scholarly communities that use either adaptive capacity or adaptive decision-making frameworks, with a lack of cross-field citation. Given the strengths (and weaknesses) inherent in each sub-field, this review suggests that greater cross-pollination across the scholarship could lead to new insights, particularly for capturing cross-scale interactions related to adaptation on rangelands. Results also showed that a majority of studies that examine adaptation in either """"ranching"""" or """"rangeland"""" systems are geographically concentrated in few, high-income countries (i.e., USA, Australia, China), demonstrating a need to extend future research efforts to understudied regions of the globe with rangeland-based livelihoods.

Since local communities are relying on the same marine food web as marine mammals in the Arctic, it requires a One Health approach to understand the holistic ecosystem health including that of humans. Here we collect and identify gaps in the current knowledge of health in the Arctic and present the veterinary perspective of One Health and ecosystem dynamics. The review shows that exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is having multiple organ-system effects across taxa, including impacts on neuroendocrine disruption, immune suppression and decreased bone density among others. Furthermore, the warming Arctic climate is suspected to influence abiotic and biotic long-range transport and exposure pathways of contaminants to the Arctic resulting in increases in POP exposure of both wildlife and human populations. Exposure to vector-borne diseases and zoonoses may increase as well through range expansion and introduction of invasive species. It will be important in the future to investigate the effects of these multiple stressors on wildlife and local people to better predict the individual-level health risks.

D.; Chan, HingMan","This study examined critical impacts of climate change on Inuit diet and nutritional health in four Inuit communities in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Western Arctic, Canada. The first objective was to combine data from community observation studies and dietary interview studies to determine potential climate change impacts on nutritional quality. The second objective was to address the scale of data collection and/or availability to compare local versus regional trends, and identify implications for adaptation planning. Information was compiled from 5 reports (4 community reports and 1 synthesis report) of climate change observations, impacts and adaptations in 12 Inuit communities (2005-2006), and from a dietary report of food use from 18 Inuit communities (1997-2000). Changing access to, availability of, quality of, and ability to use traditional food resources has implications for quality of diet. Nutritional implications of lower traditional food use include likely reductions in iron, zinc, protein, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids, among others. The vulnerability of each community to changing food security is differentially influenced by a range of factors, including current harvesting trends, levels of reliance on individual species, opportunities for access to other traditional food species, and exposure to climate change hazards.

While existing literature extensively examines climate-induced migration, there is a lack of studies considering the compounding impacts of multiple climate hazards on migration, mobility, and immobility. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review to explore how climate-induced stressors, specifically rising temperatures, water stress and droughts, and floods and sea-level rise, have affected populations in the Global South, leading to voluntary and/or forced migration. Our findings show that these stressors have displaced and profoundly impacted millions of people, resulting in both internal and transboundary migration. Climate-induced stressors often trigger migration through indirect pathways influenced by multiple intervening institutional, political, and socio-economic factors and programmatic and policy gaps. Effectively addressing challenges related to climate-induced migration necessitates adaptation strategies that adequately consider the impacts of these intervening factors while recognizing their differential effects on various socio-demographic groups. We argue that support from Global North countries, including compensation for loss and damage, along with continued institutional and financial support from international non-governmental organizations, is crucial for managing climate-induced migration in the Global South. Without proper planning and adequate resources, migration may escalate and significantly impact human security.

This trend is particularly pronounced in the context of climate change, demonstrated by the accumulation of a vast body of scholarship over multiple decades. Our work provides the first systematic review of the state of this knowledge, mapping out how phase-out is studied and employed as a policy tool for mitigating climate change. We systematically review over 400 publications, spanning three decades (1990–2021) and diverse scientific fields. Our review asks: how has scholarly work discussed phase-out as an approach to mitigate climate change, and how has this changed over time? We tackle this question from five perspectives: (a) elements targeted by phase-outs, (b) policy instruments, (c) affected industries, (d) geographic context, and (e) benefits besides climate change mitigation. Results reveal that phase-out has widely proliferated as a decarbonisation approach, developing into a bridging concept that links diverse communities of contemporary science and practice. This is reflected by engagement with manifold phase-out targets—stretching well beyond the usual suspects related to fossil fuels and end-use technologies—as well as discussion of a growing diversity of industries, policy instruments and geographies in the literature. This global proliferation of phase-outs is propelled by expectations of diverse co-benefits. Aside from gains for the environment, economy, society and health, we find widespread acknowledgment that phase-out can drive innovation and systemic change beyond the mere substitution of problematic technologies and materials. Our study also identifies several underdeveloped and underrepresented directions meriting further study. These notably include phase-out activity beyond Europe, North America and China, hard-to-abate industry sectors and non-fossil fuel targets. We conclude by carving out broader implications for scholars and practitioners to inform future research directions and climate mitigation efforts.",2022,"12-01","Environmental Research Letters","17","12","123002","","https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac9fe3","","#26194","Trencher 2022","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-28 08:49:18)(Select): c1: yes

Given the rapid rate of environmental change in the Arctic, the potential ramifications on the health of marine mammals in this region are a particular concern. There are eleven endemic Arctic marine mammal species (AMMs) comprising three cetaceans, seven pinnipeds, and the polar bear (Ursus maritimus). All of these species are dependent on sea ice for survival, particularly those requiring ice for breeding. As air and water temperatures increase, additional species previously non-resident in Arctic waters are extending their ranges northward, leading to greater species overlaps and a concomitant increased risk of disease transmission. In this study, we review the literature documenting disease presence in Arctic marine mammals to understand the current causes of morbidity and mortality in these species and forecast future disease issues. Our review highlights potential pathogen occurrence in a changing Arctic environment, discussing surveillance methods for 35 specific pathogens, identifying risk factors associated with these diseases, as well as making recommendations for future monitoring for emerging pathogens. Several of the pathogens discussed have the potential to cause unusual mortality events in AMMs. Brucella, morbillivirus, influenza A virus, and Toxoplasma gondii are all of concern, particularly with the relative naivety of the immune systems of endemic Arctic species. There is a clear need for increased surveillance to understand baseline disease levels and address the gravity of the predicted impacts of climate change on marine mammal species.",2023,"01-01","Pathogens","12","7","937","","https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens12070937","","#26619","Barratclough 2023","","Biotic; Sociocultural",TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
