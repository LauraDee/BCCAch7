"1","The easternmost tropical Pacific. Part II: Seasonal and intraseasonal modes of atmospheric variability","Amador, J. A.; Durán-Quesada, A. M.; Rivera, E. R.; Mora, G.; Sáenz, F.; Calderón, B.; Mora, N.","This is Part II of a two-part review about climate and climate variability focused on the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) and the Caribbean Sea (CS). Both parts are aimed at providing oceanographers, marine biologists, and other ocean scientists, a guiding base for ocean-atmosphere interaction processes affecting the CS, the ETP, and the waters of Isla del Coco. Isla del Coco National Park is a Costa Rican World Heritage site. Part I analyzed the mean fields for both basins and a larger region covering 25 degrees S - 35 degrees N, 20 degrees W - 130 degrees W. Here we focus on a smaller area (65 degrees W - 95 degrees W, 0 degrees - 20 degrees N), as a complement to Part 1. Incoming solar radiation and surface energy fluxes reveal the complex nature of the ETP and CS for convective activity and precipitation on seasonal and intraseasonal time scales. Both regions are relevant as sources of evaporation and the associated moisture transport processes. The American Monsoon System influences the climate and climate variability of the ETP and CS, however, the precise way systems affect regional precipitation and transport of moisture, within the Intra Americas Sea (IAS) are not clear. Although the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CLLJ) is known to act as a conveyor belt for moisture transport, intraseasonal and seasonal modes of the CLLJ and their interactions with other IAS systems, have to be further investigated. Trans-isthmic jets, exert a variable seasonal wind stress force over the ocean surface co-generating regions of great marine productivity. Isolated convection, the seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the hurricane season, the Mid-Summer Drought, the seasonal and intraseasonal behavior of low-level jets and their interactions with transients, and the southward incursion of cold fronts contribute to regional seasonal precipitation. Many large-scale systems, such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO, also influence the variability of precipitation by modulating regional features associated with convection and precipitation. Monthly tropical storm (TS) activity in the CS and ETP basins is restricted to the period May-November, with very few cases in December. The CS presents TS peak activity during August, as well as for the number of hurricanes and major hurricanes, in contrast to the ETP that shows the same features during September. Rev. Biol.

C.","Intertidal ecology has been considered the cradle of modern marine ecology with insightful investigations on the biological and ecological mechanisms allowing """"life between the tides"""". Most of the early investigations focused on macrophytes (seagrasses and macroalgae) and benthic invertebrates inhabiting emerged intertidal substrata. However, tidepools also shelter a rich fauna, including fishes, which display a wide diversity and a variety of ecological interactions and functions. Here, we review the diversity, ecology, evolution and conservation of the American tidepool fishes, from definition to trophic roles, ecological vulnerabilities and societal importance that reveal an extraordinary biodiversity and the important roles fishes play in the coastal ecosystems. Tidepool fish studies increased sharply from the mid twentieth century onwards, but many geographic gaps still exist. Tidepool fishes connect marine and terrestrial communities via substantial predation upon insects and exporting energy to land as prey for terrestrial fauna. Sea-level rise driven by climate change will reduce or eliminate current intertidal habitats, where little or no space is available for landward accommodation in the supralittoral zone. Concurrently, tidepool habitat would be 'squeezed' to a narrow intertidal stripe by 'coastal squeeze' process. Endemic, habitat-restricted, and specialist species could be particularly affected by human-induced habitat loss on the coastal stripe. Tidepool fishes provide many ecological services, such as well-being, environmental awareness, outdoor recreation, and bioinspiration for ancient and current societies. The level of intertidal rocky shore protection varies among American countries, but in most cases rocky shores are included in the least effective protection categories allowing extractive activities.",2023,"DEC","Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries","33","4","1263-1290","WOS:001070349500002","10.1007/s11160-023-09798-z","","#461","Andrades 2023","","Biophysical",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"3","Climate Change Impacts on Water Resources and Sustainable Water Management Strategies in North America","Asif, Z.; Chen, Z.; Sadiq, R.; Zhu, Y. Y.","Water scarcity is exacerbating in many regions across North America because of climate change compounded by population growth, overexploitation of freshwater resources, and lack of proper management. Considering the regional urgency, there is an immense need to find more equitable solutions for water management. Therefore, this paper aims to examine the climatic factors impacting the hydrological regime in North America, including changes in surface runoff, groundwater storage, and the forested watershed, based on current trends and future projection scenarios. Moreover, this paper critically overviews need-based solutions for effective water management at a regional scale. The study shows that many areas of North America are exposed to extreme events such as prolonged droughts, devastating floods, wildfires, and altering precipitation patterns. Consequently, these changes are triggering wide-ranging impacts on water resources, leading to water supply deficiencies and influencing water flows and quality in the Southwestern United States, prairie provinces in Canada, and Mexico. The projection of warming around the region experiences spatial and seasonal variations because of the diversity in climatic conditions. Overall, in North America, winter is expected to warm more than other seasons causing earlier runoff and a decline in snowmelt. Given the physical and economic constraints that limit the development of new utilities, emphasis should be placed on strengthening nature-based solutions such as green infrastructure. Thus, the findings suggest an integrated water resource management approach is required, along with climate-induced innovative technologies, to secure the water resources while preparing for the forecasted challenges of tomorrow.",2023,"MAY","Water Resources Management","37","6-7","2771-2786","WOS:000936063200001","10.1007/s11269-023-03474-4","","#618","Asif 2023","","Biophysical",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

M.; Monroy-Vilchis, O.","Habitat connectivity is essential to mitigate the effects of fragmentation by maintaining ecological processes, exchange of individuals, and gene flow among isolated populations. In the last two decades, the importance of habitat connectivity has been highlighted and the number of studies that address this issue has increased. We review and describe the habitat-connectivity studies for the Carnivora in the Americas to identify taxonomic, geographic, and methodological biases, and we examine the number of publications on habitat connectivity and their relationship with country-level parameters. We reviewed habitat-connectivity studies published between 2000 and 2020. We quantified studies by region, country, family, and species. We identified information gaps and analysed each country based on the proportion of land modified by humans, species richness, percentage of carnivoran species that are at risk of extinction, and the percentage of territory that is within Protected Areas. G-tests were performed to verify if the number of published connectivity studies differed based on these variables. There is an increasing trend in the number of studies; however, this increasing is not proportional among countries, among families, or among carnivoran species. We identified that there is a regional bias, since more than 75% of the studies were carried out in North America, in addition, taxonomic bias indicates that the studies focused on large carnivorans. Regarding the methodological bias, the least-cost path was the most used approach. There are fewer studies on habitat connectivity in countries with higher fragmentation rates, higher percentages of species that are at risk of extinction and less percentage of land in Protected Areas. The capability of countries to invest in research, the study focused on large charismatic species and the difficulty to obtaining dispersion data are factors that have influenced in the study of habitat connectivity.",2023,"APR","Mammal Review","53","2","99-115","WOS:000941062600001","10.1111/mam.12312","","#789","Balbuena-Serrano 2023","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-17 03:58:04)(Select): most relevant for interventions section but including because the paper mentions transboundary grizzly corridors between US and Canada.

"5","Environmental Evaluation: Lessons Learned from Case Studies","Banjoko, B.; Eslamian, S.","Drought is a compelling global environmental phenomenon, and meteorological conditions have been observed to be the most important factors in the evolution of drought. Manifestations of drought vary from place to place but water deficit underpins all types of these manifestations. The impact of drought can be overwhelming, and environmental evaluation enables the determination of the degree of impact, which is normally classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Some of these environmental evaluations include air, temperature, rainfall (precipitation), soil temperature, crop performance, and occurrence of El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, there is no single method that can properly capture the onset and the severity of drought; hence, multiple approaches are being utilized for detection and mitigation. Satellites, computers, communication and information technology, modeling, and mathematical algorithms are some of the technologies employed in the environmental evaluation of drought. Being a global disaster, there is a need for international cooperation in information sharing and technological transfer, training, and capacity building with regard to drought prediction, monitoring, mitigation, and management, particularly with respect to developing countries. Continuous environmental evaluation and more research are desirable in drought management, particularly the interfaces between drought and other related extreme events like floods and forest fires. All these will enable different countries to develop drought mitigation and management policies and to improve the existing ones.",2016,"","HANDBOOK OF DROUGHT AND WATER SCARCITY: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND ANALYSIS OF DROUGHT AND WATER SCARCITY","","","631-663","WOS:000465343300033","10.1201/9781315226781","","#837","Banjoko 2016","","Biophysical",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

G.; Salcedo-Sanz, S.","Heat waves (HWs) can cause large socioeconomic and environmental impacts. The observed increases in their frequency, intensity and duration are projected to continue with global warming. This review synthesizes the state of knowledge and scientific challenges. It discusses different aspects related to the definition, triggering mechanisms, observed changes and future projections of HWs, as well as emerging research lines on subseasonal forecasts and specific types of HWs. We also identify gaps that limit progress and delineate priorities for future research. Overall, the physical drivers of HWs are not well understood, partly due to difficulties in the quantification of their interactions and responses to climate change. Influential factors convey processes at different spatio-temporal scales, from global warming and the large-scale atmospheric circulation to regional and local factors in the affected area and upwind regions. Although some thermodynamic processes have been identified, there is a lack of understanding of dynamical aspects, regional forcings and feedbacks, and their future changes. This hampers the attribution of regional trends and individual events, and reduces the ability to provide accurate forecasts and regional projections. Sustained observational networks, models of diverse complexity, narrative-based methodological approaches and artificial intelligence offer new opportunities toward process-based understanding and interdisciplinary research. Plain Language Summary Heat waves (HWs) are climate extremes of major societal concern whose frequency, intensity and duration will continue increasing during this century. This review synthesizes the physical understanding and the main scientific challenges. We discuss problems involved in HW definition, including the diversity of HW indicators, and the consideration of adaptive capabilities in a changing climate. We also review observed and projected trends and the associated atmospheric patterns in different areas of the globe, with special attention to the mechanisms and drivers responsible for HW occurrence. These act at different scales, from planetary to local, and include thermodynamic and dynamical processes. There is a limited and fragmentary understanding of the interactions among these processes on regional scales, and their changes under global warming. Process-based understanding will benefit HW forecasts at time horizons longer than weather predictions, attribution of HW trends and events to human activities, and regional climate projections.

"7","Carrion cycling in food webs: comparisons among terrestrial and marine ecosystems","Beasley, J. C.; Olson, Z. H.; DeVault, T. L.","In light of current global changes to ecosystem function (e.g. climate change, trophic downgrading, and invasive species), there has been a recent surge of interest in exploring differences in nutrient cycling among ecosystem types. In particular, a growing awareness has emerged concerning the importance of scavenging in food web dynamics, although no studies have focused specifically on exploring differences in carrion consumption between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In this forum we synthesize the scavenging literature to elucidate differences in scavenging dynamics between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and identify areas where future research is needed to more clearly understand the role of carrion consumption in maintaining ecosystem function within each of these environments. Although scavenging plays a similar functional role in terrestrial and aquatic food webs, here we suggest that several fundamental differences exist in scavenging dynamics among these ecosystem types due to the unique selection pressures imposed by the physical properties of water and air. In particular, the movement of carcasses in marine ecosystems (e.g. wave action, upwelling, and sinking) diffuses biological activity associated with scavenging and decomposition across large, three-dimensional spatial scales, creating a unique spatial disconnect between the processes of production, scavenging, and decomposition, which in contrast are tightly linked in terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, the limited role of bacteria and temporal stability of environmental conditions on the sea floor appears to have facilitated the evolution of a much more diverse community of macrofauna that relies on carrion for a higher portion of its nutrient consumption than is present in terrestrial ecosystems. Our observations are further discussed as they pertain to the potential impacts of climate change and trophic downgrading (i.e. removal of apex consumers from ecosystems) on scavenging dynamics within marine and terrestrial ecosystems.",2012,"JUL","Oikos","121","7","1021-1026","WOS:000305614300004","10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20353.x","","#973","Beasley 2012","Grace Westphal (2024-08-13 09:02:40)(Select): Only the last two pages (1/3 of article) focus on climate change impacts on carrion cycling.

"8","Carbon dynamics in lakes of the boreal forest under a changing climate","Benoy, G.; Cash, K.; McCauley, E.; Wrona, F.","Water-covered lands comprise approximately 30% of the total area of the world's boreal forest biome. Most of these lands are peatlands (i.e., bogs and fens), which store over half of the total carbon in the biome. Because climate warming threatens to alter the carbon stocks of peatlands, much attention has been devoted to understanding the climatic and hydrologic conditions that affect peatland biogeochemistry. However, there are other aquatic systems that are widespread in the boreal forest that also process and store carbon, including lakes and ponds. Although non-peatland aquatic systems cover a much smaller portion of the boreal landscape, they still contain approximately 15% of the total carbon pool for the biome, much of it stored as either profundal or littoral sediments. Further, the carbon dynamics of boreal lakes are dynamically coupled to watershed processes. Excepting major disturbances to boreal catchments, such as forest fires and forest harvest, surface waters are the only locations of net loss of carbon to the atmosphere. Our objectives are to review what is known about factors that affect lake ecosystem carbon dynamics in the boreal forest and to identify areas of study that we deem to be profitable for forecasting the impacts of climate change on carbon pools and flux rates. We primarily focus on the boreal forest of North America, but recognize that our findings may also be relevant for boreal areas of Fennoscandia and Russia. The following research priorities are identified: (i) estimation of carbon pools in profundal and littoral sediments across the boreal forest, (ii) warming experiments that include quantification of ecosystem carbon dynamics in addition to measuring changes to aquatic food web structure, (iii) whole system experiments to understand the hydrologic and biogeochemical conditions by which allochthonous carbon is integrated into aquatic food webs, especially in the context of increased nutrient concentrations associated with a warmer, and possibly drier, climate, as forecast for the southern boreal forest, (iv) watershed-scale assessment of carbon budgets for lakes that straddle transitional zones between the boreal forest and prairie-parkland, temperate forest or tundra, to detect evidence of ecosystem migration, and (v) integration of lacustrine carbon pools and flux rates into carbon budgets at scales that range from local watersheds to the boreal forest biome.",2007,"","Environmental Reviews","15","","175-189","WOS:000253048300009","10.1139/A07-006","","#1078","Benoy 2007","Elliott Parsons (2024-08-27 08:52:15)(Select): 1 = yes (this is a review), 2 = yes (ecosystem migration is mentioned so flow is biotic, and climate change is considered), 3 = biodiversity is mentioned - see page 183, 4 = yes, within NA geography, 5 yes (see ecosystem migration, and as southern range of boreal forest is in US, this implies a shift over the border).

"9","Future Evolution of Greenland's Marine-Terminating Outlet Glaciers","Catania, G. A.; Stearns, L. A.; Moon, T. A.; Enderlin, E. M.; Jackson, R. H.","Mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) has increased over the last two decades in response to changes in global climate, motivating the scientific community to question how the GrIS will contribute to sea-level rise on timescales that are relevant to coastal communities. Observations also indicate that the impact of a melting GrIS extends beyond sea-level rise, including changes to ocean properties and circulation, nutrient and sediment cycling, and ecosystem function. Unfortunately, despite the rapid growth of interest in GrIS mass loss and its impacts, we still lack the ability to confidently predict the rate of future mass loss and the full impacts of this mass loss on the globe. Uncertainty in GrIS mass loss projections in part stems from the nonlinear response of the ice sheet to climate forcing, with many processes at play that influence how mass is lost. This is particularly true for outlet glaciers in Greenland that terminate in the ocean because their flow is strongly controlled by multiple processes that alter their boundary conditions at the ice-atmosphere, ice-ocean, and ice-bed interfaces. Many of these processes change on a range of overlapping timescales and are challenging to observe, making them difficult to understand and thus missing in prognostic ice sheet/climate models. For example, recent (beginning in the late 1990s) mass loss via outlet glaciers has been attributed primarily to changing ice-ocean interactions, driven by both oceanic and atmospheric warming, but the exact mechanisms controlling the onset of glacier retreat and the processes that regulate the amount of retreat remain uncertain. Here we review the progress in understanding GrIS outlet glacier sensitivity to climate change, how mass loss has changed over time, and how our understanding has evolved as observational capacity expanded. Although many processes are far better understood than they were even a decade ago, fundamental gaps in our understanding of certain processes remain. These gaps impede our ability to understand past changes in dynamics and to make more accurate mass loss projections under future climate change. As such, there is a pressing need for (1) improved, long-term observations at the ice-ocean and ice-bed boundaries, (2) more observationally constrained numerical ice flow models that are coupled to atmosphere and ocean models, and (3) continued development of a collaborative and interdisciplinary scientific community. Plain Language Summary Increasing mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) in response to changes in global climate has motivated the scientific community to understand how much sea level rise will happen in the coming decades. Observations now indicate that the impact of a melting GrIS are more widespread than just sea-level rise and include changes to ocean properties and circulation, nutrient and sediment cycling, and ecosystem function. Major uncertainties still hamper accurate predictions of these impacts, particularly for outlet glaciers in Greenland that terminate in the ocean because their flow is strongly controlled by multiple processes that alter their boundary conditions at the ice-atmosphere, ice-ocean, and ice-bed interfaces. Many of these processes change on a range of overlapping timescales and are challenging to observe. Here we review the scientific progress in understanding how GrIS outlet glaciers respond to climate and how our understanding has changed over time as observations have increased. We conclude with recommendations for (1) improved, long-term observations at the ice- ocean and ice-bed boundaries, (2) more observationally-constrained ice flow models that are linked to atmosphere and ocean models, and (3) continued development of a collaborative and interdisciplinary scientific community.",2020,"FEB","JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE","125","2","","WOS:000519719500008","10.1029/2018JF004873","","#1932","Catania 2020","","Biophysical",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

E.; Roulet, N.; Eugster, W.; Kasischke, E.; Rastetter, E. B.; Zimov, S. A.; Running, S. W.","Synthesis of results from several Arctic and boreal research programmes provides evidence for the strong role of high-latitude ecosystems in the climate system. Average surface air temperature has increased 0.3 degreesC per decade during the twentieth century in the western North American Arctic and boreal forest zones. Precipitation has also increased, but changes in soil moisture are uncertain. Disturbance rates have increased in the boreal forest; for example, there has been a doubling of the area burned in North America in the past 20 years. The disturbance regime in tundra may not have changed. Tundra has a 3-6-fold higher winter albedo than boreal forest, but summer albedo and energy partitioning differ more strongly among ecosystems within either tundra or boreal forest than between these two biomes. This indicates a need to improve our understanding of vegetation dynamics within, as well as between, biomes. If regional surface warming were to continue, changes in albedo and energy absorption would likely act as a positive feedback to regional warming due to earlier melting of snow and, over the long term, the northward movement of treeline. Surface drying and a change in dominance from mosses to vascular plants would also enhance sensible heat flux and regional warming in tundra. In the boreal forest of western North America, deciduous forests have twice the albedo of conifer forests in both winter and summer, 50-80% higher evapotranspiration, and therefore only 30-50% of the sensible heat flux of conifers in summer. Therefore, a warming-induced increase in fire frequency that increased the proportion of deciduous forests in the landscape, would act as a negative feedback to regional warming. Changes in thermokarst and the aerial extent of wetlands, lakes, and ponds would alter high-latitude methane flux. There is currently a wide discrepancy among estimates of the size and direction of CO2 flux between high-latitude ecosystems and the atmosphere. These discrepancies relate more strongly to the approach and assumptions for extrapolation than to inconsistencies in the underlying data. Inverse modelling from atmospheric CO2 concentrations suggests that high latitudes are neutral or net sinks for atmospheric CO2, whereas field measurements suggest that high latitudes are neutral or a net CO2 source. Both approaches rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify. The most parsimonious explanation of the available data is that drying in tundra and disturbance in boreal forest enhance CO2 efflux. Nevertheless, many areas of both tundra and boreal forests remain net sinks due to regional variation in climate and local variation in topographically determined soil moisture. Improved understanding of the role of high-latitude ecosystems in the climate system requires a concerted research effort that focuses on geographical variation in the processes controlling land-atmosphere exchange, species composition, and ecosystem structure. Future studies must be conducted over a long enough time-period to detect and quantify ecosystem feedbacks.",2000,"DEC","Global Change Biology","6","","211-223","WOS:000166799900015","10.1046/j.1365-2486.2000.06022.x","","#2042","Chapin 2000","","Biophysical; Intervention; Perspective paper",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

A consequence of global warming and the resultant climate change is the rise in cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyano-HABs) across the world, which pose a threat to public health, aquatic biodiversity, and the livelihood of communities that depend on these water systems, such as farmers and fishers. An increase in cyano-HABs and their intensity is associated with an increase in the leakage of cyanotoxins. Microcystins (MCs) are hepatotoxins produced by some cyanobacterial species, and their organ toxicology has been extensively studied. Recent mouse studies suggest that MCs can induce gut resistome changes. Opportunistic pathogens such as Vibrios are abundantly found in the same habitat as phytoplankton, such as cyanobacteria. Further, MCs can complicate human disorders such as heat stress, cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Firstly, this review describes how climate change mediates the rise in cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms in freshwater, causing increased levels of MCs. In the later sections, we aim to untangle the ways in which MCs can impact various public health concerns, either solely or in combination with other factors resulting from climate change.

Following high-severity fire, forest recovery may be compromised by lack of tree seed sources, warmer and drier postfire climate, or short-interval reburning. A potential outcome of the loss of resilience is the conversion of the prefire forest to a different forest type or nonforest vegetation. Conversion implies major, extensive, and enduring changes in dominant species, life forms, or functions, with impacts on ecosystem services. In the present article, we synthesize a growing body of evidence of fire-driven conversion and our understanding of its causes across western North America.

"13","Impact of climate change on catchment nutrient dynamics: insights from around the world","Costa, D.; Sutter, C.; Shepherd, A.; Jarvie, H.; Wilson, H.; Elliott, J.; Liu, J.; Macrae, M.","This study is a meta-analysis of global articles on hydrological nutrient dynamics to determine trends and consensus on: (1) the effects of climate change-induced hydrological and temperature drivers on nutrient dynamics and how these effects vary along the catchment continuum from land to river to lake; (2) the convergence of climate change impacts with other anthropogenic pressures (agriculture, urbanization) in nutrient dynamics; and (3) regional variability in the effects of climate change on nutrient dynamics and water-quality impairment across different climate zones. An innovative web crawler tool was employed to help critically synthesize the information in the literature. The literature suggests that climate change will impact nutrient dynamics around the globe and exacerbate contemporary water-quality challenges. Nutrient leaching and overland flow transport are projected to increase globally, promoted by extreme precipitation. Seasonal variations in stream flow are expected to emulate changing precipitation patterns, but the specific local impacts of climate change on hydrology and nutrient dynamics will vary both seasonally and regionally. Plant activity may reduce some of this load in nonagricultural soils if the expected increase in plant uptake of nutrients prompted by increased temperatures can compensate for greater nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) mineralization, N deposition, and leaching rates. High-temperature forest and grass fires may help reduce mineralization and microbial turnover by altering N speciation via the pyrolysis of organic matter. In agricultural areas that are at higher risk of erosion, extreme precipitation will exacerbate existing water-quality issues, and greater plant nutrient uptake may lead to an increase in fertilizer use. Future urban expansion will amplify these effects. Higher ambient temperatures will promote harmful cyanobacterial blooms by enhancing thermal stratification, increasing nutrient load into streams and lakes from extreme precipitation events, decreasing summer flow and thus baseflow dilution capacity, and increasing water and nutrient residence times during increasingly frequent droughts.

A.; Prepas, E. E.; Richman, M. B.; Winter, T. C.","The Great Plains landscape is less topographically complex than most other regions within North America, but diverse aquatic ecosystems, such as playas, pothole lakes, ox-bow lakes, springs, groundwater aquifers, intermittent and ephemeral streams, as well as large rivers and wetlands, are highly dynamic and responsive to extreme climatic fluctuations. We review the evidence for climatic change that demonstrates the historical importance of extremes in north-south differences in summer temperatures and east-west differences in aridity across four large subregions. These physical driving forces alter density stratification, deoxygenation, decomposition and salinity. Biotic community composition and associated ecosystem processes of productivity and nutrient cycling respond rapidly to these climatically driven dynamics. Ecosystem processes also respond to cultural effects such as dams and diversions of water for irrigation, waste dilution and urban demands for drinking water and industrial uses. Distinguishing climatic from cultural effects in future models of aquatic ecosystem functioning will require more refinement in both climatic and economic forecasting. There is a need, for example, to predict how long-term climatic forecasts (based on both ENSO and global warming simulations) relate to the permanence and productivity of shallow water ecosystems. Aquatic ecologists, hydrologists, climatologists and geographers have much to discuss regarding the synthesis of available data and the design of future interdisciplinary research.

Here we present a meta-analysis of the impacts of climate fluctuation and Euro-Canadian settlement on burned areas from 1850 to 1990 in a large zone (>100 000 km(2)) in northern temperate and boreal forests of eastern Canada. Using Cox regression models, we tested for potential statistical relationships between historical burned areas in 12 large landscapes (reconstructed with dendrochronological data) with climate reconstructions, changes in the Euro-Canadian population, and active suppression (all reconstructed at the decadal scale). Our results revealed a dominant impact of climate fluctuations on forest burned areas, with the driest decades showing fire hazards between 5 to 15 times higher than the average decades. Comparatively, the Euro-Canadian settlement had a much weaker effect, having increased burned areas significantly only during less fire-prone climate conditions. During periods of fire-prone climate, burned areas were maximum independent of fluctuations in Euro-Canadian populations. Moreover, the development of active fire suppression did not appear to reduce burned areas. These results suggest that a potential increase in climate moisture deficit and drought may trigger unprecedented burned areas and extreme fire events no matter the effects of anthropogenic ignition or suppression.",2021,"NOV","Environmental Research Letters","16","11","","WOS:000709104000001","10.1088/1748-9326/ac2ce7","","#2708","Danneyrolles 2021","","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

"17","Invoking adaptation to decipher the genetic legacy of past climate change","de Lafontaine, G.; Napier, J. D.; Petit, R. J.; Hu, F. S.","Persistence of natural populations during periods of climate change is likely to depend on migration (range shifts) or adaptation. These responses were traditionally considered discrete processes and conceptually divided into the realms of ecology and evolution. In a milestone paper, Davis and Shaw (2001) Science 292:673 argued that the interplay of adaptation and migration was central to biotic responses to Quaternary climate, but since then there has been no synthesis of efforts made to set up this research program. Here we review some of the salient findings from molecular genetic studies assessing ecological and evolutionary responses to Quaternary climate change. These studies have revolutionized our understanding of population processes associated with past species migration. However, knowledge remains limited about the role of natural selection for local adaptation of populations to Quaternary environmental fluctuations and associated range shifts, and for the footprints this might have left on extant populations. Next-generation sequencing technologies, high-resolution paleoclimate analyses, and advances in population genetic theory offer an unprecedented opportunity to test hypotheses about adaptation through time. Recent population genomics studies have greatly improved our understanding of the role of contemporary adaptation to local environments in shaping spatial patterns of genetic diversity across modern-day landscapes. Advances in this burgeoning field provide important conceptual and methodological bases to decipher the historical role of natural selection and assess adaptation to past environmental variation. We suggest that a process called """"temporal conditional neutrality"""" has taken place: some alleles favored in glacial environments become selectively neutral in modern-day conditions, whereas some alleles that had been neutral during glacial periods become under selection in modern environments.

A.; Yousefpour, R.","Forest thinning can significantly affect hydrological processes. However, these effects largely vary with forest types, climate, thinning intensity, and hydrological variables of interest. Understanding these effects and their variations can significantly support thinning treatments' design and selection to ensure desired hydrological benefits. In this global-level review paper, we report the first comprehensive meta-analysis on the effects of thinning on major hydrological processes with an emphasis on rainfall partitioning, soil moisture and evapotranspiration processes. The synthesized and reviewed studies encompass different biophysical conditions (climate and forest ecosystems), silvicultural systems, and time scales (from weeks to decades) across continents. The results showed a significant increase in net precipitation, soil moisture and tree-level water use after thinning (the effect sizes are 1.19, 1.14 and 1.56 relative to the value of the control, respectively), while decreases in stemflow and transpiration (the effect sizes of 0.42 and 0.6 relative to the value of the control, respectively). Thinning intensity of about 50% of the stand density is determined as the threshold at or over which hydrological processes are significantly affected. The duration of thinning effect can be set between 2.6 and 4.3 (throughfall) and 3.1-8.6 years (soil moisture and transpiration), asking for repeated thinning in order to effectively sustain these effects. These global averages can serve as benchmarks for assessment and comparisons, but the effects of thinning depend on local biophysical conditions and thinning treatments. The literature review on the rest of the studied hydrological variables suggests that thinning generally enhance runoff to increase water yield and groundwater recharge. Thinning can also have a positive or limited role in water use efficiency (WUE), but it mitigates the effects of drought through increasing WUE. Moderate adverse effects on water quality can be prevented by adequate forest managements to prevent soil degradation. Nevertheless, more researches at relatively less studied regions are needed to support a more robust analysis of these reviewed hydrological variables. The management implications of the synthesized and reviewed results are suggested and discussed within the context of climate change.",2022,"SEP 1","Forest Ecology and Management","519","","","WOS:000821335600001","10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120324","","#2914","delCampo 2022","","Biophysical; Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

S.","Kelp forests worldwide are threatened by both climate change and localized anthropogenic impacts. Species with cold-temperate, subpolar, or polar distributions are projected to experience range contractions over the coming decades, which may be exacerbated by climatic events such as marine heatwaves and increased freshwater and sediment input from rapidly contracting glaciers. The northeast Pacific has an extensive history of harvesting and cultivating kelps for subsistence, commercial, and other uses, and, therefore, declines in kelp abundance and distributional shifts will have significant impacts on this region. Gaps in our understanding of how cold-temperate kelp species respond to climate stressors have limited our ability to forecast the status of kelp forests in future oceans, which hampers conservation and management efforts. Here, we conducted a structured literature review to provide a synthesis of the impacts of multiple climate-related stressors on kelp forests in the northeast Pacific, assess existing knowledge gaps, and suggest potential research priorities. We chose to focus on temperature, salinity, sediment load, and light as the stressors most likely to vary and impact kelps as climate change progresses. Our results revealed biases in the existing literature toward studies investigating the impacts of temperature, or temperature in combination with light. Other stressors, particularly salinity and sediment load, have received much less focus despite rapidly changing conditions in high-latitude regions. Furthermore, multiple stressor studies appear to focus on kelp sporophytes, and it is necessary that we improve our understanding of how kelp microstages will be affected by stressor combinations. Finally, studies that investigate the potential of experimental transplantation or selective cultivation of genotypes resilient to environmental changes are lacking and would be useful for the conservation of wild populations and the seaweed aquaculture industry.",2023,"JUL","Ecology and Evolution","13","7","","WOS:001021452700001","10.1002/ece3.10277","","#3212","Drakard 2023","","Biophysical; Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

All scale processes are active and interplay from small-scale turbulent mixing to basin-scale circulation. The IPCZ acts as an """"oceanic bridge"""" for the inter-basin mass transports and basin-scale planetary waves, closely linking basin-scale circulations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Numerous straits in the Indonesian Seas provide oceanic channels for planetary waves propagating between the tropical Pacific and the southeast Indian Ocean. On a large scale, the inter-basin mass transports and planetary waves change the ocean thermal structure, triggering strong air-sea interactions, and further regulating the variability of Walker and Hadley Circulations.

However, concerns have been raised about the threat that climate change poses to the functions of oceans. This study examines the impacts, threats, and adaptation strategies of climate change and marine biodiversity. Using bibliometric and secondary data analysis, this study determines that climate change leads to rising sea temperatures, marine heatwaves, acidification, and increasing sea levels. These factors undermine the significance of ocean ecosystem services. This study also identifies the significant risks posed by climate change to marine species diversity and distribution, primarily through habitat degradation and shifts in species ranges. Scholarly focus on these challenges has grown over time, focusing on adaptation strategies and building resilience to mitigate adverse impacts. This study critically evaluates various adaptation measures, including nature-based and human-based solutions such as habitat restoration, policy and legislative frameworks, and their potential to protect marine ecosystems. It provides detailed discussions on the effectiveness of adaptation strategies such as marine protected areas (MPAs), mangrove and coral reef restoration, and species range shifts. This review also emphasises the significance of indigenous knowledge systems and community participation in marine conservation efforts to achieve holistic and sustainable management. It highlights the need for enhanced international cooperation and a transdisciplinary approach to address the complex interplay between climate change and marine biodiversity.

Accumulated state assessments of aquatic systems is an integral component of watershed cumulative effects assessment. The Yukon River is the largest free flowing river in the world and is the fourth largest drainage basin in North America, draining 855000km(2) in Canada and the United States. Because of its remote location, it is considered pristine but little is known about its cumulative state.

M.","This paper addresses the impacts of climate change on forest fires and describes how this, in turn, will impact on the forests of the United States. In addition to reviewing existing studies on climate change and forest fires we have used two transient general circulation models (GCMs), namely the Hadley Centre and the Canadian GCMs, to estimate fire season severity in the middle of the next century. Ratios of 2 x CO2 seasonal severity rating (SSR) over present day SSR were calculated for the means and maximums for North America. The results suggest that the SSR will increase by 10-50% over most of North America; although, there are regions of little change or where the SSR may decrease by the middle of the next century. Increased SSRs should translate into increased forest fire activity. Thus, forest fires could be viewed as an agent of change for US forests as the fire regime will respond rapidly to climate warming. This change in the fire regime has the potential to overshadow the direct effects of climate change on species distribution and migration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

S.","The Holocene record of eolian sand and loess deposition is reviewed for numerous presently stabilized dune fields on the Great Plains of North America. Dune field activity reflects decade-to-century-scale dominance of drought that exceeded historic conditions, with a growing season deficit of precipitation > 25%. The largest dune fields, the Nebraska Sand Hills and ergs in eastern Colorado, Kansas and the Southern High Plains showed peak activity sometime between ca. 7 and 5 cal. ka. Loess deposition between ca. 10 and 4 cal. ka also signifies widespread aridity. Most dune fields exhibit evidence for one or more reactivation events sometime in the past 2 cal. ka; a number of localities register two events post 1 cal. ka, the latest potentially after 1400 AD. However, there is not a clear association of the latest dune remobilization events with up to 13 droughts in the past 2 cal. ka identified in dendroclimatic and lacustrine records. Periods of persistent drought are associated with a La Nina-dominated climate state, with cooling of sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean and later of the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico that significantly weakens cyclogenesis over central North America. As drought proceeds, reduced soil moisture and vegetation cover would lessen evaporative cooling arid increase surface temperatures. These surface changes strengthen the eastward expansion of a high-pressure ridge aloft and shift the jet stream northward, further enhancing continent-wide drought. Uncertainty persists if dune fields will reactivate in the future at a scale similar to the Holocene because of widespread irrigation, the lack of migratory bison herds, and the suppression of prairie fires, all of which enhance stabilization of dune fields in the Great Plains.

We review the state of knowledge of mangrove Vulnerability and responses to predicted climate change and consider adaptation options. Based on available evidence, of all the climate change outcomes, relative sea-level rise may be the greatest threat to mangroves. Most mangrove sediment surface elevations are not keeping pace with sea-level rise, although longer term studies from a larger number of regions are needed. Rising sea-level will have the greatest impact oil mangroves experiencing net lowering in sediment elevation, where there is limited area for landward migration. The Pacific Islands mangroves have been demonstrated to be at high risk of substantial reductions. There is less certainly over other climate change outcomes and mangrove responses. More research is needed on assessment methods and standard indicators of change in response to effects from climate change, while regional monitoring networks are needed to observe these responses to enable educated adaptation. Adaptation measures can offset anticipated mangrove losses and improve resistance and resilience to climate change. Coastal planning can adapt to facilitate mangrove migration with sea-level rise. Management of activities within the catchment that affect long-term trends in the mangrove sediment elevation, better management of other stressors oil mangroves, rehabilitation of degraded mangrove areas, and increases in systems of strategically designed protected area networks that include mangroves and functionally linked ecosystems through representation, replication and refugia, are additional adaptation options.

In this Invited Commentary, the authors briefly review the health impacts of climate change, examine current climate change course offerings and proposals, and describe the rationale for promptly and comprehensively including climate science education in medical school curricula. Efforts in training physicians now will benefit those physicians' communities whose health will be impacted by a period of remarkable climate change. The bottom line is that the health effects of climate reality cannot be ignored, and people everywhere must adapt as quickly as possible.",2021,"MAR","ACADEMIC MEDICINE","96","3","324-328","WOS:000639307900015","10.1097/ACM.0000000000003861","","#4432","Goshua 2021","Maya-Lin Green (2024-08-25 17:36:26)(Select): The paper is a review and focuses on climate change impacts related to the spread of vector-borne diseases and climate driven human migration.

"30","The state of glacier hydrology research in Canada","Hanly, K.; Marshall, S.; McDowell, G.","Glaciers across Canada are rapidly retreating, engendering significant implications for glacier-fed hydrological systems, ranging from aquatic ecology and groundwater recharge to downstream economic activities and traditional cultural values. Despite a well-developed body of literature regarding glacio-hydrological systems and dynamics, there has been no systematic assessment of this research to date. In response, this study adopted a systematic review methodology to examine the state of existing peer-reviewed glacio-hydrological literature in Canada (1900-2021). We found that peer-reviewed glacio-hydrological research in Canada emerged in the early 1950s and has substantially grown over the last two decades, with almost all work being done by natural scientists using field-based approaches to examine physical hydrology, water quantity and resources, and water quality in western Canada. There is a declining trend in research related to glacio-hydrological hazards and a relative lack of research related to glacier ecohydrology, human vulnerability, and adaptation. The absence of such work constrains our ability to adapt to the consequences of climatic change and other anthropogenic stressors. In highlighting these gaps, this study aims to inform research needs and contribute to evidence-based policy formation that supports regionally appropriate plans, enhancing our ability to navigate the current and future challenges facing glacio-hydrologic systems in Canada, including the human and non-human systems that depend on them.

The 2019 conference focused on assessing ecosystem health based on 61 indicators. Although there has been considerable improvement in the Detroit River since the 1960s, much additional cleanup is needed to restore ecosystem health. Western Lake Erie is now at risk of crossing several potential tipping points caused by the interactions of a variety of drivers and their stresses. This assessment identified eight environmental and natural resource challenges: climate change; population growth/transportation expansion/land use changes; chemicals of concern; human health/environmental justice; aquatic invasive species; habitat loss/degradation; nonpoint source pollution; and eutrophication/harmful algal blooms. Specific recommendations for addressing each challenge were also made. Climate change is the most pressing environmental challenge of our time and considered a ``threat multiplier"""" whereby warmer, wetter, and more extreme climatic conditions amplify other threats such as poor air quality effects on vulnerable residents, species changes, and nonpoint source runoff and combined sewer overflow events that contribute to eutrophication and can manifest as harmful algal blooms.

They also offer many benefits to humankind and are considered essential to the mitigation of the effects of climate change. Nevertheless, throughout the world they are suffering the most intense of anthropogenic pressures so are, of all ecosystems, among the most endangered. Here, we bring together and synthesise existing ecological understanding of the mechanisms underlying the high heterogeneity and diversity of temperate floodplain forests and of the pressures threatening their high biological value due to habitat homogenisation. Floodplain forests depend on the periodic disturbances under which they evolved, including fluvial dynamics, traditional management practices and the activities of herbivores. However, they have been heavily degraded by climate change, invasion of exotic species, river-flow regulation, landscape fragmentation, eutrophication and the cessation of traditional management. We can now observe two general trends in temperate floodplain forests: (1) Due to intensive landscape exploitation, they are now more open and thus prone to the spread of competitive species, including of invasive exotics and (2) Due to the cessation of traditional management, along with modified hydrological conditions, they are composed of species in the later successional stages (i.e., more shade-tolerant and mesic) while light-demanding species are quickly vanishing. Restoration practices have brought about contrasting results when restoration of floodplains to their natural states has been problematic. This is likely because of interplay between various natural and artificial processes not previously taken into proper consideration. We would like to draw attention to the fact that restoration projects or the preservation of existing floodplain forest ecosystems should combine the restoration of watercourses with the mitigation of other important threats acting at different scales of the landscape (spread of invasive species, eutrophication of watersheds and inappropriate forest management).",2023,"JAN 1","Science of the Total Environment","854","","","WOS:000867707800013","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158743","","#4936","Havrdová 2023","Elliott Parsons (2024-10-30 13:20:41)(Select): 1 (yes it is a review), 2 = yes, climate change impacts on hydrology, flooding, 3 = yes, mentions composition of forests, 4 = North America = yes (review restricted to northern hemisphere)., 5 = 1 (highly likely - map 1 C shows Canada & US.; Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-15 11:48:30)(Select): Figure 3 shows species at the U.S.-Canada border and the rest of the paper discusses changing floodplain areas.

In response, coniferous forest ecosystems will transition toward dominance by fire-adapted hardwoods, shrubs, meadows, and grasslands, which may benefit some faunal communities, but not others. We describe factors that limit and promote faunal resilience to shifting wildfire regimes for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We highlight the potential value of interspersed nonforest patches to terrestrial wildlife. Similarly, we review watershed thresholds and factors that control the resilience of aquatic ecosystems to wildfire, mediated by thermal changes and chemical, debris, and sediment loadings. We present a 2-dimensional life history framework to describe temporal and spatial life history traits that species use to resist wildfire effects or to recover after wildfire disturbance at a metapopulation scale. The role of fire refuge is explored for metapopulations of species. In aquatic systems, recovery of assemblages postfire may be faster for smaller fires where unburned tributary basins or instream structures provide refuge from debris and sediment flows. We envision that more-frequent, lower-severity fires will favor opportunistic species and that less-frequent high-severity fires will favor better competitors. Along the spatial dimension, we hypothesize that fire regimes that are predictable and generate burned patches in close proximity to refuge will favor species that move to refuges and later recolonize, whereas fire regimes that tend to generate less-severely burned patches may favor species that shelter in place.

Despite the importance of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services to Arctic Indigenous communities, there have been limited attempts to summarise available Indigenous Knowledge (IK) regarding Arctic freshwater systems and to understand how conservation can benefit from this knowledge base. This paper presents a systematic review of literature documenting circumpolar Arctic IK with a focus on freshwater biodiversity in Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland), Russia, and the U.S.A. (Alaska). Standardised search terms and methodologies were used to locate relevant documents using Google Scholar and Google Advanced search engines. Thematic coding was used to identify freshwater biodiversity themes within the identified documents. Documented IK of freshwater biodiversity was found from all five geographic regions and included data on both species presence and habitat changes with potential to affect biodiversity. Canada had the highest number of relevant documents (n = 127), followed by the U.S.A. (Alaska;n = 116), Fennoscandia (n = 38), Russia (n = 27), and Greenland (n = 5). The number of relevant documents with IK published per year was highest in most recent years, from 2010 onwards, in all geographic regions. Fish represented the highest number of faunal observations with 59 species observed, approximately half of which were Salmonidae (29 species). Local-scale assessment of fish diversity found observations of the highest number of species (11-25) in Alaska, and individual observations of 6-10 species were found throughout Alaska, mainland areas of Canada, and the Kola Peninsula in Russia. Documented IK also contributed new information on historical fish diversity and indicated local-scale loss or gain of species. Such information is of vital importance to provide long-term records of fish composition and abundance, especially when this information does not exist in other knowledge bases such as western science datasets. Indigenous Knowledge included observations of changes in freshwater and terrestrial habitat associated with a warming climate, such as: decreasing water levels and more draining/drying of lakes and rivers, a shorter period of ice cover (late freeze and early break-up), decreasing ice thickness, and increasing occurrence of permafrost thaw and eroding banks. Such observations by those who actively rely on Arctic freshwater ecosystem services are important because they signify that change is occurring and that action is needed to mitigate the impacts on freshwater habitats and the biodiversity therein. This study demonstrates that previously documented IK provides valuable information towards determining freshwater biodiversity baselines and patterns of change in the circumpolar Arctic. However, these results do not sufficiently cover the depth and breadth of IK on freshwater biodiversity and ecology held by Indigenous communities. Further work incorporating Indigenous worldviews around freshwater ecology would provide context to the knowledge collected and a deeper understanding of Arctic circumpolar freshwater environments.",2022,"JAN","Freshwater Biology","67","1","194-209","WOS:000546714600001","10.1111/fwb.13570","","#6344","Knopp 2022","","Biophysical",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

E.; Manen, F. T. V.","Climate change poses a pervasive threat to humans and wildlife by altering resource availability, changing cooccurrences, and directly or indirectly influencing human-wildlife interactions. For many wildlife agencies in North America, managing bears (Ursus spp.) and human-bear interactions is a priority, yet the direct and indirect effects of climate change are exacerbating management challenges. Understanding the underlying ecological drivers of bear responses to climate variability and change, and the implications for conflict, will be critical for maintaining human-bear coexistence in North America. We synthesized 120 articles that identified direct and indirect mechanisms by which climate variability and change affect brown bears (Ursus arctos) and American black bears (Ursus americanus) in North America. The literature focused on examining climate impacts on bear diet, body size, habitat selection, space use, activity, denning chronology, and population demographics and dynamics. Across these categories, we summarized the documented and projected bear responses and resulting implications for human-bear interactions. Climate-driven changes in natural food availability were frequently implicated in influencing bear behavior and demography, and creating conditions under which interactions with humans are likely to increase. Bears in North America may face increased challenges as habitat and natural food availability continue to be altered by climate change. Our review provides a foundation upon which to identify climate drivers of bear ecology, conditions conducive to human-bear interactions, and adaptive management strategies. Given substantial evidence of climate impacts to bears, incorporating climate considerations into bear management can help managers strategically allocate resources and promote human-bear coexistence.",2024,"MAR","Biological Conservation","291","","","WOS:001187659800001","10.1016/j.biocon.2024.110500","","#6605","Kurth 2024","","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"37","Analysis of the Effect of Climate Warming on Paludification Processes: Will Soil Conditions Limit the Adaptation of Northern Boreal Forests to Climate Change? A Synthesis","Laamrani, A.; Valeria, O.; Chehbouni, A.; Bergeron, Y.","Northern boreal forests are characterized by accumulation of accumulation of peat (e.g., known as paludification). The functioning of northern boreal forest species and their capacity to adapt to environmental changes appear to depend on soil conditions. Climate warming is expected to have particularly pronounced effects on paludified boreal ecosystems and can alter current forest species composition and adaptation by changing soil conditions such as moisture, temperature regimes, and soil respiration. In this paper, we review and synthesize results from various reported studies (i.e., 88 research articles cited hereafter) to assess the effects of climatic warming on soil conditions of paludified forests in North America. Predictions that global warming may increase the decomposition rate must be considered in combination with its impact on soil moisture, which appears to be a limiting factor. Local adaptation or acclimation to current climatic conditions is occurring in boreal forests, which is likely to be important for continued ecosystem stability in the context of climate change. The most commonly cited response of boreal forest species to global warming is a northward migration that tracks the climate and soil conditions (e.g., temperature and moisture) to which they are adapted. Yet, some constraints may influence this kind of adaptation, such as water availability, changes in fire regimes, decomposer adaptations, and the dynamic of peat accumulation. In this paper, as a study case, we examined an example of potential effects of climatic warming on future paludification changes in the eastern lowland region of Canada through three different combined hypothetical scenarios based on temperature and precipitation (e.g., unchanged, increase, or decrease). An increase scenario in precipitation will likely favor peat accumulation in boreal forest stands prone to paludification and facilitate forested peatland expansion into upland forest, while decreased or unchanged precipitation combined with an increase in temperature will probably favor succession of forested peatlands to upland boreal forests. Each of the three scenarios were discussed in this study, and consequent silvicultural treatment options were suggested for each scenario to cope with anticipated soil and species changes in the boreal forests. We concluded that, despite the fact boreal soils will not constrain adaptation of boreal forests, some consequences of climatic warming may reduce the ability of certain species to respond to natural disturbances such as pest and disease outbreaks, and extreme weather events.",2020,"NOV","Forests","11","11","","WOS:000593215700001","10.3390/f11111176","","#6637","Laamrani 2020","","Biophysical; Biotic; Intervention; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

A.; Sumaila, U. R.","Tropical fisheries substantially contribute to the well-being of societies in both the tropics and the extratropics, the latter through 'telecoupling' - linkages between distant human-natural systems. Tropical marine habitats and fish stocks, however, are vulnerable to the physical and biogeochemical oceanic changes associated with rising greenhouse gases. These changes to fish stocks, and subsequent impacts on fish production, have substantial implications for the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In this Review, we synthesize the effects of climate change on tropical marine fisheries, highlighting the socio-economic impacts to both tropical and extratropical nations, and discuss potential adaptation measures. Driven by ocean warming, acidification, deoxygenation and sea-level rise, the maximum catch potential of tropical fish stocks in some tropical exclusive economic zones is projected to decline by up to 40% by the 2050s under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario, relative to the 2000s. Climate-driven reductions in fisheries production and alterations in fish-species composition will subsequently increase the vulnerability of tropical countries with limited adaptive capacity. Thus, given the billions of people dependent on tropical marine fisheries in some capacity, there is a clear need to account for the effects of climate change on these resources and identify practical adaptations when building climate-resilient sustainable-development pathways. Stressors arising from anthropogenic climate change threaten tropical fisheries and, in turn, those extratropical nations reliant on them.

G.; Ponte, R. M.; Thomas, M. D.","Scientific and societal interest in the relationship between the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and U.S. East Coast sea level has intensified over the past decade, largely due to (1) projected, and potentially ongoing, enhancement of sea level rise associated with AMOC weakening and (2) the potential for observations of U.S. East Coast sea level to inform reconstructions of North Atlantic circulation and climate. These implications have inspired a wealth of model- and observation-based analyses. Here, we review this research, finding consistent support in numerical models for an antiphase relationship between AMOC strength and dynamic sea level. However, simulations exhibit substantial along-coast and intermodel differences in the amplitude of AMOC-associated dynamic sea level variability. Observational analyses focusing on shorter (generally less than decadal) timescales show robust relationships between some components of the North Atlantic large-scale circulation and coastal sea level variability, but the causal relationships between different observational metrics, AMOC, and sea level are often unclear. We highlight the importance of existing and future research seeking to understand relationships between AMOC and its component currents, the role of ageostrophic processes near the coast, and the interplay of local and remote forcing. Such research will help reconcile the results of different numerical simulations with each other and with observations, inform the physical origins of covariability, and reveal the sensitivity of scaling relationships to forcing, timescale, and model representation.

F.","As one of the five components of Earth's climatic system, the cryosphere has been undergoing rapid shrinking due to global warming. Studies on the formation, evolution, distribution and dynamics of cryospheric components and their interactions with the human system are of increasing importance to society. In recent decades, the mass loss of glaciers, including the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, has accelerated. The extent of sea ice and snow cover has been shrinking, and permafrost has been degrading. The main sustainable development goals in cryospheric regions have been impacted. The shrinking of the cryosphere results in sea-level rise, which is currently affecting, or is soon expected to affect, 17 coastal megacities and some small island countries. In East Asia, South Asia and North America, climate anomalies are closely related to the extent of Arctic sea ice and snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere. Increasing freshwater melting from the ice sheets and sea ice may be one reason for the slowdown in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation in the Arctic and Southern Oceans. The foundations of ports and infrastructure in the circum-Arctic permafrost regions suffer from the consequences of permafrost degradation. In high plateaus and mountainous regions, the cryosphere's shrinking has led to fluctuations in river runoff, caused water shortages and increased flooding risks in certain areas. These changes in cryospheric components have shown significant heterogeneity at different temporal and spatial scales.

Changes in temperature and precipitation, and resulting shifts in plant phenology, winter severity, drought and wildfire conditions, invasive species distribution and abundance, predation, and disease have the potential to directly or indirectly affect ungulates. However, ungulate responses to climate variability and change are not uniform and vary by species and geography. Here, we present a systematic map protocol aiming to describe the abundance and distribution of evidence on the effects of climate variability and change on ungulate life-histories, population dynamics, and migration in North America. This map will help to identify knowledge gaps and clusters of evidence, and can be used to inform future research directions and adaptive management strategies. Methods: We will catalogue evidence on how climate variability and change affect the life-histories, population dynamics, and migration patterns of the fifteen ungulate species native to North America. We will search both academic and grey literature, using academic journal databases and specialist websites. Articles will be screened for inclusion at the title/abstract and full-text levels, and data will be extracted from articles that pass the full-text review.

R.","Increasing temperatures, precipitation extremes, and other anthropogenic influences (pollutant deposition, increasing carbon dioxide) will influence future forest composition and productivity in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. This synthesis of empirical and modeling studies includes tree DNA evidence suggesting tree migrations since the last glaciation were much slower, at least under postglacial conditions, than is needed to keep up with current and future climate warming. Exceedances of US and Canadian ozone air quality standards are apparent and offset CO2-induced gains in biomass and predispose trees to other stresses. The deposition of nitrogen and sulfate in the northeastern United States changes forest nutrient availability and retention, reduces reproductive success and frost hardiness, causes physical damage to leaf surfaces, and alters performance of forest pests and diseases. These interacting stresses may increase future tree declines and ecosystem disturbances during transition to a warmer climate. Recent modeling work predicts warmer climates will increase suitable habitat (not necessarily actual distribution) for most tree species in the northeastern United States. Species whose habitat is declining in the northeastern United States currently occur in Canadian forests and may expand northward with warming. Paleoecological studies suggest local factors may interact with, even overwhelm, climatic effects, causing lags and thresholds leading to sudden large shifts in vegetation.",2009,"FEB","Canadian Journal of Forest Research","39","2","213-230","WOS:000265054300002","10.1139/X08-185","","#8354","Mohan 2009","","Biophysical",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"44","Evolution of hydrological and carbon cycles under a changing climate. Part III: global change impacts on landscape scale evapotranspiration","Mu, Q. Z.; Zhao, M. S.; Running, S. W.","Hydrological and carbon cycles are inherently coupled and play a pivotal role in the earth system. Water stress is one of the most limiting factors constraining vegetation productivity in both direct and indirect ways (mainly through nutrition cycling). In this article, we first reviewed the concepts of hydrological and carbon cycles and their interactions and then summarized recent advances in our understanding of how global climate change affects water stress, ecosystem carbon cycling, disturbances, and water use efficiency. A warming climate may continue to benefit plant growth in energy limited areas such as high latitudes and altitudes. However, over many water-limited regions of the world, a warming climate has led to a drying trend, posing negative effects on land carbon sink capability, as shown by reductions in vegetation growth and increases in ecosystem disturbances (wildfires, insect outbreaks, and tree mortality). Carbon cycle and water use efficiency have responded to climate change in different ways in different areas. Further integrating information from climate records, flux measurements at eddy flux towers, and observations from satellites will greatly advance our understanding of the hydrological and carbon cycles and their evolution. Advancement in our understanding of the evolution of hydrological and carbon cycles under the changing climate will help us to adapt and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change.

"45","Impacts of altered precipitation regimes on soil communities and biogeochemistry in arid and semi-arid ecosystems","Nielsen, U. N.; Ball, B. A.","Altered precipitation patterns resulting from climate change will have particularly significant consequences in water-limited ecosystems, such as arid to semi-arid ecosystems, where discontinuous inputs of water control biological processes. Given that these ecosystems cover more than a third of Earth's terrestrial surface, it is important to understand how they respond to such alterations. Altered water availability may impact both aboveground and belowground communities and the interactions between these, with potential impacts on ecosystem functioning; however, most studies to date have focused exclusively on vegetation responses to altered precipitation regimes. To synthesize our understanding of potential climate change impacts on dryland ecosystems, we present here a review of current literature that reports the effects of precipitation events and altered precipitation regimes on belowground biota and biogeochemical cycling. Increased precipitation generally increases microbial biomass and fungal:bacterial ratio. Few studies report responses to reduced precipitation but the effects likely counter those of increased precipitation. Altered precipitation regimes have also been found to alter microbial community composition but broader generalizations are difficult to make. Changes in event size and frequency influences invertebrate activity and density with cascading impacts on the soil food web, which will likely impact carbon and nutrient pools. The long-term implications for biogeochemical cycling are inconclusive but several studies suggest that increased aridity may cause decoupling of carbon and nutrient cycling. We propose a new conceptual framework that incorporates hierarchical biotic responses to individual precipitation events more explicitly, including moderation of microbial activity and biomass by invertebrate grazing, and use this framework to make some predictions on impacts of altered precipitation regimes in terms of event size and frequency as well as mean annual precipitation. While our understanding of dryland ecosystems is improving, there is still a great need for longer term in situ manipulations of precipitation regime to test our model.",2015,"APR","Global Change Biology","21","4","1407-1421","WOS:000351214100006","10.1111/gcb.12789","","#8874","Nielsen 2015","","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"46","The role of hydrochory in structuring riparian and wetland vegetation","Nilsson, C.; Brown, R. L.; Jansson, R.; Merritt, D. M.","Hydrochory, or the passive dispersal of organisms by water, is an important means of propagule transport, especially for plants. During recent years, knowledge about hydrochory and its ecological consequences has increased considerably and a substantial body of literature has been produced. Here, we review this literature and define the state of the art of the discipline. A substantial proportion of species growing in or near water have propagules (fruits, seeds or vegetative units) able to disperse by water, either floating, submerged in flowing water, or with the help of floating vessels. Hydrochory can enable plants to colonize sites out of reach with other dispersal vectors, but the timing of dispersal and mechanisms of establishment are important for successful establishment. At the population level, hydrochory may increase the effective size and longevity of populations, and control their spatial configuration. Hydrochory is also an important source of species colonizing recruitment-limited riparian and wetland communities, contributing to maintenance of community species richness. Dispersal by water may even influence community composition in different landscape elements, resulting in landscape-level patterns. Genetically, hydrochory may reduce spatial aggregation of genetically related individuals, lead to high gene flow among populations, and increase genetic diversity in populations receiving many propagules. Humans have impacted hydrochory in many ways. For example, dams affect hydrochory by reducing peak flows and hence dispersal capacity, altering the timing of dispersal, and by presenting physical barriers to dispersal, with consequences for riverine plant communities. Hydrochory has been inferred to be an important vector for the spread of many invasive species, but there is also the potential for enhancing ecosystem restoration by improving or restoring water dispersal pathways. Climate change may alter the role of hydrochory by modifying the hydrology of water-bodies as well as conditions for propagule release and plant colonization.",2010,"NOV","Biological Reviews","85","4","837-858","WOS:000282880900009","10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00129.x","","#8887","Nilsson 2010","","Biophysical; Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

N.; Levin, E. D.","Climate change induced by anthropogenic warming of the earth's atmosphere is a daunting problem. This review examines one of the consequences of climate change that has only recently attracted attention: namely, the effects of climate change on the environmental distribution and toxicity of chemical pollutants. A review was undertaken of the scientific literature (original research articles, reviews, government and intergovernmental reports) focusing on the interactions of toxicants with the environmental parameters, temperature, precipitation, and salinity, as altered by climate change. Three broad classes of chemical toxicants of global significance were the focus: air pollutants, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including some organochlorine pesticides, and other classes of pesticides. Generally, increases in temperature will enhance the toxicity of contaminants and increase concentrations of tropospheric ozone regionally, but will also likely increase rates of chemical degradation. While further research is needed, climate change coupled with air pollutant exposures may have potentially serious adverse consequences for human health in urban and polluted regions. Climate change producing alterations in: food webs, lipid dynamics. ice and snow melt, and organic carbon cycling could result in increased POP levels in water, soil, and biota. There is also compelling evidence that increasing temperatures could be deleterious to pollutant-exposed wildlife. For example, elevated water temperatures may alter the biotransformation of contaminants to more bioactive metabolites and impair homeostasis. The complex interactions between climate change and pollutants may be particularly problematic for species living at the edge of their physiological tolerance range where acclimation capacity may be limited. In addition to temperature increases, regional precipitation patterns are projected to be altered with climate change. Regions subject to decreases in precipitation may experience enhanced volatilization of POPs and pesticides to the atmosphere. Reduced precipitation will also increase air pollution in urbanized regions resulting in negative health effects, which may be exacerbated by temperature increases. Regions subject to increased precipitation will have lower levels of air pollution, but will likely experience enhanced surface deposition of airborne POPs and increased run-off of pesticides. Moreover, increases in the intensity and frequency of storm events linked to climate change could lead to more severe episodes of chemical contamination of water bodies and surrounding watersheds. Changes in salinity may affect aquatic organisms as an independent stressor as well as by altering the bioavailability and in some instances increasing the toxicity of chemicals. A paramount issue will be to identify species and populations especially vulnerable to climate-pollutant interactions, in the context of the many other physical, chemical, and biological stressors that will be altered with climate change. Moreover, it will be important to predict tipping points that might trigger or accelerate synergistic interactions between climate change and contaminant exposures, (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2009,"AUG","Environment International","35","6","971-986","WOS:000267415500020","10.1016/j.envint.2009.02.006","","#8955","Noyes 2009","","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"48","Resolving Future Arctic/Midlatitude Weather Connections","Overland, J. E.; Wang, M. Y.","Given ongoing large changes in the Arctic, high-latitude forcing is a new potential driver for sub-seasonal weather impacts at midlatitudes in coming decades. Such linkage research, however, is controversial. Some metrics find supporting evidence and others report no robust correlations. Model studies reach different conclusions. Case studies from particular historical months suggest potential connections. We propose that a difficulty in resolving the science is due to the inherent complexity and intermittent character of atmospheric dynamics, which serves as a variable causal bridge between changes in the Arctic and midlatitude weather. Linkages may be more favorable in one atmospheric jet stream pattern than another. Linkages are a two-step process: thermodynamic forcing, i.e. warm Arctic temperatures and loss of sea ice, is generally favorable in the last decade, but internal atmospheric dynamics, i.e. the jet stream location and strength, must also allow for a connection. Thus, in the last decade only a few possible linkage events are noted into and out of the Arctic; for examples 2006, 2016, and 2018 had warm Arctic Januaries, and 2010 and 2017 had cold eastern North American Decembers. Record large sea-ice-free areas and warm temperatures north of Alaska and over Baffin Bay helped to anchor the long wave atmospheric pattern, which in turn fed cold temperatures into the eastern US. Intra-seasonal and inter-annual intermittency explains low direct Arctic/midlatitude linkage correlations and large variability in model studies.

E.","Over the past several decades, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in inland natural water systems has been a popular research topic to a variety of scientific disciplines. Part of the attention has been due to observed changes in DOC concentrations in many of the water systems of the Northern Hemisphere. Shifts in DOC levels, and changes in its composition, are of concern due to its significance in aquatic ecosystem functioning and its potential and realized negative effects on waters that might be treated for drinking purposes. While it may not be possible to establish sound cause and effect relationships using a limited number of drivers, through long-term DOC monitoring studies and a variety of laboratory/field experiments, several explanations for increasing DOC trends have been proposed, including two key mechanisms: decreased atmospheric acid deposition and the increasing impact of climate change agents. The purpose of this review is three-fold: to outline frequently discussed conceptual mechanisms used to explain DOC increases (especially under a changing climate), to discuss the structure of DOC and the impact of higher levels of DOC on drinking water resources, and to provide renewed/sustained interest in DOC research that can encourage interdisciplinary collaboration. Understanding the cycling of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems into natural waters is necessary in the face of a variable and changing climate, as climate change-related mechanisms may become increasingly responsible for variations in the inputs of allochthonous DOC concentrations in water.",2014,"OCT","Water","6","10","2862-2897","WOS:000344358200002","10.3390/w6102862","","#9226","Pagano 2014","","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

F.; Forster, I.; Chopin, T.; Brewer-Dalton, K.; Moccia, R. D.; Flaherty, M.; Smith, C. T.; De Silva, S.","The heavy reliance of most global aquaculture on the ambient environment suggests inherent vulnerability to climate change effects. This review explores the potential effects of climate change stressors on aquaculture biology and resources needed to support decision-making for vulnerability assessment, planned adaptation, and strategic research development. Climate change-mediated physiochemical outcomes important to aquaculture include extreme weather, precipitation and surge-based flooding, water stress, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, saltwater intrusion, and changes to temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. Culture practices, environment, and region affect stressor exposure, and biological response between species or populations are not universal. Response to a climate change stressor will be a function of where changes occur relative to optimal ranges and tolerance limits of an organism's life stage and physiological processes; the average magnitude of the stressor over the production cycle; stressor rate of change; variation, frequency, duration, and magnitude of extremes; epigenetic expression, genetic strain, and variation within and between populations; health and nutrition; and simultaneous stressor occurrence. The effects of simultaneous stressors will frequently interact, but may not be fully additive or synergistic. Disease is a major aquaculture limiter, and climate change is expected to further affect plant and animal health through the host and/or infectious agents. Climate change may introduce further complexity to the aquaculture-wild fishery relationship, with over two-thirds of animal aquaculture production dependent on external feed inputs. Higher production costs could be an economic outcome of climate change for many aquaculture sectors. Some aquaculture practices may inadvertently reduce resiliency to climate change, such as a reduction of coastal vegetation, coastal ground-water pumping, and reduction of population variability in pursuit of consistent production traits.

However, these wildfires also pose a range of social, economic, and environmental risks, with growing concern regarding persistent effects on stream flow volume, seasonal timing of flow, water quality, aquatic ecosystem health, and downstream community drinking water treatment. Here, we present the outcomes of a comprehensive scoping review of post-fire hydrologic studies in high-latitude forests of North America (Canada and Alaska). Our objectives were to (1) create an inventory of studies on post-fire hydrologic effects on surface water; (2) analyze those studies in terms of watershed characteristics and the type and duration of hydrologic effects; (3) identify and evaluate the link between upstream hydrologic effects with hydrologic ecosystem services; and (4) propose a research agenda addressing the link between wildfire science and hydrologic ecosystem services. We screened 2935 peer-reviewed articles and selected 82 studies to include based on their relevance according to a systematic, multi-step selection process. Next, we classified the papers into five themes: (a) runoff volume and flow regimes, (b) erosion and sediment transport, (c) water chemistry, (d) hydromorphology, and (e) aquatic food webs. For each study, we documented location, fire regime, watershed characteristics, and ecosystem services. The annual number of published studies on post-fire hydrology in high-latitude forests and, in particular, those addressing hydrologic ecosystem services, has increased steadily in recent years. Descriptions of wildfire characteristics, watershed characteristics, and effects on hydrologic ecosystem services were highly variable across studies, hindering cross-study comparisons. Moreover, there were limited efforts to extend study results to implications for forest or water management decisions regarding ecosystem services from source watersheds. Most studies focused on fire impacts on aquatic habitats and water chemistry while services of direct concern to communities, such as drinking water, were rarely addressed.

The scientific and policy communities have acknowledged the need for a better understanding of the effects of flow alteration on fish productivity. We conducted a systematic map to provide an overview of the existing literature base on the effects of flow-regime changes on direct outcomes of freshwater or estuarine fish productivity in temperate regions to inform stakeholders and policy makers. Methods To identify relevant articles for inclusion in this systematic map, we searched six bibliographic databases, 29 organizational websites, one search engine, and 297 reviews, and solicited grey literature through relevant sources. We screened articles at title and abstract, then by full-text using predefined inclusion criteria. Included studies were coded for key variables of interest, along with a very basic critical appraisal for internal validity (i.e., susceptibility to bias). The quantity and characteristics of the available evidence, knowledge gaps and subtopics with sufficient coverage for full systematic reviewing are reported in a narrative synthesis. The distribution and frequency of examined effects of flow-regime changes on fish productivity outcomes are presented in visual heatmaps. Review findings A total of 1368 studies from 1199 articles were included in the systematic map database and used to identify a number of interesting themes in the evidence base: (1) large evidence bases were found in temperate regions of United States of America (USA), Canada, and Australia; (2) most studies either used a temporal or spatial trend design i.e., lacking a 'true' before intervention time period, or no intervention control sites; (3) the most studied causes of altered flow regime were natural (e.g., floods, droughts, climate change), hydroelectric facilities (hydro), and dams with no hydro; and (4) there were clear clusters of studies evaluating effects of changes in magnitude and surrogate measures (e.g., velocity, water depth) on fish productivity outcomes, in particular abundance and diversity metrics. A number of potential knowledge gaps were identified: including geographic (Northern Africa, and possibly parts of Asia), causes of altered flow regime (restoration, land-use change, and water abstraction/extraction/diversion), interventions (flow duration, frequency, rate of change, or timing), outcomes (population viability) and specific intervention/cause/outcome groups (e.g., changes in flow magnitude due to hydro or natural causes and fish survival, performance, and reproduction). A few aspects in methodology were also identified across studies, primarily a lack of true comparators (e.g., temporal or spatial trend designs). Conclusions This map suggests subtopics warranting future evidence synthesis include, examinations into how changes in flow magnitude affects: (1) fish abundance for dams with no hydro causes; (2) fish abundance, diversity/richness, migration, and growth for hydro causes; and (3) fish abundance, diversity/richness, growth, community structure, recruitment, and migrating fish abundance for natural causes. More comprehensive evidence is needed to understand how: (1) fish productivity metrics are affected by changes in flow regime due to restoration, land-use change, and water withdrawal/diversion activities; (2) how fish productivity is affected by changes to components of flow regime other than magnitude (e.g. , flow duration, frequency); and (3) changes in flow magnitude due to hydro or natural causes affect fish survival, performance, and reproduction; and (4) changes in flow regime (all causes, all interventions) affect population viability.",2020,"APR 18","Environmental Evidence","9","1","","WOS:000529040200001","10.1186/s13750-020-00190-z","","#10527","Rytwinski 2020","","Biophysical",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"57","Impact of anthropogenous environmental factors on the marine ecosystem of trophically transmitted helminths and hosting seabirds: Focus on North Atlantic, North Sea, Baltic and the Arctic seas","Schwantes, U.","Alongside natural factors, human activities have a major impact on the marine environment and thus influence processes in vulnerable ecosystems. The major purpose of this review is to summarise the current understanding as to how manmade factors influence the marine biocenosis of helminths, their intermediate hosts as well as seabirds as their final hosts. Moreover, it highlights current knowledge gaps regarding this ecosystem, which should be closed in order to gain a more complete understanding of these interactions. This work is primarily focused on helminths parasitizing seabirds of the North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean.The complex life cycles of seabird helminths may be impacted by fishing and aquaculture, as they interfere with the abundance of fish and seabird species, while the latter also affects the geographical distribution of intermediate hosts (marine bivalve and fish species), and may therefore alter the intertwined marine ecosystem. Increasing temperatures and seawater acidification as well as environmental pollutants may have negative or positive effects on different parts of this interactive ecosystem and may entail shifts in the abundance or regional distribution of parasites and/or intermediate and final hosts. Organic pollutants and trace elements may weaken the immune system of the hosting seabirds and hence affect the final host's ability to control the endoparasites. On the other hand, in some cases helminths seem to function as a sink for trace elements resulting in decreased concentrations of heavy metals in birds' tissues. Furthermore, this article also describes the role of helminths in mass mortality events amongst seabird populations, which beside natural causes (weather, viral and bacterial infections) have anthropogenous origin as well (e.g. oil spills, climate change, overfishing and environmental pollution).",2023,"DEC 1","HELMINTHOLOGIA","60","4","300-326","WOS:001142875800010","10.2478/helm-2023-0034","","#10916","Schwantes 2023","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-09-02 22:22:33)(Select): reasonable transboundary assumption with inclusion of North Atlantic and Arctic seas ;","Biophysical",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Our synthesis is based on an analysis of projected temperature, precipitation, and snowfall stratified by eight biogeoclimatic provinces and three vegetation zones. Five IPCC CMIP5 global climate models (GCMs) and two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are the basis for projections of mean annual temperature increasing from a current average (1961-1990) of 3.2 A degrees C to 4.9-6.9 A degrees C (5 GCM range; RCP4.5 scenario) or 6.4-8.7 A degrees C (RCP8.5), mean annual precipitation increasing from 3130 mm to 3210-3400 mm (3-9 % increase) or 3320-3690 mm (6-18 % increase), and total precipitation as snow decreasing from 1200 mm to 940-720 mm (22-40 % decrease) or 720-500 mm (40-58 % decrease) by the 2080s (2071-2100; 30-year normal period). These projected changes are anticipated to result in a cascade of ecosystem-level effects including: increased frequency of flooding and rain-on-snow events; an elevated snowline and reduced snowpack; changes in the timing and magnitude of stream flow, freshwater thermal regimes, and riverine nutrient exports; shrinking alpine habitats; altitudinal and latitudinal expansion of lowland and subalpine forest types; shifts in suitable habitat boundaries for vegetation and wildlife communities; adverse effects on species with rare ecological niches or limited dispersibility; and shifts in anadromous salmon distribution and productivity.

These variations drive temporally and spatially averaged exchanges of heat, momentum, and water vapor that ultimately determine growth, recruitment, and migration patterns.

"60","Impacts of Beech Bark Disease and Climate Change on American Beech","Stephanson, C. A.; Coe, N. R.","American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) is a dominant component of forest tree cover over a large portion of eastern North America and this deciduous, mast-bearing tree species plays a key role in these forest ecosystems. Beech bark disease (BBD) is a scale insect-fungus complex that has caused the decline and death of afflicted beech trees. This disease has become a common feature in North American forest landscapes. Resistance to BBD is at the level of the beech scale (Cryptococcus fagisuga Lind.). Beech scale attack predisposes the tree to subsequent infection by Neonectria fungi. The impact of this tree disease has been shown to be significant, particularly in beech dominated forests. Scale-free trees (resistant to BBD) have been reported to range from only 1% to 3% in infested stands, with estimates ranging from 80-95% for overall infestation (for all beech within the current North American range). In addition to BBD, overall beech health will be directly impacted by climate change, if one specifically considers the expected fluctuations in precipitation leading to both drought periods and flooding. Beech is particularly sensitive to both extremes and is less resilient than other broad leaf tree species. Although the increase in global temperatures will likely shift the current range of the American beech, milder winters and less snowpack will favor propagation and survival of the beech scale. This review aims to present the current outlook for American beech in light of climate change. The natural history of the American beech and the onslaught of BBD during the last century will be covered, followed by the potential effects of a changing climate on BBD-infested forests. Evidence from models of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and other host-pathogen systems will supplement data directly gathered to evaluate BBD in American beech. We present the case that although climate change is likely to be a confounding factor in the continued loss of American beech, increasing our understanding of possible mechanisms of resistance and environmental factors that may influence susceptibility of American beech to BBD can inform proactive management strategies.",2017,"MAY","Forests","8","5","","WOS:000404099300017","10.3390/f8050155","","#11668","Stephanson 2017","","Biophysical; Biotic",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

X.; Kirkman, K.; Ochoa-Hueso, R.","Grasslands are globally-important ecosystems providing critical ecosystem services. The species composition and characteristics of grasslands vary considerably across the planet with a wide variety of different grasslands found. However, in many regions grasslands have been impacted by atmospheric nitrogen deposition originating from anthropogenic activities with effects on productivity, species composition and diversity widely reported. Impacts vary across grassland habitats but many show declines in species richness and increases in biomass production related to soil eutrophication and acidification. At a continental level, there is considerable variation in the research effort that has been put into understanding the impacts of nitrogen deposition. In Europe, North America and parts of Asia, although there are unanswered research questions, there is a good understanding of N deposition impacts in most grassland habitats. This is not the case in other regions with large knowledge gaps in some parts of the world.

D.","The Colorado River basin (CRB), the primary water source for southwestern North America, is divided into the 283,384 km(2), water-exporting Upper CRB (UCRB) in the Colorado Plateau geologic province, and the 344,440 km(2), water-receiving Lower CRB (LCRB) in the Basin and Range geologic province. Long-regarded as a snowmelt-fed river system, approximately half of the river's baseflow is derived from groundwater, much of it through springs. CRB springs are important for biota, culture, and the economy, but are highly threatened by a wide array of anthropogenic factors. We used existing literature, available databases, and field data to synthesize information on the distribution, ecohydrology, biodiversity, status, and potential socio-economic impacts of 20,872 reported CRB springs in relation to permanent stream distribution, human population growth, and climate change. CRB springs are patchily distributed, with highest density in montane and cliff-dominated landscapes. Mapping data quality is highly variable and many springs remain undocumented. Most CRB springs-influenced habitats are small, with a highly variable mean area of 2200 m(2), generating an estimated total springs habitat area of 45.4 km(2) (0.007% of the total CRB land area). Median discharge also is generally low and variable (0.10 L/s, N = 1687, 95% CI = 0.04 L/s), but ranges up to 1800 L/s. Water pH and conductivity is negatively related to elevation, with a stronger negative relationship in the UCRB compared to the LCRB. Natural springs water temperature and geochemistry throughout the CRB varies greatly among springs, but relatively little within springs, and depends on aquifer hydrogeology, elevation, and residence time. As the only state nearly entirely included within the CRB, Arizona is about equally divided between the two geologic provinces. Arizona springs produce approximately 0.6 km(3)/year of water. Data on >330 CRB springs-dependent taxa (SDT) revealed at least 62 plant species; 216 aquatic and riparian Mollusca, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, and other invertebrate taxa; several herpetofanual species; and two-thirds of 35 CRB fish taxa. Springs vegetation structure, composition, and diversity vary strongly by springs type, and plant species density within springs is high in comparison with upland habitats. Plant species richness and density is negatively related to elevation below 2500 m. Human population in and adjacent to the CRB are growing rapidly, and ecological impairment of springs exceeds 70% in many landscapes, particularly in urbanized and rangeland areas. Anthropogenic stressors are primarily related to groundwater depletion and pollution, livestock management, flow abstraction, non-native species introduction, and recreation. Ensuring the ecological integrity and sustainability of CRB groundwater supplies and springs will require more thorough basic inventory, assessment, research, information management, and local ecosystem rehabilitation, as well as improved groundwater and springs conservation policy.",2020,"MAY","Water","12","5","","WOS:000555915200280","10.3390/w12051501","","#11681","Stevens 2020","","Biophysical",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"63","Natural disturbances as drivers of tipping points in forest ecosystems under climate change - implications for adaptive management","Thom, D.","As climate continues to change, disturbances may increasingly navigate forest ecosystems towards tipping points, causing irreversible state shifts and a loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. In this review, I elaborate the Special Issue topic 'Natural disturbances as tipping points of forest ecosystems under climate change' featured by Forestry and suggest a suit of adaptive measures to mitigate increasing disturbances and their impacts on forest ecosystems. The Special Issue contains seven case studies assessing drought, fire, wind and bark beetle disturbances in Europe, North America and Africa. Despite high severities and/or frequencies, disturbances have not yet induced a shift of the investigated forest ecosystems towards an alternative state. Instead, forests have shown high resistance, resilience or both. For instance, one case study reveals that short-interval fires in European beech forests may not even significantly alter tree species composition due to the high resprouting ability of beech. Yet, other case studies identify distinct differences in resilience amongst ecoregions, and indicate that climate change and disturbance interactions might tip the future carbon balance of forests from sink to source. Many forest ecosystems are likely able to cope with future increases in disturbance activity to some degree. However, tipping points might vary across ecosystems dominated by different disturbance agents. While wind and bark beetles mainly affect canopy trees, fire and drought also directly impair tree regeneration, thus reducing the capacity of ecosystems to recover and reorganize. Hence, forest ecosystems in which fire and drought are the dominant disturbance agents might approach tipping points earlier than forests dominated by other agents if disturbance activity continues to increase. Several proactive and reactive adaptive measures are available to mitigate increasing disturbances, but more research is needed to develop robust and region-specific strategies to prevent tipping points in forest ecosystems.",2023,"MAY 5","FORESTRY","96","3","305-315","WOS:000949155300001","10.1093/forestry/cpad011","","#12087","Thom 2023","","Biophysical; Biotic; Perspective paper; Potentially relevant; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

D.; Popova, V.; Deser, C.; Holland, M.; Prowse, T.","Atmospheric humidity, clouds, precipitation, and evapotranspiration are essential components of the Arctic climate system. During recent decades, specific humidity and precipitation have generally increased in the Arctic, but changes in evapotranspiration are poorly known. Trends in clouds vary depending on the region and season. Climate model experiments suggest that increases in precipitation are related to global warming. In turn, feedbacks associated with the increase in atmospheric moisture and decrease in sea ice and snow cover have contributed to the Arctic amplification of global warming. Climate models have captured the overall wetting trend but have limited success in reproducing regional details. For the rest of the 21st century, climate models project strong warming and increasing precipitation, but different models yield different results for changes in cloud cover. The model differences are largest in months of minimum sea ice cover. Evapotranspiration is projected to increase in winter but in summer to decrease over the oceans and increase over land. Increasing net precipitation increases river discharge to the Arctic Ocean. Over sea ice in summer, projected increase in rain and decrease in snowfall decrease the surface albedo and, hence, further amplify snow/ice surface melt. With reducing sea ice, wind forcing on the Arctic Ocean increases with impacts on ocean currents and freshwater transport out of the Arctic. Improvements in observations, process understanding, and modeling capabilities are needed to better quantify the atmospheric role in the Arctic water cycle and its changes.",2016,"MAR","JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES","121","3","586-620","WOS:000374345000003","10.1002/2015JG003132","","#12638","Vihma 2016","","Biophysical",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

There is increasing recognition that observed and projected changes in freshwater sources, fluxes, and storage will have profound implications for the physical, biogeochemical, biological, and ecological processes and properties of Arctic terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. However, a significant level of uncertainty remains in relation to forecasting the impacts of an intensified hydrological regime and related cryospheric change on ecosystem structure and function. As the terrestrial and freshwater ecology component of the Arctic Freshwater Synthesis, we review these uncertainties and recommend enhanced coordinated circumpolar research and monitoring efforts to improve quantification and prediction of how an altered hydrological regime influences local, regional, and circumpolar-level responses in terrestrial and freshwater systems. Specifically, we evaluate (i) changes in ecosystem productivity; (ii) alterations in ecosystem-level biogeochemical cycling and chemical transport; (iii) altered landscapes, successional trajectories, and creation of new habitats; (iv) altered seasonality and phenological mismatches; and (v) gains or losses of species and associated trophic interactions. We emphasize the need for developing a process-based understanding of interecosystem interactions, along with improved predictive models.

X.; Wang, F. Y.; Feng, X. B.","Mercury (Hg) is a toxic metal that can be released from natural and anthropogenic processes. Gaseous elemental Hg is the main form of Hg in the atmosphere with a long residence time, allowing its long-range transport and deposition at a global scale. The deposited Hg can be transformed into methylmercuy (MeHg), which bioaccumulates and biomagnifies in aquatic ecosystems and is a known developmental neurotoxin to humans. Chronic exposure in pregnant women via fish consumption, even at the modest levels, can impact intellectual development in infants, which is considered as a global environmental health issue. To protect human health and the environment, the Minamata Convention on Mercury, a legally binding international treaty, entered into force in 2017 to reduce anthropogenic emissions and releases of Hg and Hg compounds. With the enforcement of the Convention, anthropogenic Hg emissions and releases are projected to decrease in the foreseeable future, but the recovery of the ecosystem and mitigation of health impact from Hg pollution are expected to lag behind. In this paper, we provide a critical review on the processes affecting when and to which extent Hg-affected ecosystems will recover under the Minamata Convention in the context of climate change and associated human health benefit. Our review is organized around seven major scientific questions. These seven questions covered historical Hg change in the ecosystem, major factors and processes, and future assessment. The impact of implementation of Minamata Convention and climate change on Hg emission, atmospheric transportation and deposition, biota accumulation, and human exposure should be comprehensively evaluated. The Hg stable isotope tool and process-based integrated global model should be integrated together, which also should consider future global social-economic pathways and mitigation options. We hope that the knowledge gaps and potential tools identified will assist the understanding of global biogeochemical cycling of Hg, inform policy-making on mitigation and community adaptation, and support the effectiveness evaluation and future improvement of the Minamata Convention on Mercury.",2022,"DEC","REVIEWS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY","260","1","","WOS:000895940100001","10.1007/s44169-022-00016-8","","#13335","Wu 2022","Elliott Parsons (2024-08-17 06:58:48)(Select): This article is not available through my University library so I cannot access it;","Biophysical; Biotic",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

This review thus examined about 312 watersheds worldwide to provide a generalized framework to evaluate hydrological responses to forest cover change and to identify the contribution of spatial scale, climate, forest type and hydrological regime in determining the intensity of forest change related hydrological responses in small (<1000 km(2)) and large watersheds ( >= 1000 km(2)). Key findings include: (1) the increase in annual runoff associated with forest cover loss is statistically significant at multiple spatial scales whereas the effect of forest cover gain is statistically inconsistent; (2) the sensitivity of annual runoff to forest cover change tends to attenuate as watershed size increases only in large watersheds; (3) annual runoff is more sensitive to forest cover change in water-limited watersheds than in energy-limited watersheds across all spatial scales; and (4) small mixed forest-dominated watersheds or large snow-dominated watersheds are more hydrologically resilient to forest cover change. These findings improve the understanding of hydrological response to forest cover change at different spatial scales and provide a scientific underpinning to future watershed management in the context of climate change and increasing anthropogenic disturbances.

PCBs in the Arctic have shown declining trends in the environment over the last few decades. Atmospheric long-range transport from secondary and primary sources is the major input of PCBs to the Arctic region. Modelling of the atmospheric PCB composition and behaviour showed some increases in environmental concentrations in a warmer Arctic, but the general decline in PCB levels is still the most prominent feature. 'Within-Arctic' processing of PCBs will be affected by climate change-related processes such as changing wet deposition. These in turn will influence biological exposure and uptake of PCBs. The pan-Arctic rivers draining large Arctic/sub-Arctic catchments provide a significant source of PCBs to the Arctic Ocean, although changes in hydrology/sediment transport combined with a changing marine environment remain areas of uncertainty with regard to PCB fate.

The goal is to document how different attributes of water quality are sensitive to these drivers, to characterize future risk, to inform management responses, and to identify research needs to fill gaps in our understanding. Results suggest that anticipated future changes present a risk of water quality and ecosystem degradation in many United States locations. Understanding responses is, however, complicated by inherent high spatial and temporal variability, interactions with land use and water management, and dependence on uncertain changes in hydrology in response to future climate. Effects on pollutant loading in different watershed settings generally correlate with projected changes in precipitation and runoff. In all regions, increased heavy precipitation events are likely to drive more episodic pollutant loading to water bodies. The risk of algal blooms could increase due to an expanded seasonal window of warm water temperatures and the potential for episodic increases in nutrient loading. Increased air and water temperatures are also likely to affect the survival of waterborne pathogens.

A.","As a headwaters region, Colorado is a critical source of water for surrounding states and Mexico. But fuel densification and shifts in hydrometeorological processes, such as climate aridification and precipitation sharpening, are causing increasingly severe and erratic wildfire behavior and post-disturbance geomorphic hazards in and downstream of its forested source water areas. Human development patterns and inter and intra-state water rights agreements further complicate resource management. This is prompting land managers to consider progressive planning and management tools to mitigate fire-related degradation of water supply and irrigation systems. This narrative review examines aspects of Colorado's geography, demography, and hydrology that make its water supply systems and transfer agreements particularly vulnerable to landscape disturbance and then provides hazard mitigation recommendations. Readers are introduced to Colorado's water supply portfolio including how water is moved, stored, treated, and consumed; why those systems are vulnerable to wildfire disturbance; and how risk can be reduced before and after fires occur. Lessons learned are applicable to other source water areas facing similar challenges. By synthesizing our review findings, we identified numerous research and programmatic gaps including the need for more interdisciplinary studies; a lack of explicit research into how disturbance-driven hydromodification may hinder the ability of headwater regions to exercise their water rights and fulfill water transfer agreements (crucial for reducing potential future water conflict); an unresolved debate regarding the potential effects of forest treatments on water yield; and the need for additional funding to roll out tools and educational programs to communities experiencing severe wildfire activity for the first time.",2023,"","Journal of Environmental Management","339","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117956","","#17435","Collar 2023","","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This study synthesizes existing research associated with the potential effects of a changing climate on the quality and quantity of groundwater in the Great Lakes Basin. It includes analyses of impacts on (1) recharge, (2) groundwater storage, (3) discharge and groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions, (4) exacerbating future urban development impacts on groundwater, (5) groundwater quality, and (6) ecohydrology. Large spatial and temporal (i.e., seasonal) variability in groundwater response to climate change between regions is anticipated. Most studies combine field observations with modelling, but many have focused only on small/medium basins. At these small scales, groundwater systems are generally projected to be fairly resilient to climate change impacts. However, modelling studies of larger basins (e.g., Grand River, Saginaw Bay, Maumee River) predict an increase in groundwater storage. Uncertainty in model simulations, particularly from climate models that are used to force hydrological models, is a major challenge.

"78","A summary of the effects of climate change on Ontario's aquatic ecosystems","Dove-Thompson, D.; Lewis, C.; Gray, P. A.; Chu, C.; Dunlop, W. I.","Climate change will alter Ontario's aquatic ecosystems as a result of increases in air and water temperature, decreases in ice and snow cover, and changes in the timing and amount of precipitation. These changes will affect the hydrological cycle by altering the flow of water and water chemistry. Threats to freshwater fauna include nutrient enrichment, hydrological modifications, habitat degradation and loss, pollution, and the spread of invasive species. A changing climate and increasing levels of ultraviolet light pose additional risks that add to existing threats. The combination of changes in land use, habitat, and climate present a serious challenge to the long-term integrity and health of aquatic ecosystems. Since fish are cold-blooded, increases in water temperature will affect their distribution, growth, reproduction, and survival. The habitat and productivity for coldwater species, such as lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), may decline substantially with increased air and water temperatures. Coolwater fishes likely will respond to climate change in a variety of ways. For example, in the case of walleye (Sander vitreus) in central and northern Ontario, warming may increase available habitat. Overall, model projections suggest a northward shift in the location of the walleye fishery. Many warmwater fishes are projected to benefit from warmer water temperatures. For example, smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), which reach the northern extent of their range in Ontario, may expand northward as warmer water temperatures facilitate increased growth and recruitment. A northward expansion of warmwater fish species will disrupt the life history strategies of cool- and coldwater fish species. Commercial and recreational harvest opportunities for lake trout, brook trout, and perhaps walleye will decline, particularly in southern Ontario. Although these losses may be offset somewhat by increased opportunities to harvest warmwater species, the expected changes in fish communities will bring a variety of social and economic challenges. To meet these challenges, an adaptive approach to fisheries and aquatic ecosystem management in Ontario is needed. Known and potential climate change effects must be incorporated into existing fisheries management plans and strategic plans will need to be revisited to ensure that they reflect anticipated changes. Given the importance of understanding the range of potential climate change effects on aquatic assets, it is essential that management agencies and organizations identify and apply appropriate effective mitigation and adaptive management strategies. This report reviews and summarizes the known and potential effects of climate change on Ontario's aquatic ecosystems and on the life history of selected coldwater, coolwater, and warmwater fish species.",2011,"","Climate Change Research Report - Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry","","CCRR-11","iii-pp","","","","#17895","Dove-Thompson 2011","","Biophysical; Biotic",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

G.","This paper identifies and characterizes current knowledge on climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability for Canada's northern coastline, outlining key research gaps. Warming temperatures and increased precipitation have been documented across the northern coast, with the rate of sea ice decline ranging from 2.9% to 10.4% per decade. Storm intensity and frequency is increasing, and permafrost is warming across the region. Many of these changes are projected to accelerate in the future, with in excess of 8 degrees C warming in winter possible under a high-emission scenario by 2081-2100. Vulnerability to these changes differs by region and community, a function of geographic location, nature of climate change impacts, and human factors. Capacity to manage climate change is high in some sectors, such as subsistence harvesting, but is being undermined by long-term societal changes. In other sectors, such as infrastructure and transportation, limitations in climate risk management capacity result in continuing high vulnerabilities. There is evidence that adaptation is taking place in response to experienced and projected impacts, although readiness for adaptation is challenged by limited resources, institutional capacity, and a need for support for adaptation across levels of government. Priority areas for future research include (i) expanding the sectoral and geographic focus of understanding on climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability; (ii) integrating climatic and socio-economic projections into vulnerability and adaptation assessments; (iii) developing an evidence base on adaptation options; and (iv) monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of adaptation support.

Scientists and managers reviewed current climate change science and identified resources vulnerable to expected climate change. Vulnerabilities related to vegetation and habitat management included potential reductions in forest biodiversity and low forest resilience to changing disturbance regimes. The vulnerabilities related to aquatic and infrastructure resources included changing water quality and quantity, the risk to roads and other facilities from changes to hydrologic regimes, and the potential loss of at-risk aquatic species and habitats. Managers then worked in facilitated groups to identify adaptations that could be implemented through management and planning to reduce the vulnerability of key resources to climate change.

Data on fish tissue mercury concentrations collected by state, tribal, and provincial governments via contaminant monitoring programs have been compiled into large data bases by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Great Lakes National Monitoring Program Office (GLNPO), the Ontario Ministry of the Environment's Fish Contaminants Monitoring and Surveillance Program (FMSP), and many others. These data have been used by a wide range of governmental and academic investigators worldwide to examine long-term and recent trends in fish tissue mercury concentrations. The largest component of the trend literature is for North American freshwater species important in recreational fisheries. This review of temporal trends in fish tissue mercury concentrations focused on published results from freshwater fisheries of North America as well as marine fisheries worldwide. Trends in fish tissue mercury concentrations in North American lakes with marked overall decreases were reported over the period 1972-2016. These trends are consistent with reported mercury emission declines as well as trends in wet deposition across the U.S. and Canada. More recently, a leveling-off in the rate of decreases or increases in fish tissue mercury concentrations has been reported. Increased emissions of mercury from global sources beginning between 1990 and 1995, despite a decrease in North American emissions, have been advanced as an explanation for the observed changes in fish tissue trends. In addition to increased atmospheric deposition, the other factors identified to explain the observed mercury increases in the affected fish species include a systematic shift in the food-web structure with the introduction of non-native species, creating a new or expanding role for sediments as a net source for mercury. The influences of climate change have also been identified as contributing factors, including considerations such as increases in temperature (resulting in metabolic changes and higher uptake rates of methylmercury), increased rainfall intensity and runoff (hydrologic export of organic matter carrying HgII from watersheds to surface water), and water level fluctuations that alter either the methylation of mercury or the mobilization of monomethylmercury. The primary source of mercury exposure in the human diet in North America is from the commercial fish and seafood market which is dominated (>90%) by marine species. However, very little information is available on mercury trends in marine fisheries. Most of the data used in the published marine trend studies are assembled from earlier reports. The data collection efforts are generally intermittent, and the spatial and fish-size distribution of the target species vary widely. As a result, convincing evidence for the existence of fish tissue mercury trends in marine fish is generally lacking. However, there is some evidence from sampling of large, long-lived commercially-important fish showing both lower mercury concentrations in the North Atlantic in response to reduced anthropogenic mercury emission rates in North America and increases in fish tissue mercury concentrations over time in the North Pacific in response to increased mercury loading.",2019,"","Special Issue: Mercury in the environment of New York State.","29","10","1739-1749","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-019-02112-3","","#18773","Grieb 2019","Colleen Miller (2024-09-04 04:22:32)(Select): """"The potential effect of climate change on the changing trends in fish tissue concentrations was noted by almost all the authors.

W.","This synthesis provides an ecological foundation for management of the diverse ecosystems and fire regimes of North America, based on scientific principles of fire interactions with vegetation, fuels, and biophysical processes. Although a large amount of scientific data on fire exists, most of those data have been collected at small spatial and temporal scales. Thus, it is challenging to develop consistent science-based plans for large spatial and temporal scales where most fire management and planning occur. Understanding the regional geographic context of fire regimes is critical for developing appropriate and sustainable management strategies and policy. The degree to which human intervention has modified fire frequency, intensity, and severity varies greatly among different ecosystems, and must be considered when planning to alter fuel loads or implement restorative treatments. Detailed discussion of six ecosystems - ponderosa pine forest (western North America), chaparral (California), boreal forest (Alaska and Canada), Great Basin sagebrush (intermountain West), pine and pine-hardwood forests (Southern Appalachian Mountains), and longleaf pine (Southeastern United States) - illustrates the complexity of fire regimes and that fire management requires a clear regional focus that recognizes where conflicts might exist between fire hazard reduction and resource needs. In some systems, such as ponderosa pine, treatments are usually compatible with both fuel reduction and resource needs, whereas in others, such as chaparral, the potential exists for conflicts that need to be closely evaluated.

S.","Mercury cycles at levels three- to five-fold higher today than the pre-Industrial era, resulting in global contamination of ecosystems. In the western United States (U.S.), mercury mobilization has led to widespread production of methylmercury (MeHg), a potent, bioaccumulating neurotoxin, which has resulted in fish consumption advisories across all states. Mountain regions are particularly sensitive to continued mercury contamination as they receive higher rates of atmospheric deposition, compared to lower elevations, and have aquatic ecosystems on the landscape conducive to MeHg production. In this paper, we focus on the U.S. Rocky Mountain region and synthesize: (1) current knowledge regarding the mercury cycle; (2) impacts of climate change on the mercury cycle connected to hydrology and wildfire; and (3) future research priorities for informing mercury research and regulation. Studies on the interactions between mercury contamination and climate change in mountain ecosystems is still nascent. We use the findings from this synthesis to summarize the following research needs: (1) quantify sources of mercury in wet and dry deposition, as these pathways dictate mercury exposure and toxicity, and are shifting with climate change; (2) investigate MeHg in mountain aquatic ecosystems, which are important pathways of human mercury exposure and provide food resources and habitat to local wildlife; and (3) examine the disproportionate impact of mercury contamination on indigenous communities through community-led research.

This retreat has been accompanied by statistically detectable declines in late-summer streamflow from glacier-fed catchments over much of the study area, although there is some geographical variation: over recent decades, glaciers in northwest BC and southwest Yukon have lost mass dominantly by thinning with relatively low rates of terminal retreat, and glacier-fed streams in that region have experienced increasing flows. In many valleys, glacier retreat has produced geomorphic hazards, including outburst floods from moraine-dammed lakes, mass failures from oversteepened valley walls and debris flows generated on moraines. In addition to these hydrologic and geomorphic changes, evidence is presented that glacier retreat will result in higher stream temperatures, possibly transient increases in suspended sediment fluxes and concentrations, and changes in water chemistry. With climate projected to continue warming over the twenty-first century, current trends in hydrology, geomorphology and water quality should continue, with a range of implications for water resources availability and management and hydroecology, particularly for cool and cold-water species such as salmonids.",2009,"","Special Review Issue: Hydrologic effects of a shrinking cryosphere.","23","1","42-61","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7162","","#21285","Moore 2009","","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

M.; Lal, R.; Wohl, E.; Fairfax, E.; Gellis, A. C.; Pollock, M. M.","In this article we describe the natural hydrogeomorphological and biogeochemical cycles of dryland fluvial ecosystems that make them unique, yet vulnerable to land use activities and climate change. We introduce Natural Infrastructure in Dryland Streams (NIDS), which are structures naturally or anthropogenically created from earth, wood, debris, or rock that can restore implicit function of these systems. This manuscript further discusses the capability of and functional similarities between beaver dams and anthropogenic NIDS, documented by decades of scientific study. In addition, we present the novel, evidence-based finding that NIDS can create wetlands in water-scarce riparian zones, with soil organic carbon stock as much as 200 to 1400 Mg C/ha in the top meter of soil. We identify the key restorative action of NIDS, which is to slow the drainage of water from the landscape such that more of it can infiltrate and be used to facilitate natural physical, chemical, and biological processes in fluvial environments. Specifically, we assert that the rapid drainage of water from such environments can be reversed through the restoration of natural infrastructure that once existed. We then explore how NIDS can be used to restore the natural biogeochemical feedback loops in these systems. We provide examples of how NIDS have been used to restore such feedback loops, the lessons learned from installation of NIDS in the dryland streams of the southwestern United States, how such efforts might be scaled up, and what the implications are for mitigating climate change effects.

Therefore, this review paper examined sustainable global water management by focussing on four sustainable development goal (SDG #6) indicators, including water use efficiency in agriculture, integrated water management, transboundary water cooperation, and water user participation. The review covered articles from 2016 to 2023, using Scopus and Web of Science databases with specific selection criteria. A total of 216 sources were downloaded, and after data screening, 72 articles were analysed along with additional supplementary materials such as books, conference papers, and United Nations documents. The finding indicates emerging trends in sustainable water management for agriculture, including water-efficient technologies like alternate wetting and drying, drip irrigation, mulching, etc. However, careful implementation is required to address environmental concerns, prevent water pollution, minimise yield reductions, and ensure long-term sustainability. Moreover, integrated water resource management has faced challenges in practical implementation due to governance structures, economic circumstances, cooperation, and collaboration among stakeholders. While over 600 treaties aim to promote international water cooperation, only a few have been effective. In addition, out of 500 transboundary groundwater sources shared by countries, only six have dedicated treaties to govern their use. Thus, clearly defined rights, responsibilities, and sustainable management practises for each shared aquifer would foster the sustainability of these resources.

A.","Clear Lake (Lake County, CA, USA) is hypereutrophic and used for drinking water, tribal use, and supports a significant fishing economy. The Mendocino Complex (2018), one of the largest wildfires in California's post-settlement history, burned 40% of the Clear Lake watershed, providing a timely opportunity to study the impacts of historical and current wildfires on this valuable aquatic resource. Using long-term monthly monitoring data from 1968 to 2019, paired with historical watershed fire data, we found that for the three largest fire years in the watershed's history, 3-year postfire median July-October epilimnetic total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were below or equal to 3-year prefire TP concentrations. However, both median TP epilimnetic concentrations and deepwater temperature across the lake have increased since the late 1960s. Long-term TP increases were more strongly correlated with monthly maximum air temperatures than precipitation, suggesting a potential role of warming-induced water column stratification, dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion, and high potential for internal phosphorus loading. Hypoxic occurrences were correlated with higher hypolimnetic soluble reactive phosphorus and TP concentrations, but additional high-frequency monitoring of DO will help determine the duration of anoxia and its contribution to internal phosphorus loading. These long-term data suggest that for this large, hypereutrophic lake, wildfires did not significantly alter in-lake TP concentrations based on long-term, monthly monitoring and that other internal or external sources of TP may mask any wildfire effects. Nonetheless, our study underscores the value of synthesizing decades of water quality, watershed wildfire, and climate data to build a more comprehensive, nuanced picture of multiple long-term threats to aquatic ecosystems under global change. Moreover, monitoring and studying fire effects across a wide range of lake types beyond this study will help promote more effective lake management during changing climates and increasingly frequent large wildfires.",2022,"","Ecosphere","13","12","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4271","","#21846","Palma-Dow 2022","Laura  Dee (2024-08-14 07:07:07)(Select): cross-boundary with tribe in Northern CA and discussions of human well being

J.; Hayes, F.","Restoration ecologists have local- to global-scale ambitions in a policy framework of sustainable development goals and reversing biodiversity loss. Emphasis is given to environmental alteration, typically considering land degradation and climate change. Other related environmental drivers, such as pollution, receive less attention. Here we emphasize that terrestrial restoration discourse needs to consider tropospheric ozone (O3) pollution. O3's pervasive influence on plants and other ecosystem components provides for the possibility of consequences at community and ecosystem levels. The precursor chemicals that lead to O3 formation are increasing, precipitously so in rapidly industrializing regions of the world. Yet, a review of critical restoration guidance and journals suggests that because O3 is out of sight, it remains out of mind. Based on a narrative cross-discipline literature review, we examine: (1) How O3 could affect the achievement of restoration goals and (2) How restoration interventions could feedback on tropospheric O3. Evidence, currently limited, suggests that O3 could impair the achievement of restoration goals to as great an extent as other drivers, but, in general, we lack direct quantification. Restoration interventions (e.g. tree planting) that may be considered successful can actually exacerbate O3 pollution with negative consequences for food security and human health. These wide-ranging effects, across multiple goals, mean that O3 is not out of scope for restoration science, policy, and practice. In detailing a strategic ozone-aware restoration agenda, we suggest how restoration science and policy can quantify O3's influence, while outlining steps practitioners can take to adapt to/mitigate the impacts of O3 pollution.",2022,"","Restoration Ecology","30","7","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.13622","","#22038","Perring 2022","","Biophysical",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

H.; Franklin, J. F.; McComb, B.; Riegel, G.","Forests characterized by mixed-severity fires occupy a broad moisture gradient between lower elevation forests typified by low-severity fires and higher elevation forests in which high-severity, stand replacing fires are the norm. Mixed-severity forest types are poorly documented and little understood but likely occupy significant areas in the western United States. By definition, mixed-severity types have high beta diversity at meso-scales, encompassing patches of both high and low severity and gradients in between. Studies of mixed-severity types reveal complex landscapes in which patch sizes follow a power law distribution with many small and few large patches. Forest types characterized by mixed severity can be classified according to the modal proportion of high to low severity patches, which increases from relatively dry to relatively mesic site conditions. Mixed-severity regimes are produced by interactions between top-down forcing by climate and bottom-up shaping by topography and the flammability of vegetation, although specific effects may vary widely across the region, especially the relation between aspect and fire severity. History is important in shaping fire behavior in mixed-severity landscapes, as patterns laid down by previous fires can play a significant role in shaping future fires. Like low-severity forests in the western United States, many dry mixed-severity types experienced significant increases in stand density during the 20th century, threatening forest health and biodiversity, however not all understory development in mixed-severity forests increases the threat of severe wild fires. In general, current landscapes have been homogenized, reducing beta diversity and increasing the probability of large fires and insect outbreaks. Further loss of old, fire tolerant trees is of particular concern, but understory diversity has been reduced as well. High stand densities on relatively dry sites increase water use and therefore susceptibility to drought and insect outbreaks, exacerbating a trend of increasing regional drying. The need to restore beta diversity while protecting habitat for closed-forest specialists such as the northern spotted owl call for landscape-level approaches to ecological restoration.",2011,"","Forest Ecology and Management","262","5","703-717","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2011.05.004","","#22039","Perry 2011","","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Robust indicators reflecting the effects of climate change on the US and global water cycles are needed in order to appropriately manage water resources. Here, we describe a suite of seventeen water cycle and management indicators, which are based on synthesis of available datasets. These indicators include average and heavy precipitation, standardized precipitation index, annual, 7-day low and 3-day high streamflow volume, streamflow timing, snow cover, snow water equivalent, groundwater level, lake water temperature, stream water temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, Palmer Drought Severity Index, water withdrawals, and water use. We also identify three indicators that could be included in the suite of water cycle and management indicators with some additional, directed work: snowfall, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture. Our conceptual framework focuses on known water cycle changes in addition to potential effects on management and addresses water quantity and quality, as well as water use and related interactions with freshwater ecosystems, societal impacts, and management. Water cycle indicators are organized into three categories: (1) hydrologic processes, (2) water quality processes, and (3) water quality and quantity impacts. Indicators described here are recommended to serve as critical references for periodic climate assessments. As such, these indicators support analyses of the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy, and water resources, among other sectors.

The scope of the synthesis was limited to the magnitude and timing of streamflow, stream temperature, suspended sediment, and aquatic invertebrate population dynamics. In general, the effects on hydrologic processes and watershed functions are greater following post-disturbance activities; climate change is anticipated to further negatively compound these natural disturbances. To maintain the resilience of watersheds (that is, the ability of natural systems to recover from perturbation), management activities should be designed to maintain natural hydrologic and ecosystem function wherever possible. Key considerations to maintain resilience include: planning management activities at the site, watershed and landscape scales, maximizing riparian overstory retention within 10 metres of streams, minimizing the introduction of fine sediments into surface water bodies, and monitoring the effects of disturbances and management interventions to support adaptive management.

D.","Both gradual and extreme weather changes trigger complex ecological responses in river ecosystems. It is still unclear to what extent trend or event effects alter biodiversity and functioning in river ecosystems, adding considerable uncertainty to predictions of their future dynamics. Using a comprehensive database of 71 published studies, we show that event - but not trend - effects associated with extreme changes in water flow and temperature substantially reduce species richness. Furthermore, event effects - particularly those affecting hydrological dynamics - on biodiversity and primary productivity were twice as high as impacts due to gradual changes. The synthesis of the available evidence reveals that event effects induce regime shifts in river ecosystems, particularly affecting organisms such as invertebrates. Among extreme weather events, dryness associated with flow interruption caused the largest effects on biota and ecosystem functions in rivers. Effects on ecosystem functions (primary production, organic matter decomposition and respiration) were asymmetric, with only primary production exhibiting a negative response to extreme weather events. Our meta-analysis highlights the disproportionate impact of event effects on river biodiversity and ecosystem functions, with implications for the long-term conservation and management of river ecosystems.

The National Assessment of Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change (NAST 2001) was based on a series of regional and sector assessments. This paper is a summary of the coastal and marine resources sector review of potential impacts on shorelines, estuaries, coastal wetlands, coral reefs, and ocean margin ecosystems. The assessment considered the impacts of several key drivers of climate change: sea level change; alterations in precipitation patterns and subsequent delivery of freshwater, nutrients, and sediment; increased ocean temperature; alterations in circulation patterns; changes in frequency and intensity of coastal storms; and increased levels of atmospheric CO2. Increasing rates of sea-level rise and intensity and frequency of coastal storms and hurricanes over the next decades will increase threats to shorelines, wetlands, and coastal development. Estuarine productivity will change in response to alteration in the timing and amount of freshwater, nutrients, and sediment delivery. Higher water temperatures and changes in freshwater delivery will alter estuarine stratification, residence time, and eutrophication. Increased ocean temperatures are expected to increase coral bleaching and higher CO2 levels may reduce coral calcification, making it more difficult for corals to recover from other disturbances, and inhibiting poleward shifts. Ocean warming is expected to cause poleward shifts in the ranges of many other organisms, including commercial species, and these shifts may have secondary effects on their predators and prey.

P.","The consequences of global warming and associated environmental changes for freshwater lakes and rivers in North America, are reviewed. Despite their generally isolated geographic locations, the freshwaters of the north are subjected to a wide spectrum of environmental stressors. High-latitude regions are especially sensitive to the effects of recent climatic warming, which have already resulted in marked regime shifts in the biological communities of many Arctic lakes and ponds. Important drivers of these limnological changes include changes in the amount and duration of snow and ice cover, and for rivers and lakes in their deltas, the frequency and extent of spring floods. Other important climate-related shifts include alterations in evaporation and precipitation ratios, marked changes in the quality and quantity of lake and river water inflows due to accelerated glacier and permafrost melting, and declining percentages of precipitation that falls as snow. The depletion of stratospheric ozone over the north, together with the clarity of many Arctic lakes, renders them especially susceptible to damage from ultraviolet radiation. In addition, the long-range atmospheric transport of pollutants, coupled with the focusing effects of contaminant transport from biological vectors to some local ecosystems (e.g., salmon nursery lakes, ponds draining seabird colonies) and biomagnification in long food chains, have led to elevated concentrations of many persistent organic pollutants (e.g., insecticides, which have never been used in Arctic regions) and other pollutants (e.g., mercury).

These shifts may potentially increase flood risks in the early spring, and change the timing and volume of water in spring and early summer available for reservoir refill. Different parts of a basin may be affected differently by warming so that high elevation snowpack may experience minor impacts while low elevation sites may experience major changes Water resource managers have struggled to understand how to incorporate the knowledge provided by science into their planning and operations. This paper discusses a decision-making framework to bridge the gap between climate science and water management for the Columbia River Treaty 2014/2024 Review. The decision framework must be robust enough to accommodate risk characterization, screening and prioritization while allowing for adaptive management strategies that avoid maladaptations. Maladaptions are decisions that prevent or constrain the ability of others to manage, reduce or otherwise adapt to the effects of climate change in the future. Modeling systems used by the team will be capable of incorporating multiobjective analyses and alternative assessments running numerous future climate scenarios in physically based hydrologic, reservoir and hydraulic models that will ultimately support the decision-making framework.",2010,"","Innovations in Watershed Management under Land Use and Climate Change.

D.","Boreal forest fire regime, which encompasses fire intensity, frequency, seasonality, size, type (crown versus surface), and severity (depth of burn), is an organizing factor of boreal forest landscapes and highly dependant on climate. This review combines what is known about boreal forest dynamics from palaeological studies, with the information derived from state-of-the-art climate and vegetation modelling, to present possible scenarios of the impact of anticipated climate change on boreal forest ecosystem structure and function, particularly in relation to fire regimes. Anticipated climatic/atmospheric impact on plant physiological, communal, ecosystem, and finally landscape-level interactions with fire are reviewed. All indications from the modelling sector point towards unprecedented increased regional or seasonal temperatures, with projected changes most pronounced at high latitudes and there greatest in winter. Anticipated climate change scenarios are expected to alter dramatically the boreal forest ecosystems and fire regimes with which they are currently in equilibrium. Changed fire regimes could be represented by increased annual area burned because of an extended fire season, increased fire frequency, and severity. Simulation studies show the potential for greatly reduced boreal forest area and increased fragmentation due to climate change. Fire regime as an ecosystem process is highly sensitive to climate change because fire behaviour responds immediately to fuel moisture, which is affected by precipitation, relative humidity, air temperature, and wind speed. This interaction between climate change and fire regime has the potential to overshadow the importance of the direct effects of global warming on species distribution, migration, substitution, and extinction. Such a scenario suggests that rate and magnitude of fire-regime-induced changes to the boreal forest landscape could greatly exceed anything expected due to atmospheric warming alone. Socioeconomic implications of altered fire regimes in a changing climate are discussed in terms of adaptive fire management strategies, age class distribution, and such global stewardship issues as biodiversity, carbon cycling, and sequestration.",1997,"","Environmental Reviews","5","3/4","145-166","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/a97-008","","#24370","Weber 1997","","Biophysical; Intervention; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

G.; Collatz, G. J.","Disturbances are a major determinant of forest carbon stocks and uptake. They generally reduce land carbon stocks but also initiate a regrowth legacy that contributes substantially to the contemporary rate of carbon stock increase in US forestlands. As managers and policy makers increasingly look to forests for climate protection and mitigation, and because of increasing concern about changes in disturbance intensity and frequency, there is a need for synthesis and integration of current understanding about the role of disturbances and other processes in governing forest carbon cycle dynamics, and the likely future of this and other sinks for atmospheric carbon. This paper aims to address that need by providing a quantitative review of the distribution, extent and carbon impacts of the major disturbances active in the US. We also review recent trends in disturbances, climate, and other global environmental changes and consider their individual and collective contributions to the US carbon budget now and in the likely future. Lastly, we identify some key challenges and opportunities for future research needed to improve current understanding, advance predictive capabilities, and inform forest management in the face of these pressures. Harvest is found to be the most extensive disturbance both in terms of area and carbon impacts, followed by fire, windthrow and bark beetles, and lastly droughts. Collectively these lead to the gross loss of about 200 Tg C y-1 in live biomass annually across the conterminous US. At the same time, the net change in forest carbon stocks is positive (190 Tg C y-1), indicating not only forest resilience but also an apparently large response to growth enhancements such as fertilization by CO2 and nitrogen. Uncertainty about disturbance legacies, disturbance interactions, likely trends, and global change factors make the future of the US forest carbon sink unclear. While there is scope for management to enhance carbon sinks in US forests, tradeoffs with other values and uses are likely to significantly limit practical implementation. Continued and expanded remote sensing and field-based monitoring capabilities and manipulative experimentation are needed to improve understanding of the US forest carbon sink, and assess how disturbance processes are responding to the pressures of global environmental change. In addition, continued development and application of holistic, decision support tools that consider a range of forest values are needed to enable managers and policy makers to use the best available information for guiding forest resources now and into the future.",2016,"","Global and Planetary Change","143","","66-80","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2016.06.002","","#24485","Williams 2016","Matthew Schumm (2024-09-07 04:51:44)(Select): Figure 1 implies disturbances of forests up to and including transnational boundaries, which they describe as being exacerbated by climate change.; ","Biophysical; Biotic",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

J.; Patterson, T.; Schuur, E. A. G.; Verbyla, D. L.; Yarie, J.","The structure and function of Alaska's forests have changed significantly in response to a changing climate, including alterations in species composition and climate feedbacks (e.g., carbon, radiation budgets) that have important regional societal consequences and human feedbacks to forest ecosystems. In this paper we present the first comprehensive synthesis of climate-change impacts on all forested ecosystems of Alaska, highlighting changes in the most critical biophysical factors of each region. We developed a conceptual framework describing climate drivers, biophysical factors and types of change to illustrate how the biophysical and social subsystems of Alaskan forests interact and respond directly and indirectly to a changing climate. We then identify the regional and global implications to the climate system and associated socio-economic impacts, as presented in the current literature. Projections of temperature and precipitation suggest wildfire will continue to be the dominant biophysical factor in the Interior-boreal forest, leading to shifts from conifer- to deciduous-dominated forests. Based on existing research, projected increases in temperature in the Southcentral- and Kenai-boreal forests will likely increase the frequency and severity of insect outbreaks and associated wildfires, and increase the probability of establishment by invasive plant species. In the Coastal-temperate forest region snow and ice is regarded as the dominant biophysical factor. With continued warming, hydrologic changes related to more rapidly melting glaciers and rising elevation of the winter snowline will alter discharge in many rivers, which will have important consequences for terrestrial and marine ecosystem productivity. These climate-related changes will affect plant species distribution and wildlife habitat, which have regional societal consequences, and trace-gas emissions and radiation budgets, which are globally important. Our conceptual framework facilitates assessment of current and future consequences of a changing climate, emphasizes regional differences in biophysical factors, and points to linkages that may exist but that currently lack supporting research.

A review was conducted to determine the impacts of climate change on the impaired beneficial uses in the Great Lakes basin. Many climate related factors were used in this assessment including changes in: water temperature; water levels and flows; precipitation; air temperature; timing and duration of ice break up; and disturbance hazards (e.g., forest fires). Of the 14 impaired beneficial uses listed in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, 12 had a potential vulnerability to climate change. For instance, lower waters may have an impact on the areal extent and diversity of shoreline wetlands; receding shorelines could reduce spawning and nursery areas for fish; and pollution problems may be aggravated at recreational beaches, resulting in closures. Higher air temperatures could change the distribution and health of aquatic and terrestrial plant and animal species; may decrease the lake-ice season; and increase water temperatures that could enhance productivity and growth of undesirable species (e.g., algae blooms).

"105","Rocky intertidal communities: past environmental changes, present status and predictions for the next 25 years","Thompson, R C; Crowe, T P; Hawkins, S J","Rocky shores occur at the interface of the land and sea. Typically they are open ecosystems, with steep environmental gradients. Their accessibility to man has rendered them susceptible to a variety of impacts since prehistoric times. Access can be regulated, however, and they are more amenable to management than open ocean habitats. This review uses examples from throughout the world to demonstrate the extent to which rocky shores have been, and are currently, affected by pollution (examples used are endocrine disrupters, oil, eutrophication), over-collection of living resources, introduced alien species, modification of coastal processes (coastal defences, siltation) and global change (climate, sea level). These impacts are put into the context of natural fluctuations in time and variability in space of both the environment and the organisms. The relative magnitudes of some anthropogenic disturbances differ between the industrialized, developed world and the developing world. For example, in developed, industrialized countries pollution based impacts should diminish over the next 25 years due to improved regulation and a reduction in older `dirtier' heavy industry. Conversely, in many developing countries pollution will increase as a consequence of growth in the human population and industrialization. Except for large-scale disasters such as oil spills, pollution tends mainly to influence embayed coastlines. Chronic effects such as eutrophication can have broader-scale impacts over whole coastlines and elevated nutrient levels have also been implicated in a trend of increasing frequency of catastrophic kills due to harmful algal. Direct removal of living resources has had major effects on coastlines at both local and regional scales and is likely to increase over the next 25 years, especially in developing countries where rapidly expanding human populations will put further pressure on resources. Impacts from recreational activities are likely to increase with greater leisure time in wealthier regions of the world, and cheaper travel will spread these impacts to poorer regions. Invasions by alien species have increased in frequency during the last 20 years leading to some dramatic effects on native assemblages. Problems associated with alien species, especially pathogens, will continue to increase over the next few decades. The proportion of the coastline modified by artificial structures (breakwaters, seawalls, groynes) will increase because of coastal development and defences against sea-level rise and the greater frequency of storms.",2002,"06-01","Environmental Conservation","29","2","168-191","","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892902000115","","#25214","Thompson 2002","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-08-25 04:42:27)(Select): study doesn't discuss any specific transboundary flows in North America but very relevant in terms of seeing how rocky intertidal communities are responding to flows and changes due to climate change ;","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"106","Climate-driven risks to the climate mitigation potential of forests","","Risks to mitigation potential of forestsMuch recent attention has focused on the potential of trees and forests to mitigate ongoing climate change by acting as sinks for carbon. Anderegg et al. review the growing evidence that forests' climate mitigation potential is increasingly at risk from a range of adversities that limit forest growth and health. These include physical factors such as drought and fire and biotic factors, including the depredations of insect herbivores and fungal pathogens. Full assessment and quantification of these risks, which themselves are influenced by climate, is key to achieving science-based policy outcomes for effective land and forest management.Science, this issue p. eaaz7005BACKGROUNDForests have considerable potential to help mitigate human-caused climate change and provide society with a broad range of cobenefits. Local, national, and international efforts have developed policies and economic incentives to protect and enhance forest carbon sinks—ranging from the Bonn Challenge to restore deforested areas to the development of forest carbon offset projects around the world. However, these policies do not always account for important ecological and climate-related risks and limits to forest stability (i.e., permanence). Widespread climate-induced forest die-off has been observed in forests globally and creates a dangerous carbon cycle feedback, both by releasing large amounts of carbon stored in forest ecosystems to the atmosphere and by reducing the size of the future forest carbon sink. Climate-driven risks may fundamentally compromise forest carbon stocks and sinks in the 21st century. Understanding and quantifying climate-driven risks to forest stability are crucial components needed to forecast the integrity of forest carbon sinks and the extent to which they can contribute toward the Paris Agreement goal to limit warming well below 2°C. Thus, rigorous scientific assessment of the risks and limitations to widespread deployment of forests as natural climate solutions is urgently needed.ADVANCESMany forest-based natural climate solutions do not yet rely on the best available scientific information and ecological tools to assess the risks to forest stability from climate-driven forest dieback caused by fire, drought, biotic agents, and other disturbances. Crucially, many of these permanence risks are projected to increase in the 21st century because of climate change, and thus estimates based on historical data will underestimate the true risks that forests face. Forest climate policy needs to fully account for the permanence risks because they could fundamentally undermine the effectiveness of forest-based climate solutions.Here, we synthesize current scientific understanding of the climate-driven risks to forests and highlight key issues for maximizing the effectiveness of forests as natural climate solutions. We lay out a roadmap for quantifying current and forecasting future risks to forest stability using recent advances in vegetation physiology, disturbance ecology, mechanistic vegetation modeling, large-scale ecological observation networks, and remote sensing. Finally, we review current efforts to use forests as natural climate solutions and discuss how these programs and policies presently consider and could more fully embrace physiological, climatic, and permanence uncertainty about the future of forest carbon stores and the terrestrial carbon sink.OUTLOOKThe scientific community agrees that forests can contribute to global efforts to mitigate human-caused climate change. The community also recognizes that using forests as natural climate solutions must not distract from rapid reductions in emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Furthermore, responsibly using forests as natural climate solutions requires rigorous quantification of risks to forest stability, forests’ carbon storage potential, cobenefits for species conservation and ecosystem services, and full climate feedbacks from albedo and other effects. Combining long-term satellite records with forest plot data can provide rigorous, spatially explicit estimates of climate change–driven stresses and disturbances that decrease productivity and increase mortality. Current vegetation models also hold substantial promise to quantify forest risks and inform forest management and policies, which currently rely predominantly on historical data.A more-holistic understanding and quantification of risks to forest stability will help policy-makers effectively use forests as natural climate solutions. Scientific advances have increased our ability to characterize risks associated with a number of biotic and abiotic factors, including risks associated with fire, drought, and biotic agent outbreaks. While the models that are used to predict disturbance risks of these types represent the cutting edge in ecology and Earth system science to date, relatively little infrastructure and few tools have been developed to interface between scientists and foresters, land managers, and policy-makers to ensure that science-based risks and opportunities are fully accounted for in policy and management contexts. To enable effective policy and management decisions, these tools must be openly accessible, transparent, modular, applicable across scales, and usable by a wide range of stakeholders. Strengthening this science-policy link is a critical next step in moving forward with leveraging forests in climate change mitigation efforts.Forests have considerable potential to help mitigate human-caused climate change and provide society with many cobenefits. However, climate-driven risks may fundamentally compromise forest carbon sinks in the 21st century. Here, we synthesize the current understanding of climate-driven risks to forest stability from fire, drought, biotic agents, and other disturbances. We review how efforts to use forests as natural climate solutions presently consider and could more fully embrace current scientific knowledge to account for these climate-driven risks. Recent advances in vegetation physiology, disturbance ecology, mechanistic vegetation modeling, large-scale ecological observation networks, and remote sensing are improving current estimates and forecasts of the risks to forest stability.

Recently, this species has become increasingly challenged by Cronartium ribicola (white pine blister rust). This review examines literature relevant to P. strobiformis taxonomy, environmental associations, community associations, stand dynamics, and fire and disturbance ecology in order to better inform the management of this understudied species. In its US range, P. strobiformis occurs in central and southern Arizona and New Mexico and western Texas and has been documented as far north as southwestern Colorado. In Mexico, it occurs in northeastern Sonora, western Chihuahua and Durango, northern Zacatecas, southern Coahuila and central Nuevo Leon. Although P. strobiformis is a relatively high-elevation species preferring mesic habitats, it occurs across a variety of aspects, slope positions, and elevations. It rarely dominates forest composition but is most often found in complex species mixtures. While located in mixed-conifer habitats at the northern end of its range, it is associated with more diverse forest communities in the southern part of its range. Studies generally indicate P. strobiformis is a mid-seral species, although its low abundance and broad environmental amplitude complicate classification. Regeneration ecology is poorly understood, but bird and rodent seed dispersal do occur in portions of its range. Historical fire regimes in P. strobiformis mixed-conifer forests in the US were primarily characterized by frequent, low-severity surface fire, with less evidence of mixed- and high-severity fire. In Mexico, low-severity surface fire appears to have been ubiquitous within P. strobiformis habitats, with historical fire regimes still largely intact. Information is limited on the effects of disturbances other than fire. Increased temperatures and drought severity associated with climate change could potentially shrink the distribution of P. strobiformis, while altering its dominance in future forest communities.

However, the extent and effects of increased SO₄²⁻ concentrations in freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems remain poorly understood regarding many aspects of ecosystem structure and functioning. Here, we review the sources of SO₄²⁻ pollution, environmental impacts on freshwater ecosystems and bioremediation opportunites and we identify key knowledge gaps and future research needs. Natural sources of dissolved SO₄²⁻ in freshwater ecosystems include mineral weathering, volcanic activity, decomposition and combustion of organic matter, oxidation of sulphides, and sea spray aerosols. Acid mine drainage, fertiliser leaching from agricultural soils, wetland drainage, agricultural and industrial wastewater runoff as well as sea level changes are the main direct and indirect sources of the anthropogenic SO₄²⁻ input to waterbodies. Increasing SO₄²⁻ concentrations in freshwater systems influence the biogeochemical processes of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Similarly, iron availability can be critical in determining the adverse effects of SO₄²⁻ on environmental receptors. The literature reviewed clearly demonstrates that SO₄²⁻ pollution may have toxic effects on aquatic plants and animal organisms, including, among others, fishes, invertebrates and amphibians, and it may also have negative implications for human health. Bioremediation systems provide opportunities to mitigate the impacts of SO₄²⁻, but removal efficiencies range widely from 0% to 70% across treatment systems such as constructed wetlands, permeable reactive barriers and bioreactors. We conclude that examination of increased SO₄²⁻ concentrations and fluxes at different spatial scales is urgently needed as the ongoing global perturbation of the S cycle is likely to be accelerated by climate change and human development activities. The adverse effects of this on freshwater organisms worldwide may prove detrimental to the future well-being of humans and ecosystems.

Both controllable and uncontrollable factors for nitrate loss have been the subject of several previous studies. Due to differences in climate, biophysical dissimilarities and land management characteristics in different parts of the world the factors affecting nitrate loss are often inconsistent and hence difficult to generalize. Therefore, reanalyzing the experimental field or plot scale studies to understand the nitrate loss factors in crop fields is useful and necessary in developing management strategies for reducing nitrate loss. This research synthesized and investigated 36 peer reviewed scientific journal articles related to selected bioenergy crop fields that included: continuous corn, corn in rotation with soybean, switchgrass and Miscanthus to conduct a meta-analysis of the available research. In this study, factors such as drain tile spacing, tillage practices, type and timing of the fertilization rate, irrigation and various other factors, which are challenging to represent in regression equations, were also systematically analyzed. In addition, various other agronomic characteristics that are attributed too nitrate loss are caused by perennially planted bio energized crops such as Miscanthus and switchgrass. Results indicated that 49% of nitrate loss through surface runoff from corn fields is directly related to the annual precipitation and fertilization rate. Multiple linear regression equations were developed to estimate the annual subsurface nitrate loss for the continuous corn fields with a R2 value of 0.65, 0.58 and 0.26 for sandy loam, silty loam and clay loam, respectively. Our analysis resulted in the conclusion that corn has a 2 to 3 times higher nitrate loss in surface runoff compared to switchgrass. Likewise, continuous corn and corn in rotation with soybean contributed more than 9 times the subsurface loss of nitrate compared to the established subsurface loss attributed to the Miscanthus and switchgrass.",2017,"01-01","Agriculture","7","3","27","","https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture7030027","","#26983","Sharma 2017","","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The main tracks of transmission are known; however, the relative importance of each of the components and the respective environmental risk factors are unclear. We aimed to assess and specify quantitative evidence of environmental risks of leptospirosis transmission.Methods/findingsA database of pre-selected studies, with publication dates from 1970 until 2008, was provided by an expert group. The database has been updated until 2015 using a text mining algorithm. Study selection was based on stringent quality criteria. A descriptive data analysis was performed to calculate the medians of the log transformed odds ratios. From a selection of 2723 unique publications containing information on leptospirosis, 428 papers dealing with risk factors were identified. Of these, 53 fulfilled the quality criteria, allowing us to identify trends in different geo-climatic regions. Water associated exposures were, with few exceptions, associated with an increased leptospirosis risk. In resource poor countries, floods and rainfall were of particular importance, whereas recreational water activities were more relevant in developed countries. Rodents were associated with increased leptospirosis risk, but the variation among studies was high, which might be partly explained by differences in exposure definition. Livestock contact was commonly associated with increased risk; however, several studies found no association. The median odds ratios associated with dog and cat contacts were close to unity. Sanitation and behavioural risk factors were almost always strongly associated with leptospirosis, although their impact was rarely investigated in Europe or North America.ConclusionThis review confirms the complex environmental transmission pathways of leptospirosis, as previously established. Although, floods appeared to be among the most important drivers on islands and in Asia, the consistent pattern observed for exposure to rodents and behavioural and sanitation related risk factors indicate potential areas for intervention.",2015,"09-01","PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases","9","9","n/a","","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003843","","#27339","Mwachui 2015","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-17 07:33:32)(Select): including: climate change not explicit, but connection between changing precip/heavy flooding and disease transmission is related to climate change; ","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"112","A tale of two basins: An integrated physical and biological perspective of the deep Arctic Ocean","Bluhm, B A; Kosobokova, K N; Carmack, E C","This review paper integrates the current knowledge, based on available literature, on the physical and biological conditions of the Amerasian and Eurasian basins (AB, EB) of the deep Arctic Ocean (AO) in a comparative fashion. The present day (Holocene) AO is a mediterranean sea that is roughly half continental shelf and half basin and ridge complex. Even more recently it is roughly two thirds seasonally and one third perennially ice-covered, thus now exposing a portion of basin waters to sunlight and wind. Basin boundaries and submarine ridges steer circulation pathways in overlying waters and limit free exchange in deeper waters. The AO is made integral to the global ocean by the Northern Hemisphere Thermohaline Circulation (NHTC) which drives Pacific-origin water (PW) through Bering Strait into the Canada Basin, and counter-flowing Atlantic-origin water (AW) through Fram Strait and across the Barents Sea into the Nansen Basin. As a framework for biogeography within the AO, four basic, large-scale circulation systems (with L>1000km) are noted; these are: (1) the large scale wind-driven circulation which forces the cyclonic Trans-Polar Drift from Siberia to the Fram Strait and the anticyclonic Beaufort Gyre in the southern Canada Basin; (2) the circulation of waters that comprise the halocline complex, composed largely of waters of Pacific and Atlantic origin that are modified during passage over the Bering/Chukchi and Barents/Siberian shelves, respectively; (3) the topographically-trapped Arctic Circumpolar Boundary Current (ACBC) which carries AW cyclonically around the boundaries of the entire suite of basins, and (4) the very slow exchange of Arctic Ocean Deep Waters. Within the basin domain two basic water mass assemblies are observed, the difference between them being the absence or presence of PW sandwiched between Arctic Surface Waters (ASW) above and the AW complex below; the boundary between these domains is the Atlantic/Pacific halocline front. Both domains have vertical stratification that constrains the transfer of nutrients to the surface layer (euphotic zone), thus leading to their oligotrophic state, particularly in the more strongly stratified Pacific Arctic where, despite high nutrient values in the inflow, convective reset of surface layer nutrients by haline convection in winter is virtually absent. First and multi-year sea ice drastically alters albedo and insulates the underlying water column from extreme winter heat loss while its mechanical properties (thickness, concentration, roughness, etc.) greatly affect the efficiency of momentum transfer from the wind to the underlying water. Biologically, sea ice algal growth in the basins is proportionally almost equal to or exceeding phytoplankton production, and is a habitat and transport platform for sympagic (ice-associated) fauna. Owing to nutrient limitation due to strong stratification and light limitation due to snow and ice cover and extreme sun angle, primary production in the two basin domains is very low compared to the adjacent shelves. Severe nutrient limitation and complete euphotic zone drawdown in the AB favors small phytoplankton, a ubiquitous deep chlorophyll maximum layer, a low f-ratio of new to recycled carbon fixation, and a low energy food web. In contrast, nutrients persist –albeit in low levels– in the western EB, even in summer, suggesting light limitation, heavy grazing or both. The higher stocks of nutrients in the EB are more conducive to marginal ice blooms than in the AB. The large-scale ocean currents (NHTC and ACBC) import substantial expatriate, not locally reproducing zooplankton biomass especially from the adjoining subarctic Atlantic (primarily Calanus finmarchicus), but also from the Pacific (e.g., Pseudocalanus spp., Neocalanus spp. and Metridia pacifica). These advective inputs serve both as source of food to resident pelagic and benthic biota within the basins, and as potential grazers exerting top down control on limited phytoplankton resources. Benthic organisms within the AO basin show previously unappreciated biodiversity and surprising dispersion of species given the isolation of individual basins and low vertical carbon flux and resulting biomass. Larval dispersion is aided by the large-scale flows and perhaps, we hypothesize in the deep benthos by convective updrafts driven by geothermal heating. Zooplankton diversity, in contrast, is low, but again faunal assemblages are equally distributed between the EB and AB. Species pools of both pelagic and benthic communities change more with water depth rather than laterally, with the exception of expatriates and rare species, with close ties to today’s North Atlantic biogeographic region. Climate related change in the AO is thus manifest at significantly differing time scales. Throughout ∼90% of the Pleistocene the AO has existed in glacial mode, with narrow continental shelves, greatly restricted river inflow, thicker and perhaps immobile sea ice, and total blockage of exchange with the Pacific Ocean. During the Holocene, on shorter time scales of 1000–100years, significant changes in high latitude climate are tied to changes in temperature and perhaps moisture delivery patterns. The Arctic also experiences significant multi-decadal variability; however, the pace of change over the past three decades has been without precedent. Within the basin interior the ice is now thinner and less compact, and thus more responsive to wind stress (forcing and mixing). Concurrent with sea ice melt and increased river flow, the accumulation of fresh water and the stratification have increased, thus constraining vertical nutrient flux affecting phytoplankton size distributions, limiting primary production in parts of the basins now and likely in the future, and increasing vulnerability to acidification. In addition, sea ice is now retreating on an annual basis past the shelf break, exposing basin waters directly to sunlight and wind forcing. Thus, upwelling favorable winds (generally from east to west) can now directly and efficiently drive shelf-break upwelling, and draw nutrients from subsurface basin waters onto the shelf; at the same time upwelling favorable winds will also create onshore pressure gradients over the slope and basin which will act to slow or block the flow of waters in the ACBC, and thus alter advective pathways of both abiotic and biotic materials. Given the opening of a new ocean to multiple user groups, we expect that the central AO will play an increasing larger role both in the research and political arenas in the future, and we encourage pan-Arctic international collaboration over focus on territorial boundaries.",2015,"12-01","Progress in oceanography","139 p.89-121","","89-121","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2015.07.011","","#29150","Bluhm 2015","Matthew Schumm (2024-08-28 08:23:46)(Select): Figure 5 implies flows from waters off Canada to those off Alaska.
