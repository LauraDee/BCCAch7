moth in North America (Gray, 2004), climate has been shown to pose
unexpected limits to the gypsy moth range edge. For example, the patterns of range edge dynamics in eastern Virginia, characterized by overall
stasis and range retraction with high temporal variability (Figure 3), were
unexpected given the suitability of winter climate in the southeastern
United States for gypsy moth. Spread rates in this region were found
to be negatively correlated to hours of spring/summer temperature
above optimal for gypsy moth growth (Tobin et al., 2014).","","","","","","","","Increase","","","","","USA -> CAN","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.11.010","Gypsy moth is a generalist feeder of broad-leafed trees, with aspen, birch, oak, and

Unabated spread of gypsy moth and the economic costs associated
with increasing forest damage and management in the 1980s led to
the implementation of the STS programme as the lead initiative for
invasion front management (Roberts & Ziegler, 2007; Sharov, Leonard,
Liebhold, Roberts, & Dickerson, 2002).

However, given the susceptibility of the next tier of states in advance of the invasion front in the 1990s, where 50%–80% of forested land was classified as highly at
risk (Morin et al., 2004), it was recognized that slowing the spread
was not only economically viable but also highly beneficial (McManus,
2007).","","Increase","","","","","","","","Rising temperatures increased the rate of spread of gypsy moth (which is now referred to as spongy moth, fyi) including from US to Canada.","Yes","Monitoring and local suppression:

The management objective of the STS programme is to reduce
spread rates of gypsy moth through monitoring and local suppression
of isolated populations beyond the advancing front. Monitoring is
achieved by annually trapping males using delta or milk carton style
traps that are baited with disparlure, the synthetic version of the gypsy
moth pheromone, and deploying the traps in an extensive spatially referenced grid both along and ahead of the invasion front (Sharov et al., 2002). The trapping programme focuses on the “transition zone” between the generally infested area, where populations are established, and the uninfested area (Liebhold, Sharov, & Tobin, 2007; Figure 2).","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No","","","","",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

","No","","Physical","river flow","water flow in river networks","Air temperature variability, Precipitation directional change, Precipitation variability, Drought","","Changes in rainfall and temperature patterns have led to prolonged heatwaves, abrupt decreases in water flow, or large floods, which are subsequently altering temporal patterns of water flow in river networks over large areas of the Earth. Low water flow periods have become longer (Döll & Zhang, 2010) and, as a result, river systems experience progressively stronger transitions towards slow- flowing phases (Sabater, 2008) or are completely interrupted (Messager et al., 2021). ;; At the other extreme of hydrological events, large floods have become more frequent (Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Arnell & Gosling, 2016), and already produce long-term effects in larger rivers of the world (e.g. Espinoza et al., 2022).;; River systems are increasingly affected by gradual changes (trend effects) and extreme events (event effects; Jentsch, Kreyling & Bejerkuhnlein, 2007) in their hydrology and climate patterns.","Complex change","Increase","","","","Increase","","","","","","","CAN <-> USA","","We found that extreme weather events had consistent, nega- tive impacts on biodiversity (species richness and biomass) of river ecosystems. We determined that, on average, event effects on biodiversity were twice as strong as trend effects, which adheres to the definition of extreme event disturbances as localized, high-energy, rapid changes in environmental conditions (Peters et al., 2011). Our results raise concerns about the future of riverine biodiversity since extreme events are increasingly frequent and will challenge the adaptation capacity of the biota (Ummenhofer & Meehl, 2017; Jentsch & White, 2019).
Event effects have driven considerable changes in a variety of ecosystems and biological compartments, spanning from soil microbiota (Fierer & Schimel, 2002), to meadow- dwelling insects (Piessens et al., 2009), to fish foraging in coral reefs (Stuart-Smith et al., 2021; Richardson et al., 2018). In rivers, abrupt changes in water flow and temperature directly affect the habitat extent and suitability for organisms as they cause rapid variations in hydraulic and chemical con- ditions (Guse et al., 2015; Petrovic et al., 2011; Ponsatí et al., 2015). These variations challenge the adaptability of many species, with potential effects on the composition, diversity, and abundance of biological communities. Our results show that such effects differ for different biological compartments, with some being more vulnerable than others.
Our synthesis of the available evidence reveals that river biota do not exhibit consistent responses to extreme events. While the species richness and biomass of invertebrates were consistently negatively affected by water flow interruption, microbial communities showed inconsistent responses, rang- ing from non-significant effects for benthic algal (biofilm) bio- mass to decreases for fungal biomass.;; In contrast to interruptions in water flow, floods did not show consistent impacts on either species richness or biomass. While flood events may lead to losses of algae and macroin- vertebrates via physical disturbance and washout (the scour- ing effect; Feeley et al., 2012) and cause important changes in the geomorphological structure of rivers, they do not nec- essarily affect all taxonomic groups similarly (Piniewski et al., 2017).;; Contrasting with responses in biodiversity, the ecosystem functions of rivers did not exhibit consistent, negative responses to weather variability. Only primary productivity exhibited a negative response to event effects, largely due to a negative response to extreme water flow decreases.

There also appears to be a consensus that increasing mean temperatures are correlated with, and are thought to be a cause of, increased water stress. As temperatures rise, water stress may result from less water, increases in evaporation, and increases in agricultural water demand. But the link between temperature and water stress is not unique to drought. Recent papers demonstrate that a combination of higher temperatures and rainfall extremes are correlated with increases in migration rates away from areas where these changes can be observed. This being said, the causal interaction of temperature, water stress and migration is still not clearly understood. More systematic studies are needed.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. ix](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=11&annotation=98F6838C))

“In some cases, a reduction in effective rainfall and/or loss of access to irrigation water and other ecosystem services can render an existing livelihood inoperable, thus making the search for alternative livelihood necessary. The search for alternative livelihoods may or may not entail migration. One of the most compelling findings emerging from recent research is that in dryland agricultural areas increased surface temperature extremes and variability have an influence on migration (Cattaneo and Peri, 2016). It appears that extreme and long-lasting rises in temperature can increase the frequency of long dry spells (droughts), which in turn increase the frequency of crop failure and, as a result, can increase out-migration from agriculturally dependent societies (Gray and Mueller, 2012; Henry et al., 2004; Cai et al., 2017).”

“Virtually every study included in this literature review concluded that migration within specific life stages is common and that, to a large degree, migration patterns can be explained by global economic development as well as social and demographic changes in recent decades. These studies, however, show that there are clear instances in which novel conditions of water stress affect livelihood expectations, destroy assets and alter rates at which people change residences on a temporary, seasonal, cyclical or permanent basis.”

“In general, water stresses such as drought, dry spells, changing rainfall variability and extremes that result in declining smallholder and subsistence agricultural production may accelerate or amplify migration patterns (e.g. Nawrotski and Bakhtsiyarava, 2017; Cai et al., 2016).”

Examples of the above are given for Mexico -> USA. Canada is also mentioned, but in a context that makes it unclear whether the migration is internal or transboundary.

“extreme droughts contributed to migration from Mexico to the United States. Long-established migrant communities tended to originate from areas historically affected by drought, whereas new migrant communities originated from areas affected by more recent drought.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=21&annotation=NKJP3BTT))

“In another study, droughts in Mexico were related to migration in both wet and dry climates, and although drought drove migration in both contexts, in wetter climates social networks remained a stronger determinant in the decision to migrate (Nawrotski and Hunter, 2013).” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=21&annotation=B88PHM2W))

“This review finds that by controlling for multiple hazards, heat exposure can be identified as a stronger predictor of migration than drought, increasing climate variability or extreme rainfall and flooding. Heat amplifies the potential for migration across a range of water stresses. This has been shown to be the case in country-level studies in Pakistan (Mueller et al., 2014), Indonesia (Bohra-Mishra et al., 2016), the Philippines (Bohra-Mishra et al., 2017), Mexico (Nawrotski et al., 2015, 2016), West Africa (Nawrotski and Bakhtsiyarava, 2016) and South Africa (Mastorillo et al., 2016), as well as global comparative studies (see Cai et al., 2016). Bohra-Mishra et al. 2014, 2016) found that in Indonesia and the Philippines, anomalously high temperatures amplified the migration effect of both drought and extreme rainfall. Significantly, migration responses to heat are non-linear and changes in migration are observed beyond specific temperature thresholds in the form of extreme temperatures (see Cai et al., 2016) as well as long-lasting temperatures (see Nawrotski et al., 2017)... One potential explanation is that extreme or sustained heat increases evaporation and decreases the water content of the topsoil to the detriment of shallow root crops commonly associated with subsistence agricultural production. This phenomenon would explain migration as a response to water shortages, as well, when water storage does not meet agricultural water demands. Another potential explanation is that heat is a variable that can be measured and evaluated comparatively, while drought declaration procedures involve a host of sociopolitical as well as biophysical considerations.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=22&annotation=4ZBZKHQL))

“Nawrotski et al. (2017) observed that, in Mexico, once a threshold of ~34 heat months (months in which the maximum temperature was more than 1 standard deviation above the 1951-1980 reference period) was surpassed, the relationship between heat months and the rate of rural-urban migration became positive and progressively strengthened.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=22&annotation=DT97IQFP))

An important note on short-term hazards: “recent consensus has emerged in the literature around the finding that impacts of catastrophic flooding on homes or assets are much weaker predictors of permanent migration. Studies from a variety of contexts show that flooding and disaster have modest or only short-term effects on migration (Gray and Mueller, 2012; Lu et al., 2016)” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=21&annotation=8JN2USQE))

“One finding from relatively early work by Munshi et al. (2003) is common in many contexts. The authors found that extreme droughts contributed to migration from Mexico to the United States. Long-established migrant communities tended to originate from areas historically affected by drought, whereas new migrant communities originated from areas affected by more recent drought. It is noteworthy that migrants were found to follow existing patterns of migration that had been established earlier and independently of drought. In other words, migrants whose decisions were related to drought followed in the footsteps of previous migrants. These findings are echoed throughout the literature; migrant networks and corridors are not new, and when water stress drives new patterns of migration, they usually fold into existing spatial, temporal, seasonal and economic patterns of migration. Migration is completely normal, and environmental stress can be one driver among many (Black et al., 2011a).” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=21&annotation=NKJP3BTT))","MEX -> USA","Nawrotski and Hunter 2013; Feng et al 2010; Nawrotski et al 2015; Nawrotski et al 2017;Munshi 2003; poor citations in paper make it difficult to identify exact papers","“Several papers conclude that migration can produce water stress through impacts to ecosystem services that support water provisioning, water distribution systems, flood management systems and safe drinking water (Selby and Hoffman 2012; Biswas and Quiroz, 1996; Jacobsen, 1997; McMichael et al., 2012; Talozi et al., 2015; Chatterjee, 2010; Metulini et al., 2016; Rufola et al., 2015; Black, 1994; Mbonile, 2005; Wiesmann, 2000). These papers conclude that, in instances where environmental displacement and/or conflict-induced displacement cause migrants (or refugees) to live in informal settlements, those involved can be locked into future water stress (see Rufola et al., 2015). This is especially the case where the informal settlement entails forms of land use that are water-intensive or destructive to local water cycles. To this end, the literature identifies three mechanisms. First, migrants can decide or be forced to settle on marginal or fragile lands in a manner that can increase the risk of water stress.

Different people migrate differently in response to drought and water-supply stress (Curran, 2002; Henry et al., 2004). Men and women may migrate differently, as may elderly and young people, and relatively wealthy and poor people. Whatever the population, responsiveness that may result in migration is dependent on the complex cultural, political and environmental context in which decisions are made (see Black et al., 2011a). Concerningly, in recent years, empirical research has identified populations that are unwilling or unable to engage in labour migration (see Adams, 2016). The capacity to migrate of these populations may be eroding gradually over time, increasing the likelihood of a humanitarian crisis and the need for sustained, high-level interventions (see Black et al., 2011a).”","Increasing incidence of drought and extreme temperatures can lead to increased rates of transboundary migration. Generally, migrant communities have the potential to impact host country ecosystem services through shifting land use and degradation. This paper calls out water-related ES specifically, such as flood management and water provisioning/distribution.","Yes","“A number of the reviewed articles argue for the adoption of proactive policies and programmes that seek to reduce migration. Typically, these articles identify a case for investment in sustainable agriculture and rural livelihood diversification. In waterstressed areas, experience suggests that such policies and programmes can both slow rural-urban migration and reduce the incentive for people to attempt to move across international borders out of desperation rather than out of choice.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. ix](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=11&annotation=9ZZKK8AN))

“There is also a dearth of knowledge about the influence of investments that alleviate water stress on migration – especially in areas dominated by irrigated agriculture. Studies in multiple contexts imply that public investments in rural agriculture adaptation could attenuate rapid rural-urban migration (Nawrotski et al., 2017). These findings indicate that rural adaptation measures may deserve greater attention as a means to create opportunities and reduce vulnerability to climate stresses and shocks so that people do not feel forced to abandon their agricultural land. More comprehensive assessments of the impacts of adaptation interventions on forms of forced migration, such as forced displacement, could help policy-makers understand the value of public expenditures towards rural economic diversification. To this end, more research is needed on the effect of rural agriculture adaptation policies on migration, and the effect of migration on coordinated adaptation. Adaptive policies and programmes that might be of assistance include: land tenure reforms; development of robust water-sharing systems; development of drought-resistant crop varieties; crop insurance mechanisms; and other measures to buffer the impact of repeated losses associated with water stress.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=14&annotation=CTMW9LYM))

“Among multilateral international institutions, the policy problems associated with environment-related migration have been addressed primarily by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which has focused on cross-border labour migration issues, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has focused on the potential for population displacement across borders as a result of climate change.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=15&annotation=JABH3B3S))

“While there is no legal category guaranteeing special protections for environmental migrants (i.e. “climate refugees”), the IOM formally defined “environmental migrants” in the UNFCCC (2007) as “persons or groups of persons who, for reasons of sudden or progressive changes in the environment that adversely affect their lives or living conditions, are obliged to have to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move either within their territory or abroad"""" (pp. 1-2)” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=15&annotation=DPL3V7F8))

“Policy norms have been advanced that call on states to mutually recognize the rights of non-citizens migrating across borders due to climate impacts (Warner, 2010).” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=15&annotation=BAQSRCAI))

“Universally, the literature emphasizes the strong mediating role of institutions and policy on the water stress-migration link. On the one hand, vulnerabilities to water stress that lead to migration can be associated with a legacy of planning decisions with long histories, or may result from short-term institutional failures. For example, the patterns of catastrophic flooding in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, which produced large-scale migration, was a result of the failure of a complex history of flood management decisions and zoning by federal, state and local authorities (see Fussell et al., 2014). On the other hand, effective and timely drought and flood responses have been shown to mitigate the incentive for people to migrate. For example, Marchildon et al. (2008) have shown that drought incidence is associated with out-migration in rural Canada, except in places where government relief programmes have mitigated the negative consequences of drought. Such findings highlight the effects of intervention in ameliorating the environmental drivers of migration.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=24))

“the decisions of agriculture-dependent people to migrate do not immediately follow environmental stress, but only happen after people have exhausted other adaptation options.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=22&annotation=BL8RSWQ5))

“A handful of articles have shown that policies that are ill-conceived or unresponsive to migrant needs can exacerbate friction between impoverished migrants and the community that hosts them. For example, Bhavanani and Lacina (2015) investigated the Sons of the Soil movement in India, in which migrants (moving in part due to drought) have been implicated in destructive riots. They find that inclusive host communities with access to the resources necessary to accommodate migrants can resolve social conflicts more efficiently than host communities without sufficient resources to accommodate migrant needs. Without sufficient resources, relationships between hosts and migrants can fray.

“Migration is usually a delayed response to water stress and its emergence in data sets is even more delayed. Findings from various papers indicated that migration likelihood is low immediately after a water shock, but increases as households cycle through the various in situ adaptation strategies available. If the shock is not repeated for an extended period of time (as illustrated in Mexico; see Nawrotski et al., 2015) then migration rates stabilize. This suggests that households can successfully adapt in situ to a one-time incidence of water shock.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=33&annotation=THSNM2AC))

“Climate change poses risks to communities and livelihoods via impacts on ecosystem “goods and services,” loss of arable land, and increased severity and frequency of climate related disasters (OliverSmith 2009). These impacts may cause people to turn increasingly to migration as an adaptive strategy (Black 2001; Castles 2002; Renaud et al. 2007). However, climate change will not act alone in shaping population movement; rather, “it produces environmental effects and exacerbates current vulnerabilities that make it difficult for people to survive where they are” [International Organisation for Migration (IOM) 2009]. For less developed countries in particular, social, demographic, political, and economic stressors—such as high population density, limited economic opportunity, inequitable distribution of resources and ser vices, poor urban and land use planning, and armed conflict—will coexist with climate risks and influence migration decisions (Tacoli 2009). Hence, disaggregating the impacts of climate change from those of other processes is difficult, particularly slow onset environ mental changes (Adamo 2010).” ([McMichael et al., 2012, p. 647](zotero://select/library/items/ULVSWDCU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2888YDQ2?page=2&annotation=YEBRGZRK))

“migration is not necessarily an indicator of vulnerability: It can be an adaptive response by communities to cope with the effects of climate change (Black 2001; U.K. Government Office for Science 2011).

The relationship between extreme cli matic events and migration is complex, but displacement is typically temporary because people tend to return to rebuild housing and livelihoods in places with which they are familiar (Black 2001; Castles 2002; Johnson and Krishnamurthy 2010; Lonergan 1998; PerchNielson et al. 2008; Piguet 2008).

Many representatives felt their voices were not adequately represented during this multilateral report from the United Nations (UN). Therefore, the Anchorage gathering was to prepare a declaration of climate crisis and call to action for the UN and future IPCC reports (Martinez 2012).

Indeed, several economic models project that global warming will have more effects on the distribution of farm production rather than on global farm output (Darwin et al., 1995; World Bank, 2008: 16-17). The areas in which agricultural productivity is expected to decrease because of climate change include sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and parts of South America, while agricultural productivity may increase in currently colder areas such as Canada and Russia (Darwin et al., 1995; World Bank, 2008: 16-17)... These three links between global warming and the agricultural sector suggest two plausible patterns of migration. First, we might expect acceleration in the pace of rural urban migration within countries.

The associated vicariance promoted neutral genetic divergence as a direct evolutionary consequence of random genetic drift within refugial populations and low gene flow among them (Fig. 2, Hewitt 2000, 2004). At the end of the last glaciation, some of these genetically differentiated refugial populations (glacial lineages) expanded to colonize previously inhospitable habitats. Phylogeographic inferences regarding glacial refugia and postglacial migration pathways rely on the extant spatial distribution of genetic polymorphisms in the context of geographic barriers for dispersal (e.g., water bodies, mountain chains, deserts, glaciers) (Fig. 2). In plants, these inferences are often strengthened with pollen and macrofossil evidence (e.g., Magri et al. 2006, de Lafontaine et al. 2014a).  Author Manuscript In addition to unraveling the historical biogeography of a wide range of taxa, phylogeographic surveys published over the past 15 years have better characterized the erosion of genetic diversity along migration routes. Postglacial range expansions occur primarily through dispersal of the populations located near the expanding edge of the refugial distribution. The newly established populations are initially small and susceptible to random genetic drift. As a result of founder effects at the expanding edge during the course of migration, a reduction of molecular genetic diversity is expected within the newly colonized area as it harbors only a subset of the original gene pool of refugial populations (Ibrahim et al. 1996, Slatkin and Excoffier 2012). Although a poleward erosion of genetic diversity should be expected when considering a given genetic lineage along its migration route, regions of high intrapopulation genetic diversity but low interpopulation differentiation have often been reported at mid-latitudes (Petit et al. 2003, Hampe and Petit 2005).","Increase","Increase","Increase","","","","","Increase","Complex change","","","","USA -> CAN, CAN -> USA","","Prolonged isolation in distinct glacial refugia may have resulted in disproportionately high levels of genetic differentiation among refugial populations, leading to high levels of regional genetic diversity despite low levels of intrapopulation diversity and a lack of isolation-by-distance (Hampe and Petit 2005, de Lafontaine et al. 2013). Thus, populations in glacial refugia are also expected to contain a relatively high abundance of endemic and ancestral variants, which may be lost during colonization through random genetic drift and repeated founder effects (Petit et al. 2003). As a result, genetic and geographic distances are often correlated positively along migration pathways, reflecting the long-lasting genetic gradient generated by serial founder events or surfing (i.e., genetic drift occurring at the wave front of an expanding population, Excoffier and Ray 2008) during postglacial range colonization (de Lafontaine et al. 2013).

This is a summary of the impacts they found globally (not specific to North America) are: The literature suggests that climate change will impact nutrient dynamics around the globe and exacerbate contemporary water-quality challenges. Nutrient leaching and overland flow transport are projected to increase globally, promoted by extreme precipitation. Seasonal variations in stream- flow are expected to emulate changing precipitation patterns, but the specific local impacts of climate change on hydrology and nutrient dynamics will vary both seasonally and regionally. Plant activity may reduce some of this load in nonagricultural soils if the expected increase in plant uptake of nutrients prompted by increased temperatures can compensate for greater nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) mineralization, N deposition, and leaching rates. High-temperature forest and grass fires may help reduce mineralization and microbial turnover by altering N speciation via the pyrolysis of organic matter. In agricultural areas that are at higher risk of erosion, extreme precipitation will exacerbate existing water-quality issues, and greater plant nutrient uptake may lead to an increase in fertilizer use. Future urban expansion will amplify these effects. Higher ambi- ent temperatures will promote harmful cyanobacterial blooms by enhancing thermal stratification, increasing nutrient load into streams and lakes from extreme precipitation events, decreasing summer flow and thus baseflow dilution capacity, and increasing water and nutrient residence times during increasingly frequent droughts.

In addition, some tribes along the Pacific coast can establish water rights to support tribal fishery rights that date to “time immemorial” (Chaffin, Craig, & Gosnell, 2014; Craig et al., 2017). While many tribal water rights still need to be quantified, they nevertheless are very large and very old water rights that can profoundly influence surface water management, particularly in the West (Chaffin et al., 2014).

One relatively new concern in groundwater law is tribal groundwater rights (Shosteck, 2003). In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld Winters rights in aquifers, sparking new attention to tribal interests in groundwater even before the case was decided (Quesenberry, Seward, & Bailey, 2015). Nevertheless, given the recentness of this decision, full exposition of how climate change and tribal groundwater rights will interact with each other and with other water rights remains undeveloped, although Bass (2018, p. 229) noted that “[a]s water becomes scarcer, as competing uses strain California's finite water supplies, and as California transitions to a new groundwater management scheme, judicial recognition of tribes' rights to control their groundwater resources may become an increasingly important—and urgent—tribal objective.

Finally, Native American tribes are becoming increasingly important water rights holders and water managers across the United States. Particularly in the West, water rights settlements and court decrees are progressively quantifying tribal water rights, which are often very senior water rights. Across the nation, tribes are increasingly accepting Congress's invitation through the Clean Water Act to manage water quality on their reservations. The some-times fairly dramatic and legally controversial activation of this third water sovereign can visibly change water management power dynamics and politics, as has occurred in the Klamath River Basin (Chaffin et al., 2014). Nevertheless, tribes' roles at the nexus of climate change and water law have received embarrassingly little attention, even in places like Florida where tribes have had independent management authority for decades.
","Climate change (generic)","","Climate change's effects on water resources generally first become visible in surface waters. Not surprisingly, then, much legal scholarship discussing the relationship between climate change and water law in the United States focuses on how water law can cope with changes to surface waters—lakes, rivers, and streams. Because most of this research has concentrated on western water issues, moreover, this part begins with prior appropriation and its relationship to cli-mate change.


The first complication in discussing the relationship between climate change and water law is the fact that the United States is a large and climatologically diverse nation. As a result, climate change affects water resources differently in different regions, resulting in different implications for state water law. In some regions of the United States, such as the Southwest, the predominant climate change water problem is the progressive reduction of fresh water as the region grows hotter and drier, punctuated by increasingly severe droughts, although some parts will grow more variable (United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), 2019). In other regions, such as in the previously reliably humid Mississippi and Missouri River watersheds and the Southeast, climate-change driven water law problems will likely arise from increased variability in precipitation, where a year or two of record flooding flips to unprecedented drought (USGCRP, 2019). Finally, climate change alterations to both the form of precipitation (generally less snow and more rain) and timing of spring rains and runoff (generally earlier in the year) will challenge water law in still other regions of the United States, such as the Pacific Northwest (USGCRP, 2019).



Nevertheless, legal scholarship addressing tribal adaptation to climate change is still developing, and legal researchers are only just beginning to think about the relationship between climate change and tribal water rights. As one of the first scholars to address this topic, Zanoni (2010) argued that the “practicable irrigable acreage,” or PIA, standard used to quantify tribal reserved water rights is increasingly inequitable in light of climate change and should be replaced by a multi-factor homeland standard that can supply tribes with adequate water for a homeland even under changing climate conditions. Most recently, Hedden-Nicely and Caldwell (2020) argued that climate change requires that tribes be able to re-quantify their water rights as conditions change, requiring the courts to change their current policy of forbidding such re-examination.

Arctic residents possess a multiplicity of experiential and place-based knowledge types that are not grounded in Western scientific paradigms, including Indigenous Knowledge (IK), locally-held or community-based knowledge (LK), land-based knowledge, and practitioner knowledge (Cunsolo Willox et al. 2012; Tengö et al. 2014; Crate et al. 2019). We refer broadly to these as non-Western knowledge types. IK, for example, is grounded in long histories of a people’s interaction with their surroundings, and flexibility to drivers such as climate change is present in relationships with the land (Wenzel 2009; Ford et al. 2015; Abram et al. 2019). Participatory approaches to modelling complex, climate-sensitive processes are, thus, highly applicable to an Arctic context. Increased calls for engagement of IK and LK in climate research cites both the value of non-Western knowledge types for broadening and enriching perspectives on complex climate-related problems, and the importance of ethically engaging Indigenous Peoples and community groups as rightsholders in decision-making (Nakashima et al. 2012; Maynard 2014; Meredith et al. 2019).


Most studies reported engaging with Indigenous and non-Indigenous Peoples in their
participatory processes, which involves engaging with both Western and non-Western
knowledge. This is likely to be due to the presence of multiple autonomous Indigenous
Peoples and community groups in the Arctic, who are increasingly carrying out or commissioning their own research and research agendas, alongside expectations of Western researchers to adhere to protocols such as the duty to consult (Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests) 2004), research agendas developed by Indigenous organisations (Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami 2018), and research funding that is specifically allocated to communities (Peace and Myers 2012).

This review has identified a diversity of approaches being used in the Arctic to engage
participants in modelling climate-sensitive processes. These studies comprise a range of
both degree of participation and ways of engaging with non-Western knowledge types. It
is noteworthy that more participation is not necessarily better participation, nor necessarily
favoured by participants. It is challenging to comment on what is best or most effective
in terms of stage and degree of participation, as this depends on the objectives of the
process and there will likely be different participants or stakeholders with different ideas
of what a successful outcome would be. However, we have identified examples of research
in the Arctic that are successfully implementing highly participatory modelling processes,
while working with and for non-Western knowledge holders in the region.
","Climate change (generic)","","The interaction of climate-related hazards with multiple socioeconomic inequities poses
a profound challenge to society at multiple scales (Gaillard 2010; Tschakert 2012; Watts et al. 2019). The experience of climate change will differ among groups in diverse and unequal
ways, the root causes of which are embedded in development issues (Hewitt 1983; Kelman
et al. 2016). Attempts at understanding and adapting to climate change in the context of
these multiple hazard drivers will need to be sensitive to complexity and context, integrate
diverse local perspectives, and involve deliberate and transformative change to existing
power structures underlying these inequities (O’Brien 2012; Tschakert et al. 2013; van Bruggen et al. 2019; Ford et al. 2020).
It is increasingly understood that the knowledge required for this must include diverse
perspectives and modes of production (Dilling and Lemos 2011). In climate research, positivist forms of knowledge have previously been prioritised at the expense of experiential
knowledge, which can result in the creation of knowledge both detached from its local context and embedded in Western scientific epistemologies that are shaped by histories of colonisation (Conway et al. 2019). Engaging citizens and rightsholders in research and
decision-making is one way to challenge these in-grained hierarchies of knowledge and
their problematic manifestations in the creation of knowledge relevant to climate change
(Sawatzky et al. 2018; Kipp et al. 2019; van Bavel et al. 2020). Participatory processes, including collaborative, co-productive, and cross-cultural methods for knowledge production, can provide more place-based and contextual nuance to previously positivist climate and environmental modelling processes (Lynam et al. 2007; Nakashima et al. 2012; Alshaikh 2013; Crate et al. 2019; Gotts et al. 2019; Mach et al. 2020).","","","","","","","","","","Complex change","","","FIRST PEOPLES <-> CAN, TRIBAL <-> USA","","The Arctic is undergoing rapid environmental changes, including significant reductions
in sea ice extent and thickness, permafrost thawing, changes to species distributions, and
air temperature increases three times the global average over the past 30 years (Nickels et al. 2005; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018; Meredith et al. 2019). This is taking place in the context of ongoing social, economic, and political processes including colonisation, marginalisation, histories of forced relocations, sedentarisation, residential schooling, and cultural assimilation (Furgal and Seguin 2006; AMAP 2017, 2018). The Arctic is, thus, understandably the site of a significant amount of climate modelling research (Hua et al. 2012; Ford et al. 2014).

Increased calls for engagement of IK and LK in climate research cites both the value of
non-Western knowledge types for broadening and enriching perspectives on complex
climate-related problems, and the importance of ethically engaging Indigenous Peoples
and community groups as rightsholders in decision-making (Nakashima et al. 2012;

To effectively overcome these challenges, it's important to appreciate the complexity of local contexts, bring in a range of perspectives, and rethink existing power structures.

In the Arctic, a variety of stakeholders, including Indigenous communities, are key to understanding the processes affected by climate change. Indigenous Knowledge (IK) and community-based knowledge provide valuable viewpoints that go hand-in-hand with traditional scientific methods. Engaging Indigenous Peoples in decision-making is essential for well-rounded solutions.

Participatory modeling methods can improve our understanding of climate issues by integrating these diverse forms of knowledge. This approach can lead to more tailored and thoughtful climate solutions. The review highlights different participatory strategies used in Arctic studies that actively involve participants in modeling climate-sensitive processes, showcasing various levels of involvement and the integration of non-Western knowledge.","Yes","participatory approaches in modelling research to explore a climate-sensitive process in an Arctic","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","General - Indigenous people in the Artic","focus of the review paper","no","Transboundary very general, and it did not mention biodiversity (changes in biodiversity).",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

With reference to water resource management, particular attention must be paid to the principles of the “UN Convention on the Law of the non-navigational uses of the international watercourses”, adopted by the UN General Assembly (United Nations, 1997).

The development of international water law instruments, as well as UN resolutions which deem access to water and sanitation a human right, the necessity to apply ethical principles to water fields has been evolving in recent decades, – particularly among scholars, NGOs, and policymakers – in order to foster the achievement of basic values such as justice, fairness, common good, and environment respect.


Table 1 Evolution of key-concepts in the water field. 
• Sustainability (Brundtland, 1987) Development based on the rights of future generations and environmental protection 
•	Hydrosolidarity (Falkenmark, 1999) Equitable water allocation among territories, water users and other stakeholders 
•	Integrated Water Resources Management (GWP, 2000) Operational tool in WR management aimed at considering a coordinated management of water, land and related resources 
•	From Potential Conflict to Cooperation Potential (UNESCO, 2003) Political tools for transboundary river basin cooperation aimed at preventing or mitigating water conflicts 
•	Common responsibility of humankind (Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, 2003) Ethical behaviors to guarantee water as basis of life, “integral” to human development and common good and to ecosystem protection 
•	Ecohydrosolidarity (Falkenmark, 2009) Balancing economic efficiency, social equity and survival of the environment

According to the later writings of Falkenmark (2009), the concept of “hydrosolidarity” should be extended to “ecohydrosolidarity”, in order to explicate the necessity of balancing human requirements (including economic efficiency and social equity) and ecosystem needs. Such broader perspective has direct impacts on agricultural sector, because it can help to protect the rural landscapes, to defend biodiversity and to review some agricultural practices in order to reduce impacts on the environment.

Despite the good intentions behind these principles, all the key concepts have their criticisms. Among others, the most controversial points are the following:- Key-concepts express western-world approaches which basically are not oriented toward resolving water problems in other con-texts, particularly in developing countries.- Derive from a top-down approach, which does not adequately consider the participation of stakeholders in the decision-making process.- Can be considered “nirvana principles”, i.e. idealized normative aims of difficult applicability. 

In particular, two ethics must be thought of as driving forces behind specific principles for water: environmental ethic, based on a biocentrism view, – defending the intrinsic value of nature –, and social ethic, which attempts to revise the traditional anthropocentric view, – based on the concept of humankind dominating all creation to his/her exclusive advantage –, including respect for nature, though recognizing the prominence of humankind and the rights of future generations (Rossi, 2009).

Conditions necessary for ethical principles to be applied: First of all, it is of the utmost importance to recognize ethical responsibility for water. Second, ethical responsibility principles have to be founded on a comprehensive approach.
Third, an international governance is required at the trans-national level for the implementation of the goals of hydrosolidarity and sustainable development, according to the proposal of the “Caritas in Veritate” (Pope Benedictus XVI, 2009) of an international authority which aims at guaranteeing human rights in the development of all peoples, while supporting the survival of environment. Fourth, a fair behavior is required particularly concerning governance, management, and uses of water. It is also essential to take into account the necessity of saving energy and

In particular, the applicability of ethical principles requires broadening the responsibility of water governance institutions beyond the water sector to include the conditions necessary for achieving global water and food security, through a control of agro-food business system which is managing a great part of the virtual water “flows”

In particular, population growth and climate change may have a considerable impact on agricultural water management goal of ensuring enough food for world’s population.

One major concern is that they often come from a top-down approach that doesn't fully involve local stakeholders in the decision-making process. It's essential to consider two key ethical perspectives when thinking about water management: the environmental ethic, which values nature for its own sake, and the social ethic, this perspective promotes respect for nature while acknowledging the importance of humanity and the rights of future generations. 
Additionally, it’s important for water governance organizations to broaden their responsibilities beyond just water management and focus on achieving global water and food security, which includes the agro-food business system that plays a significant role in managing water """"flows.""""

Their conclusion:
The ability of species to persist in the long term is highly dependent on their geographical range and dispersal ability [20, 24, 119], and traits such as restricted range and ecological specialisation can act synergistically with climate change to increase extinction risk [117]. 

An example:
 The Micronesia forest skink Emoia boettgeri is endemic to Marshall Islands and has the most limited range of the 11 species of lizards (six geckos, five skinks) found on reef islands of Micronesia [84, 85]. Climate change impacts such as sea level rise, increased storm frequency and intensity, and saltwater intrusion destroy the lizard's critical forest habitat [9]. The restricted area of the coral atolls provides limited opportunities for this species to accommodate any changes in climate (Fig. 3b). The main option available to species on coral atolls is to shift to neighbouring atolls which might have some favourable habitat, but such range shifts are difficult given the vast expense of ocean between islands. Additionally, species from the Emoia genus have an extremely limited capacity for active overwater dispersal, relying mainly on chance events such as rafting on floating debris.

Range expansions are cited for frogs in Papua New Guinea but that is not a US territory.","","","Complex change","","","","","","","","","Nothing was described as having shifted. Rather, the authors outline threats of extinction if range shifts do not happen.

Because space-restricted reef islands preclude range shifts in species whose physiological tolerances have been exceeded, there is significant danger of loss of endemic biodiversity and the consequent loss of evolutionary potential. It is therefore vital to identify climate refugia that could be used for translocations. However, such refugia will have to be selected with care to provide a safe environment for the persistence of endemic species, particularly poorly dispersed ones [131, 132].","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No","","","","",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

","Climate change (generic), Air temperature directional change, Precipitation directional change, Drought","Northern Canada"," Warmer temperature, higher humidity and increased precipitation will facilitate the lifecycle of exotic mosquitoes by supporting larval development and survival and extending adult lifespan, thus increasing overall population size (42–45). Climate change is also expected to influence disease transmission via several mechanisms: • Reducing egg development time in recently-fed adult female mosquitoes, thus reducing the time between blood meals and increasing feeding frequency (42,43,46) • Shortening the extrinsic incubation period, thereby allowing mosquitoes to become infectious faster (42,43,45–48) • Increasing mosquito longevity, enabling infectious mosquitoes to bite more people (44). As temperatures in Canada become milder and humidity and precipitation increase, larger parts of Canada will become climatically suitable for the establishment of some exotic mosquitoes that are currently limited to the tropics and subtropics (3,49,50). Furthermore, as the winters become shorter and summers become longer, the duration of climatic suitability for disease transmission will increase, allowing autochthonous transmission of exotic MBDs for a limited period in some regions of Canada (49). For exotic MBDs that are zoonoses and require an animal reservoir that is currently present in Canada (e.g. Japanese encephalitis), climate change could have further impact on the reservoir such as maintaining and supporting the expansion of natural habitats and prolonging the availability of food sources, thus increasing population size (51,52).

However, it is unclear if this earlier occurrence and abundance of leafhoppers in an environment of suitable plant hosts will also increase phytoplasma acquisition and transmission.","Climate change (generic), Air temperature directional change","","Temperature increases accelerate insect development and the number of generations per year, raising insect metabolic rates and herbivory, especially in those leafhopper species that are better adapted to warmer temperatures, such as E. fabae (Dillon et al. 2010, Maggi et al. 2014, Bahar et al. 2018, Deutsch et al. 2018). Conversely, the association between phytoplasmas and host plants is temperature-dependent, where warmer temperatures accelerate bacterial multiplication, leading to an earlier expression of symptoms and higher chances of transmission by the vector during feeding (Foissac and Wilson 2010, Salar et al. 2013, Maggi et al. 2014, Sabato et al. 2020). Another layer of complexity to consider when studying insect-transmitted pathogens is the arrival of new plant pathogens due to invasive leafhopper invasions. For phytoplasmas, there are several examples of phytoplasma strains belonging to different groups and subgroups moving among distant geographic locations through their vector, such as the phytoplasma associated with maize bushy stunt disease distributed from Argentina to Mexico in correspondence with the distribution of its insect vector, the corn leafhopper Dalbulus maidis (Pérez-López et al. 2016, Foresti et al. 2022).","Increase","","Complex change","","Increase","","","","Complex change","Increase","","","USA -> CAN, CAN -> USA","","Additionally, temperature is the main factor driving Nearctic leafhopper population distribution and size (Plante et al. 2023).

Temperatures in the northeastern U.S. have risen at a rate of 0.25 °C per decade since 1970 and are projected to warm by 2.9–5.3 °C through 2070–2099 (Dukes et al., 2009, Hayhoe et al., 2007). Additionally, the northeastern U.S. is projected to experience an increase in annual precipitation on the order of 7–14% through the end of the century (Hayhoe et al., 2007). Wyka et al. (2017a) reported an increasing trend in the northeastern growing season (April–September) mean temperature and cumulative precipitation from 1950 to 2014, with six years from 2003 to 2014 ranked in the top 10% for annual precipitation on record and four years ranked in the top 10% for mean annual temperature. Modeling of seasonal climatic indices found the cumulative precipitation from May–July was the strongest single predictor variable for WPND outbreak severity of the following year, coinciding with fruiting body development and spore dispersal (Wyka et al., 2017a).

The Kitcisakik Algonquin community of Canada places high value on the ecological restoration of this species on their ancestral land (Asselin, 2015, Uprety et al., 2013), as does the Menominee community of northern Wisconsin (Wood and Dewhurst, 1998). The Iroquoians of the Saint Lawrence Valley considered it a “Tree of Peace” (Quenneville, 2007). Eastern white pine was a key component of daily living such that the resin, bark, wood, and needles were used for construction, food, and medicine (Krochmal et al., 1969). This tree is also an integral part of Native Americans’ traditional stories and myths, and art forms (Asselin, 2015). At the time of European Settlement, eastern white pine trees captured the imagination of many European explorers, naturalists, and writers. Currently, eastern white pine is the state tree of Maine and Michigan, U.S., the provincial tree of Ontario, Canada, and it continues to be an important cultural icon for eastern North American forests (Ontario-MNRF., 2014, USDA-USNA., 2016).","Western societies utilize white pines for logging, it is unclear to what extent Indigenous peoples still have access to their 'cultural keystone species' but it is implied that access is reduced","Warmer temperatures, and in some cases increased precipitation, seems to be driving an increase in fungal pathogen infection in North America. Because the range of white pines cross borders (as do some of the disease vectors), increase parasite densities in one region can impact the whole system.","Yes","Management strategies for decreasing threats to eastern white pine health will improve as more is learned about the system, but presently there are some simple silvicultural recommendations that may increase the resilience of eastern white pine. For example, emphasizing site selection and reducing competition may reduce the tree’s vulnerability to stress agents. Sites should be selected that avoid factors that restrict rooting depth within 30 cm of the surface, such as plow pans and bedrock, to avoid drought-induced mortality (Livingston and Kenefic, 2018 this issue). Sites with excessively drained soils should also be avoided (Munck et al., 2016), as well as sites with better soils favoring hardwood competition (Lancaster and Leak, 1978) or Ribes spp. (Ostry et al., 2010). Because regenerating eastern white pine under a canopy helps reduce the risk of white pine weevil and white pine blister rust, the recommended silvicultural approach of sheltherwood cuts for regenerating eastern white pine (Lancaster and Leak, 1978) on properly selected sites will likely help reduce the risk of future health issues.
Stand densities may also be frequently regulated. At early stages, it is best to maintain dense stands to minimize white pine weevil damage, but then to thin stands as soon as trees reach 6 m in height, according to recommended stocking levels (Katovich and Mielke, 1993, Leak and Lamson, 1999, Seymour, 2007). Intermediate thinning treatments may include removal of poor-vigor trees from lower crown classes (Livingston and Kenefic, 2018 this issue). Thinned stands will increase sunlight and temperature in the canopy, which may decrease moisture and reduce optimal fungal growing conditions for C. pinea and WPND fungi. Another useful management strategy is to harvest in the winter if stands have Caliciopsis canker or WPND to avoid spreading inoculum.","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","itcisakik Algonquin community of Canada, Menominee community of northern Wisconsin,  Iroquoians of the Saint Lawrence Valley, Native Americans (broadly)","Eastern white pine is considered a “cultural keystone species” that greatly shaped the identity of Native American Tribes and European settlers (Uprety et al., 2013).

The Iroquoians of the Saint Lawrence Valley considered it a “Tree of Peace” (Quenneville, 2007). Eastern white pine was a key component of daily living such that the resin, bark, wood, and needles were used for construction, food, and medicine (Krochmal et al., 1969). This tree is also an integral part of Native Americans’ traditional stories and myths, and art forms (Asselin, 2015). At the time of European Settlement, eastern white pine trees captured the imagination of many European explorers, naturalists, and writers. Currently, eastern white pine is the state tree of Maine and Michigan, U.S., the provincial tree of Ontario, Canada, and it continues to be an important cultural icon for eastern North American forests (Ontario-MNRF., 2014, USDA-USNA., 2016).","","",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

ture (Bell et al. 2009) and hatcheries. Flood-related
fish kills may occur for several reasons, but are pre-
dominantly due to low oxygen in flood waters (Idris
et al. 2014)."""" """"Increasing sediment load and potential for contam-

cal cyclones (Chand et al. 2017), and a near doubling
in the frequency of future extreme El Niño and recip-
rocal La Niña events is expected within this century
(Cai et al. 2014, 2015). Wind stress has increased in
some areas, such as the Southern Ocean, and aver-
age winter wave heights have increased in the North
Atlantic (since the 1950s), with a reported trend of 20
cm decade−1 (Rhein et al. 2013). Wind intensification
is more likely to increase at higher latitudes (Syde-
man et al. 2014), which may be linked to stronger
warming trends in polar rather than equatorial
regions (Baumann & Doherty 2013).""""  - """"The increased prevalence of extreme weather
events will affect coastal fishers, associated services,
and infrastructure (IPCC 2007) and can be destruc-
tive to coastal aquaculture operations (Allison et al.
2009, Luening 2013). High winds and waves can
destroy structures used for coastal aquaculture such
as embankments, pond dikes, sluice gates, hatcheries,
electricity poles, and rearing structures (Rah-
man & Hossain 2012). These impacts may not only
occur at the farm level but can impact entire aquacul-
ture sectors.""""

Impacts in Hawaii: Counterintu-
itively, a reduction in wind may also be problematic.
McCoy et al. (2017) provided evidence that reduced
trade winds during an El Niño in Hawaii decreased
surface water mixing, thereby enhancing surface
heating and water column stratification in fish ponds,
ultimately causing hypoxia and mortalities

Freshwater user conflict may also be exacerbated
by climate change. While this has not been clearly
quantified, climate change-mediated reduction in
water supply or quality is apt to compound existing
water stress issues.

As the environment changes, conditions may become
more favourable for nonindigenous hosts, and vec-
tors may be translocated through gradual migration
(Cook et al. 1998) or sudden events, such as storms
(Scheibling & Lauzon-Guay 2010, Buchwald et al.
2015) and tsunamis (Floyd 2016), creating the poten-
tial for novel disease

Nonetheless, Hernandez-Llamas
& Zarain-Herzberg (2011) examined the influence of
hurricane frequency on the economic returns from
shrimp raised in floating cages off the northwest coast
of Mexico by simulating economic returns with and
without the occurrence of hurricanes. They found
that the effect of hurricanes on economic returns is
pronounced, but can be ameliorated partly by using
partial-and-final harvests and by altering grow-out
schedules. While we might expect that more severe
hurricanes in the future would have a negative
impact on economic returns as well, this was not dis-
cussed by the authors.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Statistics indicate that six out of ten infectious diseases arise from animal to human transmission with global prevalence [25]. Such transmissions may occur in urban or rural areas [29].
Zoonotic diseases, such as those spread by mosquitoes and other related vectors, have increased in recent years. The rise in global temperatures has created favorable conditions for breeding specific vectors, especially in poorly developed countries [30]. Additionally, the increased precipitation and parallel flooding conditions in certain areas provide the perfect breeding grounds for vectors. Flooding conditions amplify the possibility of waterborne disease transmission [31].
In Russia, climate change significantly affects the spread of diseases. The increased incidence of zoonotic disease is attributed to fluctuating temperatures, causing prolonged periods of vegetation growth and broadening habitat availability, thereby allowing zoonotic pathogens and related vectors to have more suitable living conditions that promote survival and reproduction. Furthermore, increased temperature is causing the melting of permafrost in the area, leading to the concern that the permafrost degradation will expose ancient human burial sites and result in the revival of vectors that spread deadly infections [32].
Climate change can also influence the geographical distribution of insect spread diseases [33]. Zoonotic viruses previously localized to areas with high temperatures, such as the tropics, have been observed worldwide, having spread to subtropical climates and areas with high altitudes. Climate change has caused temperature changes in various geographical regions, meaning that areas previously free from certain diseases now see rises in infection prevalence. Furthermore, climate change is causing people’s general health to deteriorate, making it easier for zoonotic infection to spread [33], as seen with the Zika and dengue viruses, which are now global threats [34,35]. Additionally, in less developed areas, the increase in droughts and flooding has cut freshwater availability, which causes humans to ingest water contaminated with zoonotic waterborne diseases, such as schistosomiasis [36,37,38].
Aside from this, the changes in climatic conditions have forced pathogens and vectors to develop adaptation mechanisms. Such development has resulted in the diseases becoming resistant to conventional treatments due to their augmented resilience and survival techniques, thus further favoring the spread of infection [32]. In some contexts, changes in climate conditions may help to increase the resistance of microbes, such as bacteria and viruses, making treatment more difficult and contributing to an increase in the disease spread.        Climate change causes variations in temperature, rainfall patterns, and climate disaster incidence, influencing the global population’s transmission of diseases and affecting the transmission rates of various vector-borne diseases [30,31].
Global warming favors the increase of vector-borne diseases, especially in poorly developed countries [30].
The rainfall and flooding increase, in many world regions’ favor, the possibility of waterborne diseases transmission [30].
Climatic changes forced pathogens and vectors to develop adaptation mechanisms facilitating the spread of infections [32].
The avian influenza of 2005 highlighted the interconnected animal, environmental, and human health [25].
The northern regions were not much affected by zoonotic diseases in the past; however, recent evidence suggests that climate change has accelerated the spread of infections in northern countries. For instance, climate change has resulted in the early onset of winters characterized by increased wet conditions, correlated to the increased spread of diseases via the amplified intensity of pathogens rather than increased host abundance or distribution.

Broad changes in temperature, wetness, and vegetation will all affect the prevalence of mosquitoes and the diseases they carry and drive them into entirely new geographic areas. Weather phenomena induced or exacerbated by climate change often coincide with increases in activity of disease vectors. For example, floods are some of the most devastating disasters induced by climate change in terms of physical damage and their ability to activate key disease vectors, such as mosquitos and wastewater exposure. Effectively predicting and monitoring these events is crucial in order to maintain global health.

This applies within a particular country but, given the international nature of climate effects on public health, it also needs to apply globally among countries. Many high income countries have developed common national public health standards but these do not always mesh with those from other countries (52) and many countries still have fragmented public health systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) is the most visible entity involved in global health data collection and its “SCORE” system is one useful approach to assisting member states strengthen health data collection and sharing.

Breeding ranges in Siberia have been described as source locations of HPAI H5N8 viruses migrating westward in 2014 to Europe, causing sizeable outbreaks in poultry and wild birds that have continued to present [6]. Southeast Asian-origin viruses isolated in north-central United States have been shown to move first through Siberia followed by the Alaskan peninsula as an entry point prior to further southward dispersal in North America [6,102]. Northern Pintails and other long-distance migrants have been implicated in the inter-continental migration of IAVs from Eurasia, transmitting to mallards with whom they share breeding habitat in Alaska, prior to ducks driving transmission to other species throughout North America [63,103].

This could include planting and/or regenerating with mixes of both deciduous and coniferous tree species: the phenotypic plasticity of conifers means that they are generally better adapted to drought than broadleaved species (Rohde and Junttila, 2008) while deciduous trees (Brisson and Lev-rault, 2010) are thought to generally return more water to the environment than do conifers (Hasselquist et al.,2010). Systematic surveys of overall tree health should be con-ducted regularly by experienced people. Monitoring activities should be coordinated across all levels of jurisdictional boundaries and results communicated to experts, policy makers, and the public in language they each understand.  Forest health programs already in place must be maintained and funded. Policies and legislation pertinent to all aspects of tree health should be reviewed to ensure that problems can be quickly responded to (Sturrock et al., 2011). Risk assessments and related rating systems are also valuable planning tools and coordination and sharing of these systems would likely be very beneficial to managing disease problems as they emerge. The establishment and maintenance of a diversity of tree species in forests and urban plantings can help them  maintain  resilience  to  mortality  and  the  other adverse effects that may be brought on by diseases and climate change. Other effective mitigation strategies include tree breeding programs that promote genetic diversity, disease resistance and tolerance to environ-mental stresses (Sturrock et al., 2011). Also proposed is the practice of assisted migration (AM), where hu-mans deliberately move tree species and seed sources (populations). Assisted migration is envisioned to be practiced at three increasingly aggressive and ‘riskier’ scales: the first, assisted population migration, involves the  translocation  of  genotypes  within  their  existing range, the second, assisted range expansion, is trans-location just beyond species’ range limits, and the third, assisted long-distance migration, involves translocation over long distances (Winder et al., 2011). Forest man-agers should use AM “within a framework that allows for flexibility, uses best available science and predictive tools, considers risk and uncertainty, and evaluates and monitors results to ensure that unintended consequences are minimal” (Leech et al., 2011).","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No","","","","",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

These 27 fish species would bring with them 83 species of parasites that do not currently exist in the Great Lakes, opening the door for epizootic outbreaks of pathogens in immunologically naïve native fishes (Marcogliese 2001). ;; There is speculation that the recent establishment of 2 species of tropical dragonflies in Florida represents a natural invasion from Cuba and the Bahamas that is related to climate change (Paulson 2001). ;; It is estimated that climate-related range expansion by smallmouth bass in Canada may lead to the loss of over 25,000 populations of minnow species (Cyprinidae) in Ontario (Jackson & Mandrak 2002).;; Establishment of tropical species within the coterminous United States has generally been limited to southern states, but releases of tropical species into open waterways have been recorded throughout North America (Fuller et al. 1999). For example, piranha (Pygocentrus or Serrasalmus) have been recorded in 22 states, and although no populations have become established, areas where overwinter survival is possible may increase with climate warming (Fig. 4). ;; For freshwater fishes changes in the frequency and magnitude of ephemeral conditions may favor species with opportunistic life-history strategies (Olden et al. 2006). In the lower Colorado River, for example, opportunist non-native species, such as the western mosquitofish, guppies, mollies (Poecilia spp.), and red shiners, are likely to increase in distribution and abundance.","","Increase","","","","Increase","Complex change","","","","","","Complex change","","","","","Riparian, Great Lakes, Rivers, Lakes and ponds","","","","","","","","No direction mentioned","","","","No direction mentioned","No direction mentioned","No direction mentioned","","","","No direction mentioned","","","","sport fish; recreation; reservoirs; dams","The likelihood of imminent climate change should make us reflect on current practices that involve intentional stocking of non-native species. For example, butterfly peacock bass (Cichla ocellaris) have been introduced as a sport fish in Florida. The bass are highly piscivorous and there is concern that they could have a negative impact on native fishes (Courtenay 1997). The species was introduced into southern Florida canals based largely on the rationale that cold winter temperatures would prevent it from spreading elsewhere (Shafland 1995). Climate warming may, in fact, eliminate cold winter temperatures as a filter that prevents the butterfly peacock bass from expanding its range in the southern United States.;; Climate change may cause shifts in water development policies that would be detrimental to native biodiversity. Reservoir and canal construction were viewed as a sign of progress during European settlement of North America. In the last few decades, however, the attention has shifted to the negative aspects of reservoirs, and dam removal is now viewed as a sign of ecologically forward thinking. Nevertheless, the pendulum may shift again as policy makers view increased water storage as a necessary option for dealing with water shortages caused by human population growth and exacerbated by climate change (Limerick 2003). Although large reservoirs are rarely constructed in North America now, the area of the United States covered by impoundments continues to increase by about 1% per year, mainly due to construction of small impoundments (Downing et al. 2006). Reservoirs may be promoted as beneficial because they provide water for domestic use and habitat for aquatic organisms. But reservoirs are typically dominated by non-native species, especially fishes stocked for sport fishing (Havel et al. 2005). Construction of new reservoirs or canals will not bode well for conservation of native biodiversity in stream ecosystems under a changing climate.;; here could be an increase in the frequency of escapes from aquaculture and tropical fish farm facilities when rearing ponds overflow during flood events ;; Reservoirs provide recreational opportunities that attract humans from far away; thus, they represent potential hot spots for species invasions","","No direction mentioned","Decrease","","","","","human disease","","","Yes","The U.S. and Canadian governments have implemented an aggressive sea lamprey control program, including the construction of low-head dams to block the upstream spawning migrations of sea lampreys. ;; The primary method used to reduce the spread of non-native species via ballast-water discharge is open-ocean ballast-water exchange. ;; An electrified fish barrier also has been constructed on the Chicago Sanitary and Shipping Canal (Stokstad 2003) to prevent the movement of non-native fish such as bighead carp from the Mississippi River basin into the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, where they could have severe impacts on recreational and commercial fisheries.","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No","","","","Lots of details in here; figure 1 is great",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

In the face of increasing water temperature we would expect a latitudinal retreat in the distribution of coldwater kelp species (e.g., Alaria esculenta) coupled with a poleward expansion by those with warmer water affinities (e.g., Saccharina spp. and Laminaria digitata) across this boundary. Temperature is one of the most important factors controlling the geographic distribution of seaweeds, and their tolerances to high (summer maxima) and low (winter minima) temperatures generally define their biogeographical boundaries (Luning, 1984, van den Hoek and Luning, 1988, van den Hoek et al., 1990, Adey and Steneck, 2001). Moreover, the low dispersal ability of many kelps (Norton, 1992) may limit their ability to “track” large-scale environmental changes.

In a warmer climate, the species’ fundamental habitat would shift to cooler sites at higher elevations and higher latitudes. ","Air temperature variability, Precipitation variability, Drought","","Climatic changes over the next century could significantly affect white pine populations both directly and through influences on bark beetles, blister rust, and other pathogens (Campbell and Carroll 2007; Kliejunas et al. 2009). These complex interactions present serious complications for maintaining the distribution and importance of white pines in western North America. An important constraint on mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine is climate, especially the frequency of severely cold winters and brief warm summers (Campbell and Carroll 2007). In warmer winters, more brood could survive; and, with a sufficiently long season, two generations per year could be produced (Bentz and Schen-Langenheim 2007; Gibson et al. 2008). Although mountain pine beetle already produces two generations per year in sugar pine, the consequence of doubling the reproductive potential in a subalpine forest of whitebark pine rather than a montane forest of sugar pine is not readily apparent.

Changes in timing and duration of warmth and moisture could have major influences on the epidemiology of C. ribicola. By some climate scenarios, summers are drier in the Rocky Mountains but wetter in the Southwest (Bartlein et al. 1997; Kliejunas et al. 2009). As infection of white pine by blister rust requires a cool, moisture-saturated environment, conditions suitable for infection in some regions might be restricted to fewer wet periods in spring or early summer but extended in other regions. Early season infection of pine is common for infestations in the coastal regions of British Columbia (Hunt 2005). In the southern Sierra Nevada, infection of white pine normally coincides with spring rains and summer thunderstorms (Kinloch and Dulitz 1990). A sufficiently long and cool winter is required before Ribes break dormancy and become susceptible telial hosts (see Zambino 2010). Climatic change may also have a major effect on other pathogens such as those causing foliage disease (Kliejunas et al. 2009). For example, if increased warmth was accompanied by increased moisture, defoliation by Dothistroma may lead to widespread mortality, as occurs to lodgepole pine in British Columbia (Woods et al. 2005).","Complex change","Complex change","Complex change","","Complex change","Complex change","Complex change","","","","","","USA <-> MEX, CAN <-> USA","","These complex interactions present serious complications for maintaining the distribution and importance of white pines in western North America. The likelihood of sustaining whitebark pine, even in suitable habitats, is further diminished if populations are small (owing to random events, the Allee effect, see Scherm et al. 2006). An important constraint on mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine is climate, especially the frequency of severely cold winters and brief warm summers (Campbell and Carroll 2007).

","No","Not clearly transboundary","Yes","Good information about how climate change (air, precipitation) will alter watershedd hydrology, flows, run off and pollutants: 

Anticipated future increases in air temperature,changing precipitation patterns, and altered water-shed hydrological processes associated with climatechange will affect pollutant transport in speciﬁcwatershed settings (e.g., physiographic and hydrocli-matic setting, water management, and other humanactivities) (Wear and Greis 2012; Georgakakos et al.2014; USGCRP 2017). In colder/mountainous areasinﬂuenced by snow (e.g., the northern and westernU.S.), warmer air temperatures affect the timing andseasonality of snow and snowmelt, includingincreased winter precipitation in the form of rain asopposed to snow, and snowmelt earlier in the winterand spring. These changes are likely to alter themagnitude and timing of seasonal peak ﬂows, includ-ing runoff peaks earlier in the spring, and decreasesummer low ﬂows (Birsan et al. 2005; Jefferson et al.2008; Ficklin et al. 2013; USEPA 2016a, b; Paul et al.2018). Increases in air temperature also alternutrient biogeochemical cycling, primary productiv-ity, solubility, reaction rates, microorganism sur-vival, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and otherfactors related to water quality (e.g., stratiﬁcation)(Kundzewicz et al. 2008; Chang et al. 2010; Wearand Greis 2012; Coffey et al. 2014; Havens and Paerl2015; USGCRP 2017)

Regionally variable changes in the amount andseasonal timing of precipitation and runoff are alsoanticipated (Melillo et al. 2014). In the U.S., histori-cally wetter regions (e.g., northern and easternregions) are likely to receive increased annual precip-itation with corresponding increases in runoff,whereas historically drier regions (the arid south-west, southern Great Plains, and parts of the south-east) will likely receive less precipitation resulting indecreased runoff (Arnell 2003; Milly et al. 2005;USEPA 2013a). In addition, an increasing frequencyof heavy precipitation events — even in areas thatreceive annual precipitation — and longer dry periodsbetween precipitation events are projected (Preinet al. 2016). These changes will alter the mobilizationand transport of pollutants from upland sources towater bodies (West 2002; Gellis et al. 2003; Jacksonet al. 2005; di Silvio and Basson 2008; Salant et al.2008; Ford et al. 2011; Giorgi et al. 2011; Vose et al.2011; Hancock 2012; IPCC 2012; Ffolliott et al. 2013).Rates of sediment, pathogen (from fecal sources), andnutrient transport typically correlate with precipita-tion and runoff (Jackson et al. 2005; Salant et al.2008

Reducing the risk of climate change impacts onwater quality requires an understanding of vulnera-bilities in different regional and watershed settings,which can provide a starting point for effective, sus-tainable adaptation strategies. The goals of thisreview were to document potential water qualityresponses to future changes in climate, to character-ize future risk to inform management responses, andto identify research needs to ﬁll gaps in our under-standing. In this paper, we focus on potential futureresponses of nutrients, sediment, pathogens, andcyanobacterial blooms. A companion paper (Paulet al. 2018) discusses streamﬂow, water temperature,and salt water intrusion.

Increasingly severe wildfire has burned riparian canopy in transboundary river basins such as the upper Rio Grande, leading to short-term (5 year) impacts on aquatic species including macroinvertibrates and salmonid fishes due to increased water temperatures and altered primary production. Studies in other watersheds have found longer term impacts on aquatic species, including lack of recovery 20 years post-fire. ","Yes","Forest treatments, including prescribed burning and thinning, can be used to increase resilience by generating mosaic landscapes with patches of conifers and early seral forest or grassland (Kalies & Yocom Kent, 2016; Whitney et al., 2016). Mosaic landscapes are more resistant to large, stand-replacing fires and reburns because nonconifers interrupt fuel connectivity (Abella et al., 2007; White & Long, 2019). Because treatment is not feasible at large scales, strategic deployment is important, raising questions about priorities.;; Postfire, active revegetation may help to speed revegetation of uncharacteristically large burns where seed sources have been compromised. Such interventions can slow the transition away from coniferous forests as climate changes and wildfires become larger and more severe (Adams, 2013).;;The ability of animals to adapt to climate warming and changing disturbance regimes can be facilitated by removing barriers (Murphy et al., 2020). For example, fencing that blocks wildlife movements on land (Sitters & Di Stefano, 2020) and poorly designed culverts and crossings that block fish movements in streams (Neville et al., 2009, 2016). Forest restoration (e.g., riparian buffers) or treatments can create corridors that help some species to colonize new habitat following displacement. In freshwater ecosystems, similar restoration options exist for promoting resilience. For example, access to diverse aquatic habitats (e.g., tributaries, floodplains, mainstems) can add resilience to freshwater assemblages against future increases in wildfire size, severity, and frequency (Bisson et al., 2003; Dunham, Rieman, et al., 2003; Millar et al., 2007). Recovery plans for species listed under the US Endangered Species Act recognize this by including spatial diversity and connectivity as two of four criteria required to determine whether distinct population units have recovered (McElhany et al., 2000).;;When ecosystem shifts are inevitable, the risk of faunal extirpations can be minimized by interventions that
slow the rate of transition and by managing fire disturbance to promote negative feedbacks.
If transitions are gradual, species may be able to colonize areas that become newly suitable. This can be facilitated by identifying habitat in fire refuges and removing obstacles that help animals to track them (Meddens et al., 2018; Meigs & Krawchuk, 2018). Forested riparian
corridors play a special role by providing refuge from wildfire for terrestrial wildlife (Pettit & Naiman, 2007) and thermal refuge for aquatic biota (Ebersole et al., 2003; Downing et al., 2021). In some cases, conservation of species may require translocation or other active interventions to establish spatial diversity among weakly linked populations (Stein et al., 2013).

Similarly, a recent meta-analysis found that increased human disturbance decreased spatial niches for a diversity of mammalian species (Tucker et al. 2018). Although fishers and martens were not included in their analysis, effects are likely to be felt by the taxa, as increased disturbance is likely to minimise the potential for martens and fishers to partition space in the face of rapidly decreasing available habitat and space.

Any additional increases in water temperatures, lowering of water levels or increases in salinity are likely to be highly detrimental to most native ®sh species. For example, streams in the southern Great Plains currently have some of the hottest free- ¯owing water on earth, with summer maxima of 38±408C. Native ®shes that survive in these warm waters are already near their lethal thermal limits. Although, some species persist and even reproduce under such harsh conditions, it seems likely that they are already functioning at or near their limits of tolerance, and it is unlikely that these species could adapt, genetically, in a suciently rapid manner to permit their continued existence if directional warming occurs (Matthews and Zimmerman, 1990).;; Many of these native ®sh species are in con®ned habitats and cannot migrate to cooler, less saline waters. Given the east±west orientation of the many tributaries of the main drainages (Matthews, 1988), there is limited access to migratory corridors for ®sh (and associated fauna such as riverine mussels) to reach cooler, northern habitats.

These range from raising awareness of risks and strategies, promoting knowledge transfer, and pressuring corporations to engage in corporate social responsibility or divestment actions, to bringing policy changes, laws and regulations, fostering just energy transitions, energy democracy, and alternative market solutions, and forcing the postponement or cancellation of hydrocarbon activities. These findings complement previous knowledge on the watchdog role grassroots organisations and ENGOs monitor environmental conditions and ensure that polluters do not violate standards (Grant and Vasi, 2016; Madariaga and Allain, 2018; Steger and Drehobl, 2018). More broadly, the findings support and expand previous claims about the importance of ‘governance from below’ and the role of social movements as a recognisable challenge to transnational extractive corporations and ‘business as usual’ in the climate change context (Lemos and Agrawal, 2006; Villamayor-Tomas and García-L´opez, 2018; Scheidel et al., 2020).


Likewise, in several cases in the United States, Argentina, Algeria, and cross-countries studies (Hess, 2019; Hess, 2018; Martinez-Alier et al., 2016; Riffo, 2017), the exhibited regulation and energy democracy were also interconnected. These findings illustrate the interest of applying a ‘cycles’ lens to mobilisation strategies, the co-evolution of social movements and their impact (Oliver and Myers, 2006; Snow and Benford, 1992; Tarrow, 1989; Tilly, 1978; Traugott, 1995).


Last but not least, our findings suggest that indigenous communities, scientists and women’s groups play non-deniable roles within the movements against hydrocarbon activities. A recent report by Oil Change International and Indigenous Environmental Network claimed that more than 700 million metric tons of annual Co2 emissions were prevented by indigenous resistance in the US and Canada (Oil Change International, 2021). This research also indicates the critical role of indigenous people in shaping a future with low carbon emissions. In addition to their role featuring resistance actions, our study illustrates their role as inspirational actors that raise awareness about climate change and justice.
","Climate change (generic)","","The results showed that social movements constrain fossil fuel supplies, support social and political processes needed for climate change mitigation, and potentially avoid emissions through at least ten different contributions. The findings further identified how the specific contributions to staying within the global carbon budget were associated with the different movement strategies and the participation of specific actors, such as indigenous people involved in mobilisations. In this context, scientists, science-policy interface institutions, notably the IPCC, and policymakers, should pay more attention to the contributions of social movements to staying within the global carbon budget. Additionally, the analysis indicates that indigenous participation in movements significantly contributes to limiting fossil fuels; however, the possibility of violent repression is undeniably high. Therefore, the protection of indigenous people’s right to defend their traditional way of life and ancestral lands should be highlighted in climate change mitigation frameworks and pathways to achieve global carbon budget goals.

Firstly, our findings support existing arguments claiming that fossil fuel resistance movements create viable pathways and important political spaces to achieve climate mitigation targets. Moreover, the results yield new evidence that nuances popular assumptions regarding how social movements contribute to decarbonisation.
Secondly, the study provides further evidence for the existing claims that marginalised people, in alliance with other segments of society, contribute to global environmental and climate justice through collective resistance against unsustainable resource use, such as hydrocarbon activities. These alliances are identified in various grassroots movements that include women, indigenous people and minorities, and professional communities to form partnerships across the social spectrum. From a climate justice perspective, participation from vulnerable groups, indigenous people, and movements from the Global South is vital in
shaping more just energy transition pathways and climate change mitigation (Campion, 2021).
","","","","","","","","","","Complex change","","","TRIBAL -> USA","","There is an urgent need for alternative strategies for limiting carbon emissions. The carbon budget concept creates a pathway for linking sustainability science with climate mitigation policymakers and grassroots movements. It enables to quantify the amount of carbon emitted in the atmosphere before the global temperature rises (Lahn, 2020).

strategies, mainly protest and civil disobedience, which was reported
most frequently in relation to this outcome (77%). The term ‘justice
and energy transition’ in the literature has several connotations. These
movements aim to achieve justice by confronting hydrocarbon regimes
from different perspectives: intergenerational justice, justice for
indigenous and tribal peoples, and justice for ethnic minorities. Just
transition thus requires the involvement of the local communities, local
workers and indigenous people directly affected by the projects.
Moreover, justice is pursuable when the activist’s values and responses
towards the hydrocarbon regime are supported by the resistance culture
of a particular group of people who were oppressed or negatively
affected by the hydrocarbon economy.

Moreover, studies based on the global Environmental Justice Atlas (EJAtlas) (P´erez-Rinc´on et al., 2019; Scheidel et al., 2020; Temper et al., 2020) have explored how mobilisations
around fossil fuel conflicts can positively contribute to more just and sustainable transitions.","","The levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere continue to rise, prompting climate activists and environmental justice organizations to protest against the extraction and processing of fossil fuels as a means to mitigate climate change. This study examined how social movements contribute to staying within the global carbon budget through their activism against fossil fuel extraction, processing, and transportation. Indigenous groups are crucial in resisting fossil fuel initiatives, though they often face significant risks of repression (mentioning USA as example). Protecting their rights is essential for effective climate mitigation. The study highlights the impactful role of social movements in reducing emissions and urges scientists, policymakers, and institutions like the IPCC to pay greater attention to these efforts.","No","","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","Last but not least, our findings suggest that indigenous communities,

A recent example of these efforts is the Southern Border Fuels Management Initiative, which was initiated in 2017 to conduct fuel treatments across 1,300 kilometers of Department of the Interior (DOI) lands along the US-Mexico border.7 Despite large investments in fuel treatments, our knowledge about the effectiveness of treatments to reduce fuel loads, mitigate wildfire risk, and improve ecosystem health remains limited;;Importantly, preexisting fuel treatments including livestock grazing,27 prescribed fire alone,28 or prescribed fire in combination with mechanical treatments20,29-33 reduced subsequent wildfire severity, associated declines in productivity and mortality of native species, and enhanced post-wildfire recovery.30 Long-term fuel treatment effects on native species were assessed by Havstad and James,34 who found that native vegetation cover was not influenced by prescribed fire 13 years after the burn treatment application, and by Strom and Fulé,29 who projected that fuel treatments had multidecadal effects on native vegetation structure. These contrasting results can be explained by the recovery time of the species and ecosystems studied.;;Pairing post-fire ecosystem monitoring with measurements that took place in the same area before the wildfire occurred offers a promising method to understand recovery patterns and opportunities for management intervention. Most of the fuel treatment studies we reviewed examined changes to wildfire risk over relatively short periods of time, but long-term monitoring is necessary to assess how the risk profile changes through time and when treatments need to be repeated.99 Studies that assess post-fire linkages between vegetation and wildlife are especially helpful to understand ecosystem-level effects, yet are not abundant in the literature.

Neoliberalism is characterised by antagonism towards state interference and regulation. Governmentality shifts the responsibility for the environment onto the population and citizens are called on to take measures to protect the climate. The people are treated as a population that must be managed by using knowledge and by the interests of political economy (Rutherford, 2007).
In terms of governmentality, the national approaches differ also in terms of interaction with stakeholders. The climate agency in these national communications is very state-centred and top-down based, the only exception in this respect being the Canadian approach. The Canadian approach is based on broad participation by various stakeholders: “Provincial, regional, and municipal governments as well as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are working with the Government of Canada to include climate change as part of their long-term planning processes”. The 2007 report (Canada’s Fourth, 2007, p. 98) emphasises the importance of national cooperation.

Several provinces, territories and even municipalities have begun to develop their own action plans, which support action on adaptation. In this the scientific and political discourses treat the local and indigenous peoples the same way. In the political discourses, the Finns and the Canadians separate the indigenous peoples as vulnerable to climate change impacts. As is stated by the Canadian Third National Communication (2001, p. 105) Canada’s indigenous communities are also vulnerable to climate change: “While adapting to environmental change is integral to the daily lives of northern peoples and a capacity to adapt is part of their livelihood systems, extreme events and unusual fluctuations in temperature can hinder their ability to maintain a subsistence lifestyle and can also create safety hazards”.

In comparison the U.S. (2002, p. 82) concern is restricted to nature only: “Natural ecosystems appear to be the most vulnerable to climate change because generally little can be done to help them adapt to the projected rate and amount of change.” However, also the U.S. national communication concludes that adapting to a changing climate is “inevitable.” The U.S. approach (U.S., 2006, p. 67) is not based on making plans and strategies for adaptation, but instead its report lists various “adaptation options” for different sectors in society, including forestry, water resources etc. It is difficult to assess on the basis of
the report how many and to what extent these options have actually been put into
practice. The U.S. focus seems to be on communication of scientific analyses to
the decision-makers and to a public whose awareness of climate change they have
developed.


In the end, the responsibility of adaptation is left to the indigenous and local populations in the region. This is typical of a neoliberal mode of governmentality making the population an object of governmental intervention. Although, the issue of climate change has emerged on the Arctic political agenda, adaptation plans and measures have not been developed as an area for Arctic cooperation. The analysis shows that first of all, there is no common regional concern emerging for adapting to impacts of climate change in the Arctic. Second, Arctic countries vary greatly in their approaches to planning and implementation of adaptation strategies. Therefore, even though climate change as a topic has emerged on the political agenda of the Arctic council, the development of any common regional approach to support adaptation to climate change impacts in the region is not likely in the near future. In the current neoliberal mode of governmentality of Arctic states, climate change is understood mainly as providing new opportunities for exploitation of the resources in the region and the role of the states is to encourage this development to advance national economic interests.
","Climate change (generic)","","In the Arctic, climate change and its impacts have already been observed and
the region has been defined as vulnerable to the impacts of these changes (IPCC,
1997; IPCC, 2001; ACIA, 2004; IPCC, 2007b). However, within the widely spread
neoliberal discourses, the region is constructed in terms of increased opportunities
for exploitation of the regions’ resources due to climate change. The region around
the North Pole is currently divided between Canada, USA, Russia, Norway and
Denmark, but there are many unsettled issues and disagreements about borders and
boundaries (see the map).

In terms of states, their territories and populations and their security, Arctic countries
are concerned about the impacts of climate change, but in very different ways.
The greatest and broadest concern can be found in Canadian communications on
the impacts of climate change. Canadian reports (Canada’s National, 1994, p. 53)
define climate change and call its impacts on Canada “a cause for serious concern”.
In the 2001 Canadian report this concern is further developed: climate change
could have “serious repercussions on Canada’s natural resources, wildlife habitat,
social and economic systems, and infrastructure, as well as on the health and general
well-being of Canadians” (Canada’s Third National, 2001, p. 3). The 2006
Canadian report confirms its concern with recent examples of extreme weather
events: “Canada’s vulnerability to climate variability and change have been clearly
demonstrated by a number of extreme events in the past few years, including
flooding and landslides triggered by extreme rainfall and snowmelt, storm surges drought, heat waves and associated forest fires” (Canada’s Fourth National, 2007,
p. 153). Canada is also the most prepared among the Arctic states to take action to
adapt. Recognising the growing need for domestic action on adaptation, Canada has
taken steps in the national climate change process to develop a policy framework
for adaptation. The 2001 report notes that “Over the last few years, a consensus has
been building in Canada that the climate is changing and that measures will need to
be taken to adapt to these changes” (Canada’s Third National, 2001, p. 96).

In comparison the U.S. (2002, p. 82) concern is restricted to nature only: “Natural ecosystems appear to be the most vulnerable to climate change because generally little can be done to help them adapt to the projected rate and amount of change.” However, also the U.S. national communication concludes that adapting to a changing climate is “inevitable.” The U.S. approach (U.S., 2006, p. 67) is not based on making plans and strategies for adaptation, but instead its report lists various “adaptation options” for different sectors in society, including forestry, water resources etc. It is difficult to assess on the basis of
the report how many and to what extent these options have actually been put into
practice. The U.S. focus seems to be on communication of scientific analyses to
the decision-makers and to a public whose awareness of climate change they have
developed.

Canada takes a more inclusive approach by involving a wide range of stakeholders. This includes not just provincial and municipal governments, but also NGOs—everyone has a role in climate planning.  Different from US; U.S. approach is primarily focused on nature, and appears to concentrate on communicating scientific analyses to decision-makers and raising public awareness about climate change. Different Arctic nations are taking very different paths and often focus on their own economic interests, like resource extraction, rather than working together on adaptation efforts.

vulnerable to changing environmental conditions. The capacity of communities and
households to respond to these changes (i.e., their adaptive capacity) will determine the
impacts of climate and co-occurring stressors.

We characterized three aspects of the stressors facing communities and households: type, timescale, and impact. Overall, we categorized stressors into seven types, as follows: climate (which encompassed physical stressors), biological, economic, environmental degradation, overfishing, political, and social. Importantly, co-occurring stressors can interact in complex ways in SSF and influence the impacts of climate change on communities and households and their response (Freduah et al. 2019).

Building on the existing adaptive capacity literature, we coded for presence or absence of four broad categories of domains anticipated to influence adaptive capacity: Diversity and Flexibility, Access to Assets, Learning and Knowledge, and Governance and Institutions.

The generality of our framework allows broad application to global SSF and other natural
resource-based fields, however, we recognize that the practical application of the ARC
response at local and regional scales also requires specificity. To aid decision-makers in
moving towards adaptation, we reflect on specific determinants that may be influential at the community and household level.

At the community level, investing in access to infrastructure and access to credit/
aid were reoccurring determinants that helped communities Adapt, particularly to
acute perturbations. However, prior experience is often needed to procure these assets
proactively. We believe that combining the risk perception and learning capacity
determinants of Learning and Knowledge in combination with these assets is critical.
Specifically, the sharing of adaptive behaviors from other SSF that have experienced
similar stressors will facilitate the transfer of knowledge about what, when, and how
to invest in proactive infrastructure or funding sources. This information could be
shared though scenario-planning workshops facilitated by NGOs and local government
to set the stage for adaptation planning, which is also a component of the “room for
autonomous change,” determinant of Diversity and Flexibility.

At the household level, focusing on strengthening collaborations between and among
households and individuals through social capital, a determinant of Governance and Institution may strengthen adaptation to stressors. Strong social networks can be supported in a variety of ways, for example, membership in fisher’s groups can provide services including advocacy for fisher’s rights and access to information. These fisher’s groups can also be used to empower women fishers (determinant of Governance and Institutions) through required quotas in membership and leadership that reflect the SSF regional participation of women fishers and facilitate their involvement in strategic decisions in response to stressors. Focusing on these specific determinants can also bring the variety of experiences and perspectives needed to foster Diversity and Flexibility determinants that is increasing capacity of individuals to selforganize, innovate, and diversify livelihoods.

When communities and households can combine domains to best fit the stressor, impact, and local culture, this can facilitate adapting and prevent reacting or coping. If adaptive capacity is generated through a combination of resource availability and willingness to translate resources into adaptive actions then successful examples from adaptive responses in communities and households that have already faced stressors can provide guidance and vision for paths forward.","Climate change (generic)","","Climate change is affecting communities around the world. Impacts that communities experience from climate perturbations are frequently intertwined with non-climatic stressors (e.g., pollution, overfishing). These co-occurring stressors may exacerbate impacts to individuals, households, communities, and nations. Affected populations must respond to these stressors, therefore understanding how and why they respond, and their ability and willingness to adapt to these changes, is critical for climate adaptation planning.

Many social and ecological impacts resulting from climate change on SSF are already apparent. Coral reef fisheries are highly susceptible to ocean warming that causes coral bleaching (Cinner et al. 2015) while fish populations are migrating poleward, potentially displacing fishermen (Morley et al. 2018). As a result of these changes, scholars, resource-managers, and policy-makers are increasingly looking to coastal communities to understand the lived experience of adaptation. In particular, the notion of adaptive capacity.

While biophysical scientists have made significant progress in forecasting the future impacts of climate change using models, projections, and other top-down approaches, there is a need for bottom-up approaches focused on how individuals, households, and communities are responding to recent climate events and conditions (Conway et al. 2019; Frawley et al. 2019b). When communities and households can combine domains to best fit the stressor, impact, and local culture, this can facilitate adapting and prevent reacting or coping. If adaptive capacity is generated through a combination of resource availability and willingness to translate resources into adaptive actions then successful examples from adaptive responses in communities and households that have already faced stressors can provide guidance and vision for paths forward.

The ability of these communities to navigate variable social and ecological conditions is a defining characteristic that has enabled their long-term persistence (Adger 2016; Ford et al. 2011; Oestreich et al. 2019). When communities and households can combine domains to best fit the stressor, impact, and local culture, this can facilitate adapting and prevent reacting or coping.

","","No direction mentioned","","","","","","","","The study highlights the importance of integrating local solutions with shared learning and resource access to foster adaptive capacity and resilience in the face of climate-related stressors.
Small-scale fisheries (SSF), can boost their ability to adapt to the tricky challenges posed by climate change and related issues.  Communities face a variety of stressors that fall into seven main categories: climate, biological, economic, environmental degradation, overfishing, political, and social.  Here are key domains that help communities adapt:
At the community level, having access to infrastructure and financial support is important for adapting, especially when communities learn from each other's experiences. Workshops and planning sessions run by NGOs and governments can help people get ready for whatever comes their way.
At the household level, building social connections through teamwork, supporting fisher groups, and uplifting women in decision-making roles helps strengthen adaptive capacity. Different experiences and viewpoints lead to better self-organization and innovation.
When communities and households combine their resources and are willing to take action together, they can adapt effectively instead of just reacting to challenges.

The paper includes examples of NIDS implemented in rivers that cross the Canada-US and Mexico-US borders.","Yes","The paper's whole focus was on the management action natural infrastructure in dryland streams (NIDS): we present the novel, evidence-based finding that NIDS can create wetlands in water-scarce riparian zones, with soil organic carbon stock as much as 200 to 1400 Mg C/ha in the top meter of soil. We identify the key restorative ac- tion of NIDS, which is to slow the drainage of water from the landscape such that more of it can infiltrate and be used to facilitate natural physical, chemical, and biological processes in fluvial environments. Specifically, we assert that the rapid drainage of water from such environments can be reversed through the restoration of natural infrastructure that once existed. We then explore how NIDS can be used to restore the natural biogeochemical feedback loops in these systems. We provide examples of how NIDS have been used to restore such feedback loops, the lessons learned from installation of NIDS in the dryland streams of the southwestern United States, how such efforts might be scaled up, and what the implications are for mitigating climate change effects. Our synthesis portrays how restoration using NIDS can support adaptation to and protection from climate-related disturbances and stressors such as drought, water shortages, flooding, heatwaves, dust storms, wildfire, biodiversity losses, and food insecurity.","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes"," Zuni Indian Reservation, New Mexico","For example, understanding the arroyo cycle and the stage (or state) of the channel and upland elements was an important first step for the placement of earthen dams or rock and brush structures at the Zuni Indian Reservation, New Mexico (Gellis, 1998; Gellis et al., 1995). ;; Modern permaculture farmers, water harvesters, and restoration practi- tioners take their cues from indigenous agriculture and have identified ben- efits of slowing flows, composting soil, and recycling water in greenhouses, to increase native biodiversity, food production, and cooling.

Water management issues vary on multiple time scales, from minutes to hours (e.g., flash floods) to years to decades (e.g., drought, desertification). The impact of climate-scale changes on water management may be expressed as changes in the frequency, magnitude, timing, or duration of extreme events ;;   key interactions of the water cycle with the physical climate system, which provides forcing through changes in precipitation, radiation, wind speed, temperature, and humidity, and feedbacks such as changes in evapo- transpiration due to soil moisture limitation and changing radiation budgets due to albedo changes related to snowpack and landcover changes ;; Water system impacts such as floods and droughts are indicated by extreme values of precipitation and streamflow, as well as composite indices that reflect extreme water deficits such as droughts. Within the water system, water use indicators describe the total water used by various sectors including agricultural, industrial, human, and ecological.

This paper focuses on the US, but some points of analysis are on the US-Canada and US-Mexico border. ","Yes","We have recommended a suite of 17 indicators, some developed in collaboration with other technical teams such as Freshwater and Physical Climate. These indicators provide an initial synoptic assessment of the current state, availability, and quality of water in its many forms as well as estimates of changes in the water cycle and management.
Our indicator suite is focused primarily on selected state- and national-scale summaries of annual statistics for data that are collected at much finer spatial and temporal scales. To be most useful for water management, these data need to be able to be stratified by watershed and/ or management units of interest where appropriate. Hence, investment is needed to enable these indicators to be fully scalable and mappable, so that the indicator can be accessed and presented at scales as large as national and scales as small as county/climate division or watershed. Being able to visualize the indicator information at different scales will better enable their use to address issues and answer questions about local-scale changes in the water cycle. Generating gridded datasets from the observations will facilitate this effort.
Beyond the 17 recommended indicators, additional efforts to explore future indicators for soil moisture, snowfall, and evapotranspiration would provide a more complete set of indica- tors for the water cycle. Closing some cross-cutting technical gaps could support enhanced indicators in the future with focused effort by sponsoring agencies. Efforts to address the gaps include merging multi-sensor information and enhanced spatial analysis and display capabilities.","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No","","","","This paper was a product of the U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA)",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Moreover, the rapidity of climate change-induced shifts in habitats and trophic food webs could affect contaminant toxicity by altering exposure pathways and increasing susceptibility of some populations, especially those already under stress ;; Spikes in atrazine concentrations may occur after heavy rain events with concentrations reported in North American rivers at up to 108 µg/L and in the Chesapeake Bay at up to 30 µg/L (Fortin et al., 2008). A 96-hour exposure to atrazine at 5 µg/L impaired osmotic control in F. heteroclitus larvae, with higher prevalence of dehydrated larvae at isoosmotic (15 ppt) and extreme (35 ppt) salinities and hyperhydrated larvae at low salinities of 3 ppt (Fortin et al., 2008). In the absence of atrazine, salinity had no effect on the prevalence of hyper or hypo hydrated fish. In estuarine copepods (E. affinis), high (25 ppt) and low (5 ppt) salinity levels increase mortality in response to high doses of the atrazine;; Glaucous gulls (Larus argentatus) had a higher parasitic nematode infection level that was correlated with PCB and organochlorine pesticide concentrations (Sagerup et al., 2000). In laboratory and field studies, northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) exhibited immune suppression because of DDT or dieldrin exposure (Gilbertson et al., 2003). Harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) exhibited a significant correlation between concentrations of PCBs, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), toxaphene, DDT and its metabolites and thymic atrophy and splenic depletion (Breivik et al., 2004). Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) fed POP-contaminated fish collected from the Bering Sea for 2.5 years had higher body burdens of POPs than seals fed relatively uncontaminated fish, and displayed impaired immune responses including suppression of natural killer cell and specific T-cell activity;; OPs, especially PCBs, DDT, dioxins, and furans, have also been investigated as cofactors contributing to recent mass mortality incidences attributed to morbilliviruses among several marine mammal populations (Burek et al., 2008, Kajiwara et al., 2002, Kuiken et al., 2006). For example, a mass mortality incident of 10,000 Caspian seals (Phoco caspica) in the spring and summer 2000 was attributed primarily to canine distemper virus, and like other incidences, was preceded by an unusually mild winter. Kajiwara et al. (2002) found that POP levels, especially for DDT/DDE and PCBs, were higher in animals collected during the Caspian seal epizootic incident than in earlier collections of healthy individuals, suggesting that these contaminants made animals more susceptible to disease;; climate change may also alter patterns of POP bioaccumulation and biomagnification by altering bottom-up or top-down mechanisms controlling trophic food webs (Braune et al., 2005, Macdonald et al., 2003, Schiedek et al., 2007). Climate change-induced alterations in bottom-up controlling mechanisms, such as altered nutrient and primary production, may lead to the addition or removal of trophic levels (Macdonald et al., 2003). This in turn could shift predators higher or lower in the aquatic food web, leading to a respective increase or reduction of POPs. Top-down alterations in trophic structures elicited by the changing climate, for example, could involve the loss or diminished populations of higher trophic level species leading to consumption further down the food chain and reduced POP biomagnification potential.;; In addition to a potentially diminished immune response, other toxic effects linked to chronic, low level POP exposures may impair organism acclimation to ecosystem alterations (Jenssen, 2006).

Temperature and precipitation, as altered by climate change, are expected to have the largest influence on the partitioning of chemical toxicants.

Most treelines are temperature limited and warmer climate expands the area in which trees are capable of growing. Hence, climate change has been assumed to be the main driver behind this treeline movement. The latest review of treeline studies was published in 2009 by Harsch et al. Since then, a plethora of papers have been published studying local treeline migration.

Assisted range expansion (ARE) moves genetic material a short distance beyond the current range limits of a species. Assisted species migration (ASM) involves translocation a considerable distance beyond current range limits (Williams and Dumroese, 2013).

(Corte et al., 2020) suggest that some provenance trials could be remeasured automatically. Whether automated means are practical for remeasuring old plantations will likely depend on the precision with which provenance and tree locations were originally mapped, as well as our ability to accurately relocate them.;;As far as we know, only three common garden trials have been established in our region for the specific purpose of investigating AM. These are the Assisted Migration Adaptation Trial in British Columbia, the Pacific Northwest, and Montana (O’Neill et al., 2008b), a single-site hardwood trial at Claremont, Ontario (Government of Canada, 2022), and the DREAM project, which was recently established at sites in Wisconsin, USA and Quebec, Canada (Northern Research Station, 2021).","Yes","Sociocultural","knowledge transfer","Data are scattered across many jurisdictions and formats, and some of the oldest data sets may not have been digitized.

Changes in stream flow have occurred in the Yukon River at Whitehorse and on the tributaries of the Stewart, Tanana, Takhini, Salcha, and Porcupine Rivers (Table 1:1.12, 1.13);; Permafrost thaw and consequently a deeper active layer are expected to alter N, P, and SS levels in the Yukon River;; Recent studies on salmon have shown them to carry a parasitic disease known as Ichthyophoniasis that currently threatens their migrations from the Bering Sea up the Yukon River (Kocan et al. 2004).
","Climate change (generic), Air temperature directional change","The Yukon River - headwaters begin in British Columbia (BC) where it flows into the central Yukon curving into Alaska and finally discharging into the Bering Sea","Evidence suggests that freshwater flow from the Arctic’s major rivers is increasing as average air temperatures rise (Peterson et al. 2002). Alterations in flow is one vulnerability associated with climate change that could subsequently alter pH of the Yukon River and its tributaries, influencing the solubility and chemical speciation of the various constituents, particularly metals (Environment Yukon 2011). Moreover, with increasing permafrost thaw, loads of N (organic and inorganic) may increase;; In the interior regions of Alaska, south of the Yukon River, permafrost is warming between 0.3 8C to 1 8C (Osterkamp 2005). These authors report that permafrost warming will increase groundwater runoff consequently altering stream flow. Changes in stream flow have occurred in the Yukon River at Whitehorse and on the tributaries of the Stewart, Tanana, Takhini, Salcha, and Porcupine Rivers (Table 1:1.12, 1.13).;; Dissolved organic C loadings are predicted to change, as northern regions become warmer, permafrost melts, and river and groundwater flows are altered. Striegl et al. (2005, 2007)have predicted that as permafrost thaws DOC yields will initially increase, as meltwater runoff to the Yukon River increases, but as flow paths deepen DOC will be consumed more rapidly in the soil and groundwater. [...] There is agreement that DOC will increase as temperatures warm and flows increase but the persistence of the increase (how long it will occur) is unknown. ;; Permafrost thaw and consequently a deeper active layer are expected to alter N, P, and SS levels in the Yukon River based on conclusions of Guo et al. (2004), Walvoord and Striegl (2007), McLeay et al. (1987), and Dornblaser and Striegl (2009). Suspended sediment concentrations in the Yukon River have increased as water yields have increased (Table 1.18).;; Atmospheric currents are key pathways for long-range transport of contaminants (heavy metals, organic pollutants, radionuclides) from industrial and agricultural sources to Arctic regions (Hinck et al. 2004). Global air transport is an important source of pollutant loadings to the Yukon River basin. Deposition over forming ice creates a storage and transport mechanism to the aquatic system. Typically these contaminants bioaccumulate in organisms and Arctic food chains. Hg, for example, is a key metal transported through the atmosphere to the Yukon and has been quantified in snowmelt and correlated with tissue burdens of Hg in northern pike and longnose sucker (Hinck et al. 2004).;; ","Increase","","","","Increase","","","","Complex change","","Complex change","Changes in permafrost coverage affects groundwater and river flow dynamics and affects biogeochemical loads and can affect the Yukons river productivity through altering C and nutrient cycling also while there are other sources of heavy metals that are cited in this study (mining, military activity etc) global air transport and deposition of contaminants - such as Hg and Toxaphene organic pollutants etc are deposited in the ice - which when it melts brings these pollutants into the water. In this study they don't measure the relative contribution of these due to melting of the ice vs anthropogenic sources. ","CAN -> USA, CAN <-> USA","","Increased SS in rivers have affected Arctic grayling appearance, lowered their food consumption, increased consumption of O2, reduced fish size, and increased susceptibility to contaminants (Table 1.9) (McLeay et al. 1987). Benthic invertebrate studies in the Yukon River have shown that high SS loads increased the abundance of pollution tolerant taxa (Table 1.10) (LePage 2009).;; Deposition over forming ice creates a storage and transport mechanism to the aquatic system. Typically these contaminants bioaccumulate in organisms and Arctic food chains. Hg, for example, is a key metal transported through the atmosphere to the Yukon and has been quantified in snowmelt and correlated with tissue burdens of Hg in northern pike and longnose sucker (Hinck et al. 2004);; Toxaphene was highest in a northern pike and levels approached thresholds (35–900 ng/g) for growth and reproductive failure in freshwater fish. Toxaphene use as a pesticide historically may account for elevated levels although long-range transport may also be a factor.;; Changes in SS concentrations have the potential to impact aquatic life by interfering with fish respiration, surface-prey feeding, spawning site availability, and benthic habitats (McLeay et al. 1987; Dornblaser and Striegl 2009). ;; '' On the pan-Arctic scale, the Yukon River is fundamental to the function of the Bering Sea and Bering Strait ecosystems (Lisitsysn 1969; Opsahl et al. 1999; Hansell et al. 2004). Therefore, impacts to the Yukon River have implications for the circulation and species distribution in the coastal zone of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (an area the size of Massachusetts), and for large-scale fisheries and marine ecosystems in the Bering Sea, Bering Strait, and Arctic Sea. Increases in freshwater runoff are expected to affect ocean stratification, circulation, and global climate processes through the slowing of the thermohaline circulation (Schiller et al. 1997; Weaver et al. 1999; Ottera˚ et al. 2003);; Infected fish suffered reduced swimming stamina and growth and may cause early onset of fatigue in migrating Chinook leading them to die before they reach spawning grounds (Kocan and Hershberger 2006).

For Salmon-  the  increased susceptibility  to diseases increased salmon mortality and migration through reduced swimming stamina and growth and can limit their capacity to reach their spawning grounds. Community composition: Increase SS is leading to increased pollution tolerant taxa. Effect on productivity: Changes in permafrost coverage could be affecting groundwater and river flow dynamics thereby affecting the biogeochemical cycles. Such a change could disturb the Yukon River’s productivity through altering C and nutrient cycling thus altering aquatic habitat since the The Yukon River is oligotrophic, limiting biological growth Guo et al. 2004).

All communities along the river obtain their drinking water from the Yukon River, its tributaries, or related aquifers and lakes (Roach et al. 1993). In some areas, the water is not treated before being consumed (Roach et al. 1993). Therefore, for many Alaska Natives who rely on traditional and customary activities any deleterious changes in water quality could have profound societal impacts (Houser et al. 2001).","","Increase","","","","","","","","Increasing temperatures is melting permafrost and snowpacks and altering water flows (timing, amount) also influencing water quality and biogeochemical cycles that are tied to sediment and levels of nutrients in the rivers.

Various lines of evidence suggest that many NIS may be “poised to prosper” in a rapidly warming world, particularly in aquatic environments 

the re-distribution of Earth’s biota represents one of the most significant and underappreciated consequences of climate change, with numerous implications for human services and ecosystem functioning

The PNW is undergoing rapid climatic change and these trends are projected to continue as temperatures rise over the next century (Stewart et al. 2005; Pederson et al. 2011; Jiang et al. 2018). Simultaneously, human populations are growing quickly in the PNW. Concomitantly, increases in human activity such as international trade and travel, and human-altered environments, which are associated with increased rates of NIS introductions and establishment, are also increasing (Pyšek et al. 2010; Cardador and Blackburn 2019). Not surprisingly, this region is experiencing a proliferation of NIS, particularly in aquatic systems (Fig. 1), with some evidence that expansions are linked to climate-induced changes in temperature and precipitation (Muhlfeld et al. 2014; Al-Chokhachy et al. 2016; Snow et al. 2017). ","Air temperature directional change, Precipitation directional change, River water temperature; hydrology","PNW and surrounds. Some studies cited are in Montanna","Retrospective studies focused on aquatic NIS in the PNW consistently found that climate change has facilitated the spatial expansion of multiple non-native fish species, including rainbow trout, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and carp. While publication bias may exist, only one study reported that climate change did not facilitate the range expansion of a focal aquatic NIS, the zebra mussel (Wilhelm and Adrian 2007). The primary drivers associated with NIS expansion in aquatic ecosystems included increases in water temperature and changes in hydrology. Climate-induced increases in air temperatures and reductions in precipitation increase water temperature (Caissie 2006) and alter streamflow regimes, which can shift the distribution of many aquatic species, particularly cold water species like salmonids (Kovach et al. 2016). These changes can directly affect the growth and survival of salmonid fishes, shift their distributions upstream as streams become too warm to inhabit (Wenger et al. 2011), and in some cases, shift a competitive advantage for a non-native species, as noted in several studies in our review. Several studies indicate that stream temperature increases are exacerbating biotic interactions by facilitating expansion of NIS into native fish habitats. For example, many populations of native cutthroat trout have been displaced from natal habitats through competitive interactions with introduced brook trout, brown trout (S. trutta), and rainbow trout (Wenger et al. 2011). In the Northern Rockies, recent summer temperature increases and decreases in spring precipitation appear to be allowing introduced invasive rainbow trout distributions to expand upstream, thereby enhancing the spread of invasive hybridization with native westslope cutthroat trout populations (Muhlfeld et al. 2014, 2017). Relative to cutthroat trout, rainbow trout prefer warmer temperatures, lower spring flows, and can tolerate greater environmental disturbance (Muhlfeld et al. 2014). Thus, periods of increased temperatures and reduced flows, such as experienced under drought, have probably allowed non-native rainbow trout to proliferate and hybridize with native cutthroat trout populations.

Retrospective empirical research describing climate change impacts on other focal NIS was sparse, but again, multiple studies suggest that climate change has facilitated the expansion of mammals (Snow et al. 2017), insects (Régnière et al. 2009), and plants (Bhattarai and Cronin 2014) through changes in temperature and precipitation regimes. The expansion of wild pigs was best explained by decreasing winter precipitation and decreasing winter and summer temperatures (Snow et al. 2017). Less snow cover allows greater foraging opportunities in one of the most challenging seasons. Gypsy moths have been limited in Canada by summer temperatures and suitable host plants even though initial expansion was rapid (Régnière et al. 2009) and storm events have facilitated colonization events through disturbance (Bhattarai and Cronin 2014). Such events may enhance long-distance dispersal of propagules as well. However, the terrestrial research also points to important complexity, where climate change has both facilitated and restricted the distribution of NIS (Monahan and Tingley 2012; Tobin et al. 2014). For example, summer temperatures could briefly exceed optimal development temperatures and facilitate gypsy moth larval development. However, this temperature effect tipped to lethality if either exposure duration or temperature increased (Tobin et al. 2014). Interestingly, observed patterns in aquatic and terrestrial environments are consistent with findings from a meta-analysis suggesting that climate change may often benefit aquatic NIS, but effects of climate change on terrestrial species will be more complex and context-specific (Sorte et al. 2013).

Sorry to copy so much. This is a good paper that cites a lot of good work.","","","Complex change","","","","","","","","","","USA -> CAN","","Our synthesis revealed that some NIS responded favorably to changes in temperature and precipitation regimes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. However, there was a trend towards stronger responses of NIS expansion in aquatic ecosystems, suggesting that as climate change proceeds aquatic systems may be particularly vulnerable to invasion by NIS (Sorte et al. 2013). The more nuanced responses of terrestrial NIS suggest that understanding fine-scale climatic patterns may be necessary for understanding outcomes. Further, for NIS whose invasion relies on the existence of other species, such as insects with specific host requirements, the response of those other species to climate factors must also be considered. Nonetheless, climate model simulations forecast that the PNW will continue to trend towards warmer drier summers, reduced precipitation and snowpack, reduced summer flows, increased late summer drought, warmer water temperatures, and increased extreme events (e.g., flooding, wildfire, and drought), with important implications for the spread of NIS in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.","","Complex change","Complex change","","","Complex change","Complex change","","","","","","Complex change","","","","","Riparian, Rivers, Lakes and ponds, Temperate forest","","No change (measured)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This paper mentions NCP in the intro but does not follow up in the discussion and does not really talk about NCP when discussing the empirical results from papers.","","","No change (measured)","","","","","","","","air temp/precip/water temp change > change to some limit of invasive species biology > change in population dynamics > increased range/decreased range/changed range","No","does some hand waving but nothing specific","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No","","","","",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Personal preventative measures for reducing pathogen attainment include frequently checking for ticks when outdoors, staying in the center of maintained trails, wearing EPA-approved repellents, wearing light-colored clothing, and tucking one’s pants into their socks [95]. Prevention methods at home include cultivating a tick-free yard space by reducing leaf litter on the ground, removing weeds and bramble that may attract small rodents, creating a mulch barrier between the woods and the yard, and allowing ample sunlight to dry out the yard (reducing moisture for ticks) by regularly mowing and landscaping properly [95]. Host-targeted acaricides also are available to treat rodents and deer through passive topical applications [95]. By reducing hosts, treating hosts for ticks, landscaping to reduce tick abundance, and practicing personal prevention methods, tick-borne pathogen spillover to humans can be reduced.

Additionally, species now distributed in the southern region of North America, including T. spiralis and T. murelli, may also be introduced into higher latitudes as environments become increasingly permissive for agriculture and new zones of contact are established for species of Trichinella circulating in sylvatic and domestic cycles.""""

About Toxocara: """"The present geographic distribution of Toxocara rarely exceeds 60° latitude in North America and the parasite is apparently absent in Greenland. However, T. canis has recently been identified in northern dog populations where it was absent 35 years previously (Jenkins et al., 2011; Salb et al., 2008; Unruh et al., 1973). This is likely due to the movement of southern companion animals into northern communities, coupled with warming temperatures that allow Toxocara eggs to embryonate and to survive for longer periods of time in the environment.""""

About Anisakid nematodes: """"Therefore, climate change could lead to faunal shifts in anisakid nematodes. Furthermore, warmer water will favour the northward migration of pelagic fish, and this may expand the range of anisakids in the North and amplify endemic transmission of Anisakis sp. (Marcogliese, 2001; Perry et al., 2005; Rokicki, 2009).""""

""""Declines in these endemic helminth zoonoses are in part a consequence of changes in dietary preference and availability of processed foods, and the passing of sled dogs as a primary method of transportation in the North. However, some of these declines may be a result of public health messaging and programming, such as the NTPP (Nunavik Trichinellosis Prevention Programme), which screens harvested walrus for trichinellosis prior to consumption, and screening of pregnant Nunavik women for toxoplasmosis (Lavoie et al., 2008; Proulx et al., 2002). Another success story is the impact of regular anthelminthic treatment of dogs on St Lawrence Island, Alaska, which led to significant reductions in prevalence of alveolar hydatid cysts in rodents as an indicator of environmental egg contamination (Rausch et al., 1990b). In many northern and Indigenous communities, however, access to veterinary medical and veterinary public health services remains a challenge (Brook et al., 2010; Jenkins et al., 2011). In addition, evaluation of the success of these interventions is seldom performed and critically needed to motivate funding for and focus on such programmes.""""

""""The most successful approaches have taken into account the undeniable benefits of wildlife as high-quality mainstays of northern diets, and the ongoing challenges of maintaining security and safety of food and water in a remote and harsh environment. Public health interventions for the control of environmentally transmitted parasites include drinking water and sewage treatment, as well as environmental hygiene and dog population control. As true of today as it was 4 decades ago, ‘control of zoonotic diseases in arctic regions can best be achieved through education and improvement of the standard of living, but because some customs change only with difficulty, rapid progress is not to be expected’ (Rausch, 1968).""""","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","""""In total, the human population of the North (using this definition) is approximately 2.5 million people in 8.5 million square kilometres.

Of the total population of Alaska, 17% self-identify as indigenous (including Eskimo/Inuit, Aleut, Alaskan Athabaskan, Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian) (http://laborstats.alaska.gov/pop/estimates/pub/popover.pdf).

In Canada, the functional definition of the North corresponds well with health indicator peer groups E, F, and H as determined by Statistics Canada based on demographic parameters and socioeconomic characteristics. These peer groups include the northern regions of the western provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), the northern territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut), northern Ontario, northern Quebec (Nunavik and the James Bay region), and Labrador. Collectively, the population in these peer groups is about 1.9 million people, representing 5.5% of the entire Canadian population, and is characterised by a high proportion of Indigenous people (First Nations, Metis, and Inuit) (http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-221-x/2011002/regions/hrt4-eng.htm). In Canada, Inuit living in Nunavut, Nunavik (in northern Quebec), and Nunatsiavut (in Labrador) represent 84–90% of the total population in these regions, and 55% of the population in the Inuvialuit region of the Northwest Territories.

","Increase","","","","Increase","","Increase","","Complex change","","","","CAN <-> USA","","Shifting environmental conditions can lead to interacting stresses that may predispose eastern white pine to decline. These changes may result in increased exposure to abiotic stresses that directly impact white pine, such as drought, cold/freeze injury and airborne pollutants. Weakened trees are more susceptible to attack from opportunistic fungal pathogens, of which there are many associated with eastern white pine in the northeast.

Climate change forecasts predict a wetter and warmer climate for the region with temperatures expected to increase for all months while precipitation is expected to increase in every season except summer (Hayhoe et al., 2007, Campbell et al., 2011). These increases should theoretically be positive for plant growth as Luo, 2007, Anderson et al., 2006 determined that trees will have a higher metabolic process which leads to higher biomass accumulation as temperatures rise with coinciding adequate precipitation. However, early defoliation of eastern white pine caused my WPND has been shown to significantly reduce needle biomass throughout the growing season which implies a decreases photosynthetic capacity and overall negative affect on tree development. Due to the long-lived nature of trees and the relatively short generation time of pathogens, it appears that these wetter and warmer springs will favor the reproduction and dispersal of the foliar WPND, over the positive effects on tree development, resulting in repeated defoliations and chronically stressed trees. Such stressed trees are subsequently under increased threat of infection by Armillaria species which are expected to have extended growing seasons due to increases in temperature. Furthermore, the predicted decrease in summer precipitation (Campbell et al., 2011) coupled with increases in temperature could result in water deficits leading to drought stress in eastern white pines which predisposes trees to infection by Caliciopsis and Diplodia canker (Blodgett et al., 1997, Desprez-Loustau et al., 2006, Munck et al., 2009, Munck et al., 2015a).

""""It has been suggested that in cases where defoliation is chronic and severe enough to cause widespread mortality, increased N loss could result through leaching due to soil retention of N becoming inundated (Lovett et al., 2002).

Maintaining adequate stand density will be necessary to reduce stress caused by changing climatic condition and damage from pathogens (Leak and Lamson, 1999). For example, thinning increases climatic resilience of red pine (Magruder et al., 2013). Thinning has also been initially successful at ameliorating foliar symptoms of WPND (McIntire et al., 2018 this issue). Reducing competition will help residual trees to withstand adverse conditions by increasing their access to sunlight and space.

Peoples of the Arctic perceive strong bonds with the natural environment in which they live, a world view that integrates their way 
of life with the ecosystem and the benefits that they derive from it 
(Inuit Circumpolar Council Alaska, 2020). In this special issue, Knopp 
et al. (2022) found that documented Indigenous Knowledge on Arctic 
freshwater biodiversity included greater spatial coverage of fish observations with additional species that were absent in the CBMPFreshwater database. Documented Indigenous Knowledge included 
widespread observations of a number of freshwater habitat shifts, 
such as permafrost thaw and changes to ice on/ice off regimes, consistent with predicted impacts of climate change. Recognising the importance of Indigenous observations and methodologies to monitor 
landscape change, it is important to develop ways of engagement that 
are founded on mutual sharing of knowledge (Wong et al., 2020; Woo 
et al., 2007). Weaving western science and Indigenous Knowledge 
rather than attempting to integrate Indigenous Knowledge into 
western science frameworks recognises both ways of knowing as 
independent and unique, and mobilises the knowledge from both 
systems while retaining that independence (Henri et al., 2021; Tengö 
et al., 2017). However, the engagement of Indigenous communities in 
the design and implementation of monitoring must include adequate 
financial compensation for participants to support their contribution 
of knowledge, time, and land management. Such an approach focuses 
on increasing the capacity for participation and building relationships 
that ensure a respectful collaboration with Indigenous communities

water quality and aquatic life, disrupting food chains and potentially
leading to their accumulation in aquatic organisms (Kazlauskiene ˙ et al.,
2012). These compounds because of their persistency and bio
accumulation can have long-term negative effects on the ecosystem
(Aljerf and AlMasri, 2018), including disrupting the reproductive and
endocrine systems of aquatic wildlife while also altering biodiversity in
these habitats (Wenning and Martello, 2014). The accumulation of POPs
in the food chain not just poses risks, to aquatic species but also affects
higher trophic levels, including humans who consume fish and other
aquatic organisms (Windsor et al., 2017). This highlights the signifi
cance of implementing management and remediation strategies to
reduce the impacts caused by POPs released from landfills into water
environments. Challenges associated with identifying reliable tracers for
MSW landfill leachate are regularly reported. Sediment sampled from
the Laurentian Great Lakes basin contain POPs from legacy release from
industrial point sources and atmospheric deposition but are also
contaminated with current-use POPs and emerging contaminants. The
Laurentian Great Lakes continue to receive large direct inputs of currentuse POPs, namely PBDEs and perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs),
particularly perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic
acid (PFOA). However, the region was, and continues to be, subjected to
intensive industrial pressures (Helm et al., 2011) that can convolute
identification of point source polluters. Wastewater treatment plants are
repeatedly implicated as point sources of POPs transformation products
via effluent into receiving aquatic systems. Parent compound concen
trations are often considered, but further focus is needed to address the
proportion of contamination represented by the transformation
(degradation) compounds (Buszka et al., 2009). Elevated concentrations
of these compounds in southern Ontario are indicative of continued
anthropogenic inputs from the dense populations (Gewurtz et al., 2014),
but are challenging to link to point sources.","USA/Canada Border Regions","","","","","","Decrease","public health","yes. implicitly as risk exposure is likely unequal but this is not explicitly discussed aside from the following: Protective ecosystem health policy requires a better understanding of

The impacts to be considered are nutrient and water availability and temperature. Nutrient and water availability will likely favor and increase the reproductive capacity of the scale as average temperatures begin to rise and winters become milder, providing less robust seasonal checks on population growth and maintenance.

The timing of life history stages (phenology) of many insect species has already been demonstrably advanced by warming temperatures (Harrington et al. 2001; Logan et al. 2003), and there are growing examples of insect distributions extending northward (Parmesan 2006). Accordingly, there are reports of growing damage from some forest pests at the poleward and (or) alpine limits of their historical occurrences (e.g., Jepsen et al. 2008; Lima et al. 2008). Climate change may also affect pest populations through impacts on other organisms within the community. For instance, it is well known that climate can affect concentrations of secondary metabolites and nutrients in plants, with consequences for herbivores (Ayres 1993; Ayres and Lombardero 2000). Also, climate can affect natural enemies of insect pests (Burnett 1949) and ecologically important symbionts (Lombardero et al. 2003; Six and Bentz 2007). 

About pathogens: Direct effects of climate change on forest pathogens are likely to include (i) increased growth and reproduction; (ii) altered propagule dispersal, transmission rates, and infection phenology; and (iii) changes in overwinter survival. Indirect effects may include changes in (i) host nutrient status, resource allocation, and susceptibility to pathogen attack; (ii) distribution, life cycles, or phenology of insect associates or other vectors; (iii) the distribution of primary and alternate hosts; (iv) mismatches between adult tree location and optimal conditions, resulting in tree stress and increased disease susceptibility; and (v) the creation of novel community assemblages or mismatches between locally or regionally co-adapted genotypes that could enhance the potential for virulence. Climate change is almost certain to be a strong driver of evolutionary change in plant and pathogen populations (Harvell et al. 2002). Short generation time among pathogens relative to tree hosts allows a faster genetic response (Hafner et al. 1994; Brasier 2001). In general, introduced pathogens undergoing sustained population growth while encountering novel hosts should exhibit greater potential for rapid evolutionary response to changing abiotic conditions than native pathogens (Brasier 1995). Additionally, rapid evolution via interspecific hybridization in several fungal pathogens has recently been established, and contact between historically isolated genotypes facilitated by climate-induced range shifts could promote such hybridization (Brasier 2001). 

About invasive plant species: Initially, plant responses to climate change will shift the competitive balance among species within a plant community. Warming will lead to range changes: some expansions, often at colder, northern population boundaries, and some retractions in response to warmer or drier climates.","","Decrease","","","","Increase","Complex change","","","","","","Complex change","","Complex change","","","Boreal forest, Temperate forest","Pinus strobus; Tsuga canadensis; Fagus grandifolia; Adelges tsugae; Malacosoma disstria; Armillaria spp.; Cryptococcus fagisuga; Neonectria spp; Frangula alnus; Celastrus orbiculatus","","Decrease","","","","","","","","","","","","Decrease","","","","","","","forestry industry","It has been suggested that F. alnus may also have economic impacts with detrimental effects on the native white pine (Pinus strobus L.) timber industry in North America.

There is an urgent need for whole-systems modeling of host–pathogen, host–pest, and invasive plants within an ecosystem context to anticipate the range of possible responses of these complex systems. However, such modeling demands a highly detailed understanding of the system.

2. Secondary prevention includes interventions that will prevent harm to human health after adverse exposures occur—that is, after ecosystem disruption has occurred but before significant population health impacts are manifest. Secondary prevention includes activities intended to prevent impacts from secondary exposures such as forest fires and declining water quality. These activities include maintenance of ecosystem services to the degree possible after the ecosystem is disturbed, as well as water treatment and strategies to prevent forest fires. Once pine beetle infestation has affected an area, secondary prevention should aim to control further spread and establishment of the beetle to prevent widespread tree die-off and to minimize ecosystem disruption as a result of the infestation.

Others facilitate transition of forest stands to tree species better adapted to future climates (Fettig et al. 2013b, Millar et al. 2007, Millar and Stephenson 2015). Historically, management has focused on suppression and prevention. Suppression involves short-term tactics designed to reduce current infestations by manipulating insect populations through the use of fire, pesticides (contact and systemic insecticides, microbials [bacteria, viruses, pathogens and nematodes]), insect growth regulators, soaps, and horticultural oils, semiochemicals (chemicals produced by one organism that elicits a response, usually behavioral, in another organisms, e.g., pheromones), sanitation harvests (harvesting currently infested material and destroying living life stages in that material before they emerge), or combinations of these treatments (Coulson and Witter 1984, Fettig and Hilszczański 2015). For suppression to be effective, accurate detection and survey methods are required to identify and delineate infestations prior to treatment. Prevention is designed to reduce the probability and severity of future infestations by manipulating forest conditions through thinning, prescribed burning, or alterations of age classes and species composition. There is considerable support for thinning of conifer forests to 106Disturbance and Sustainability in Forests of the Western United States reduce the severity of bark beetle infestations (Fettig and Hilszczański 2015, Fettig et al. 2007, but see Six et al. 2014).

THere has been a reversal in mercury concentrations in great lakes, Minnesotan lakes, and southeastern lakes, and Ontario Lakes in the mid to late 90s despite regional declines in mercury emissions. 
 These are presumed to come from both global increases in emissions, alterations in food web and metabolic processes, and discharge changes that affect mobilization.  The climate link is for the three latter proceses as well as hypothesized shifts in ocean circulation and other dynamics. The quote from the abstract is useful: """"Trends in fish tissue mercury concentrations in North American lakes with marked overall decreases were reported over the period 1972–2016. These trends are consistent with reported mercury emission declines as well as trends in wet deposition across the U.S. and Canada. More recently, a leveling-off in the rate of decreases or increases in fish
tissue mercury concentrations has been reported. Increased emissions of mercury from global sources beginning between 1990 and 1995, despite a decrease in North American emissions, have been advanced as an explanation for the observed changes in fish tissue trends. In addition to increased atmospheric deposition, the other factors identified to explain the observed mercury increases in the affected fish species include a systematic shift in the food-web structure with the introduction of non-native species, creating a new or expanding role for sediments as a net source for mercury. The influences of climate change have also been identified as contributing factors, including considerations such as increases in temperature (resulting in metabolic changes and higher uptake rates of methylmercury), increased rainfall intensity and
runoff (hydrologic export of organic matter carrying HgII from watersheds to surface water), and water level fluctuations that
alter either the methylation of mercury or the mobilization of monomethylmercury. The primary source of mercury exposure

the present day Holocene or interglacial mode conditions
10 K years ago marks an almost complete shift in variables and
drivers governing the Arctic system. During the Holocene, on
shorter time scales of 1000–100 years, significant changes in high
latitude climate are now becoming apparent in temperature (e.g.
the medieval warm period and little ice age) and perhaps moisture
delivery patterns (e.g., Overpeck et al., 1997). The pace of change
over the past three decades has been even more impressive, with
summer ice extent in 2012 being 54% less than the 1980 benchmark and thickness diminishing by half (Cavalieri and Parkinson,
2012; Barber et al., 2015 and references therein). Associated with
the rapid retreat and thinning of sea ice the water column has
warmed at depths exceeding 800 m owing to warmer waters
entering from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (Polyakov et al.,
2013; Table 2).""""  and """" for the first time in the observational record, sea ice is
retreating on an annual basis past the shelf break, and thus exposing basin waters directly to sunlight and wind forcing. Our rough
calculation suggests that the summer 2012 sea ice retreat left
approximately 40% of the basin area exposed. One consequence
is that upwelling favorable winds can now directly and efficiently
drive shelf-break upwelling, and draw nutrients from subsurface
basin waters onto the shelf (Section 6.3) (Carmack and Chapman,
2003). However, the same upwelling favorable winds will also create onshore pressure gradients over the slope and basin, which will
act to disrupt the flow of waters in the ACBC (see Section 6.3).
Within the basin interior remaining ice is thinner and less compact, and thus more responsive to wind stress (forcing and mixing)
(Kwok et al., 2013).""""    Table 2 summarizes key changes.","Increase","Increase","","Increase","Complex change","Increase","Increase","","Complex change","","","","CAN <-> USA","See table 2 for specifics","Many examples summarized in Table 2.  A few snippets below: 

""""A review of the climate change ‘footprints’ in arctic
ecosystems by Wassmann et al. (2011) gives evidence that all components of the high-latitude marine ecosystem are being impacted
by global change, though most existing reports considered large
mammals and birds only, and mainly in shelf areas.
What, then, do we know? Concrete findings from decade-long
time-series span from declines in sea ice extent and thickness
(Kwok et al., 2009; Stroeve et al., 2012, Barber et al., 2015) to
increasing river discharges (McClelland et al., 2006), with consequences that include the appearance of aragonite-undersaturated
(low pH) waters in the Canada Basin this past decade
(Yamamoto-Kawai et al., 2008, 2011; Table 2). Other changes
include warming of both Atlantic (Polyakov et al., 2011) and Pacific
(Shimada et al., 2006) inflow waters and increased stratification
resulting from both ice melt and increased river inflow (Jackson
et al., 2010). Primary production appears to have increased over
the shelves (Pabi et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2010) but perhaps not
over the basins because of – at least regionally – nutrient limitation
(Tremblay et al., 2011; Codispoti et al., 2013; Matrai and
Appolonio, 2013) along with changes in algal community size
structure with prevalence of small taxa in nutrient-poor basin areas or times (Li et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2012). Knowledge of
long-term patterns of vertical flux and biological observations
above the primary producer level, however, is rudimentary
because of very short time series (Bauerfeind et al., 2009;
Bergmann et al., 2011). The interconnections between physical,
chemical and (lower trophic) biological changes are slowly beginning to be incorporated into pan-Arctic models and clearly document that such connections exist, although they yet need to be
tied to higher tropic levels (Wassmann et al., 2010 and 2015,

Pathways that increase the risk of dengue transmission between the United States and Latin America, as well as between Europe and Asia, have been identified, ranked, and associated with increased geographic distribution of the second dengue vector, Aedes albopictus (Gardner et al., 2012).","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

increased drought and more frequent and severe fires.
Fire can be beneficial for leporids, with reports showing
increased populations following fire events, believed to be
due to increased herbaceous forage and the opening of
habitat; The ability of white-tailed jackrabbits to acclimate to
the season by shifting their lower critical temperature by
178C is likely one of the key factors that has allowed them
to hold such an extensive range across North America
(Rogowitz, 1990). This acclimatization period occurs
during their molting period in spring and autumn when
ambient temperatures reach 58C on average (Rogowitz,
1990). As the planet warms, this adaptation will become
less advantageous, which may allow black-tailed jackrabbits to outcompete white-tailed jackrabbits.

 shelter for other small animals or act as seed pits (Pike and Mitchell, 2013,  Barbar and Lambertucci, 2018).

 Forest disturbances such as pest and disease outbreaks are expected to be exacerbated by the effects of climate change on forest ecosystems worldwide [89, 90] although the exact impact on all host-pathogen interactions remains unclear [173]. In the case of G. abietina, climate change is expected to have different effects in different regions where there is a risk of epidemics occurring. In some areas, it is likely to increase conditions conducive to the development of the fungus, while in others, it will probably limit the spread and growth of the fungus because of high temperatures and low humidity. The complexity of these host-pathogen-environment dynamics makes the outcome of the cascade of interactions precipitated by climate change uncertain [173].

variability on delivery of nitrogen may also be magnified by land use practices. Nitrate tends to build up in soils during dry years, largely as a result of
reduced uptake of soil nutrients by crops, and is
flushed into streams at much larger rates during
subsequent wet years (Goolsby et al. 1999). Wet
years that follow dry years tend to produce the

Halting harvest activities in areas where habitat suitability is

under the most intense climate change scenarios as opposed
to business-as-usual harvest (Fig. 5vi; “BaU”). Reducing harvest
levels was also shown to mitigate climate-induced decreases

strategies to increase the proportion of oldgrowth

mortality regardless of radiative forcing.
These studies demonstrated that forest harvesting is a key
driving force in a caribou–moose–wolf assemblage. Substantially
reducing harvest rates or protecting specific areas mitigated
the loss of old conifer andmixed forests favored by caribou,
irrespective of climate-induced increases in fire activity.
Conversely, high harvest levels coupled with increased fire
activity would increase young, nutrient-rich stands for other

Alaska prohibits the sale of most wildlife hunted by Alaska Natives to non-Alaska Natives, but, across Canada, different jurisdictions recognize different Indigenous rights and responsibilities with respect to disposition of country food. For example, in Nunavut, an Inuk has the right to dispose freely to any person any wildlife lawfully harvested (268). Food exchanges are important because of the nutritional value of the items exchanged, and also because they carry cultural and economic values (53, 269, 270).” ([Keatts et al., 2021, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/PVZXHQ2N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S2QN44SA?page=11&annotation=9ADWGRSE))

“Local sharing of foods can facilitate community zoonotic disease outbreaks (e.g., trichinella or botulism, as noted in Table 2); however, the limited potential for human-to-human transmission of current pathogens spread via sharing, and the low human population density, makes the likelihood of epidemics and pandemics originating from such activities very low. While this traditional way of sharing remains, there also exist other broader networks of sharing practices established to support urban hubs such as Anchorage, and others, across the United States (265, 266).

“Risk for emergence of zoonotic-origin pandemic pathogens from wildlife use in Arctic and boreal biomes is currently minimal, indicating that new policies restricting these traditional and subsistence activities in the name of pandemic prevention would be unfounded at the current time.”

“In general, there has been minimal research on the risks associated with traditional and country food preparation practices, despite awareness of zoonotic pathogens found in harvested wildlife and a clear need for risk reduction (118). Good hygiene during butchering and skinning, and thorough cooking of food can prevent transmission of many of the endemic zoonotic pathogens reported (118).” 

“Ensuring ownership of health initiatives by local communities in general, and specifically in the necessary prioritization process, is essential, with ample evidence demonstrating that failure to engage and build trust with local political and thought leaders, Elders, traditional health workers, and community groups in disease detection and control, will delay both diagnosis and response for emerging diseases (330).

“Rich knowledge, including on preventing certain food-borne illness, results from the long-standing relationships of Indigenous Peoples and local communities with their environment, including their harvesting of nutritionally and spiritually important native plants, fish, and wildlife (56, 57, 118, 339, 340). Indigenous knowledge; the prevention, monitoring, and surveillance of zoonotic agents; and education are considered the most important methods to reduce human health risks associated with the consumption of traditional and country foods (118).”

“In general, parasites, lesions (discoloration, tracts, fungal growths, etc.), or abnormal behavior of hunted animals are often observed by Indigenous and local communities. Indigenous Peoples were some of the first to draw attention to traditional and country food safety concerns related to environmental contaminants, because of changes they detected in quality of the animals and fish they hunted (118).” 
“Recent working groups assessing Unusual Mortality Events (UMEs) for marine mammals and other species around Alaska include Indigenous perspectives and observations (191, 342) and, across Canada, several Indigenous-led Guardians Programs monitor ecological health, maintain cultural sites, and protect sensitive areas and species, while also playing a vital role in creating conservation plans, and supporting Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas (343)” ([

“It is important that the desire to increase awareness of the potential risk of zoonotic infections be balanced with the unintended consequences on other determinants of health. Past experience with poorly designed communication strategies and materials with respect to country and traditional foods, such as contaminants in wild-caught foods, provides stark lessons on the need to avoid provoking unnecessary fear when addressing food safety risk in Indigenous and local communities (71, 72). For example, scientific communication to Nunavut Inuit communities in the late 1980s that women’s breast milk had high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), failed to consider broader understanding of contamination issues in the region, and failed to include the Inuit directly on messaging (72). The resulting alarm and confusion across Inuit and other northern communities led many women to stop breastfeeding, and stopped consumption of country and traditional foods, leading to other more insidious health issues, poor nutrition, and food insecurity (72).” ","Yes","Biotic","Bacterial spread","“The cumulative impacts of environmental and climatic changes may be increasing the susceptibility to the bacteria Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae in certain wild animal host populations, including multiple unusual mortality events of muskoxen in Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, and Alaska, and of moose and caribou in British Columbia (120–122). In addition to the health risk for people who interact with these animals or their environments, there is potential for reduced food security for northern communities, through the direct loss of animals from E. rhusiopathiae (56, 120, 123).”

“The current threat of pandemic zoonotic disease emergence from hunting, consumption, and use of wildlife in the North American Arctic and boreal biomes is low, and policies restricting these traditional and subsistence activities in the name of pandemic prevention would be greatly misplaced. Health threats from endemic zoonotic diseases in northern biomes remain, with plausible hypotheses that environmental alterations from development, and climate change could alter epidemic and pandemic risks.”

“For many Indigenous cultures around the Arctic, wildlife as food, and food sharing, are fundamental components of a cultural value system that emphasizes generosity, reciprocity, and cooperation, and usually operates within networks related to kinship and family social groups within the community (261–267). Alaska prohibits the sale of most wildlife hunted by Alaska Natives to non-Alaska Natives, but, across Canada, different jurisdictions recognize different Indigenous rights and responsibilities with respect to disposition of country food. For example, in Nunavut, an Inuk has the right to dispose freely to any person any wildlife lawfully harvested (268). Food exchanges are important because of the nutritional value of the items exchanged, and also because they carry cultural and economic values (53, 269, 270).” ([Keatts et al., 2021, p. 11

“In Alaska, the introduction of modern materials such as plastic bags, plastic pails and glass jars in the preparation of rendered and aged foods (muktuk and igunaq) actually increased outbreaks of botulism (118). Indigenous and non-Indigenous health professionals promoted the return to traditional methods thereby reducing fatality rates by leveraging knowledge from community members, Elders, and survivors of botulism. Communications and management approaches around zoonotic disease risk from traditional and country foods are better co-developed with Indigenous and other hunting/trapping communities, with mindfulness that hunters and their families are keenly aware of changes in the behavior of wildlife or condition of wildlife products; these foods are usually the most cost-effective and healthy sources of nutrition in northern and remote communities; and country and traditional foods have important cultural, spiritual, and social values to northern communities (355, 356).” ([Keatts et al., 2021, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/PVZXHQ2N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S2QN44SA?page=17&annotation=UPYT22LG))

Yersinia pestis, a bacterium that persists in rodent-flea communities and causes plague in humans, is not yet reported in the Arctic, though it has been identified twice from wildlife in Canada [in bushy-tailed woodrats (Neotoma cinerea) and a Prairie dog (genus Cynomys)] (149), and appears to occur enzootically in southern Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia (150). If warming leads to northern expansion of rodent reservoirs, the disease could affect Arctic and more boreal communities in the future. Northward expansion in mammal ranges are already noted, for example in beavers (Castor canadensis) increasingly colonizing the north. Such expansion impacts zoonotic disease ecology, with beavers, for e.g., capable of carrying tularemia, and amplifying and maintaining Giardia (249). Migratory terrestrial and marine intermediate hosts have been implicated in the introduction of other zoonoses to northern regions. For example, human seroprevalence for the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is high in some parts of the Canadian Arctic, with infection associated with consumption of under-cooked country foods (306). The parasite, thought originally to be of South American origin, but now ubiquitous around the globe, has felids as the only known definitive host. However, seropositive wildlife species have been detected in the Arctic, where wild felids do not occur, and hypotheses for arrival in the region include spread via migratory waterfowl or marine mammal intermediate hosts (306, 307)","Climate change (generic)","","changes in wildlife community dynamics, including range shifts and increasing overlap between marine and terrestrial ecosystems as a result of sea ice loss and other climate-related changes.","Increase","","Complex change","","","","","","","Complex change","","Canada <-> First peoples <-> USA","OTHER - described in above short answer question, specify directionality","","such expansion impacts zoonotic disease ecology","","","","","Increase","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ecosystems (generic), Boreal grassland, Boreal forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Decrease","","","","","","","","","Northward expansion in mammal ranges are already noted, for example in beavers (Castor canadensis) increasingly colonizing the north.

Th is hypothesis was further validated
with the discovery in July 2009 of a kudzu
population in Essex County, Ontario,
Canada (Fig. 19.5). Th e patch, which
measured 50 m  150 m (164 ft  492 ft),
was found on a bluff overlooking Lake Erie
near Leamington, Ontario – a farming
community about 70 km (45 miles) southeast
of Detroit, Michigan. Th is is much
further north than kudzu was ever expected
to grow in North America.

Th e origin of the infestation – whether it
was planted or simply fl oated across Lake
Erie from Ohio – is unknown. However,
according to Rachel Gagnon, Director of the
Ontario Invasive Plant Council, the
infestation is well established but more or
less contained – and is not known to occur
elsewhere in Canada. Rowan Sage, a biology
professor at the University of Toronto, has
recommended that the infestation be
destroyed immediately or ‘the plant could
wind up costing millions of dollars to
eradicate’ (CBC News, 2009).

contained, the discovery of kudzu in Canada
argues strongly in favour of early detection
and rapid response measures in areas likely
to be impacted by climate change (e.g. rapid
warming above winter thresholds).","Increase","","Increase","","","","","","","","","","USA -> CAN","No, it is all in this paper.","Kudzu often grows over, smothers and

cannot be disturbed by digging (as on a

repeatedly with herbicides or cut close to the

crown are exhausted. Late season cutting or
mowing should be followed up, if possible,
with immediate application of a systemic
herbicide (e.g. glyphosate) to the cut stems,
to permit translocation of the chemical into
the root system. Kudzu can be completely
eradicated from any site if the root crowns
are totally killed or removed.

Such external flows would impact the strain on internal systems in the country of origin.","Yes","“Adaptive measures to combat climate change as a major trigger of migration have been developed in various contexts. However, their comprehensive implementation in the Global South is hindered by socioeconomic factors114. For example, in regions where farmers rely on agriculture, the high cost of implementing relevant adaptation strategies is prohibitive due to the low socioeconomic status and income of the population85. Migration becomes a personal adaptation strategy when adapting in place is no longer an option119.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=JGAL2C8E))

“However, due to the expenses and resource requirements of migration, individuals and families with limited means may be unable to relocate, forcing them to face the challenges of climate change involuntarily123. Some individuals will choose to face these challenges due to their cultural ties to the land and community124, while others may seek opportunities in nearby cities as an alternative for livelihood generation90,111. The lack of adaptive strategies, especially among individuals of low socioeconomic status, makes them particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to a lack of assets, knowledge, and networks125. Therefore, as the risks of climate change intensify, there is a growing need to provide support for households that have made the decision to migrate, as well as to implement adaptation strategies for those who are unable or choose not to relocate13.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=I7YNES4Y))

“One intervention that governments can employ to assist communities in coping with climate migration is the relocation of affected people to better and more habitable locations41,44. People living in areas affected by droughts, limited water resources, or frequent floods in low-lying areas should be relocated to areas with sufficient water or minimal flood risk126. However, relocation requires resources and should be adequately planned with input from affected populations to avoid unanticipated challenges125,127. Previous relocations have failed due to loss of livelihood, cultural heritage, and social networks, often resulting in abject poverty for the relocated people123. Governments must strive to provide sources of livelihood for the relocated communities, although many developing countries struggle to implement such actions due to limited resources122.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=JEEHTHEC))

“Various initiatives have been launched to address international migration caused by climate change, such as the Task Force on Displacement, the Global Compact for Migration, the UN Network on Migration, the Kampala Convention, and the Cancun Adaptation Framework. While their direct focus on climate change varies, each has contributed to highlighting climate change as a fundamental driver of migration that must be promptly addressed128. For instance, under the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of the Paris Agreement, mobility has been conceptualized as a strategy for adaptation. Most recently, the Nansen Initiative, which evolved into the Platform for Disaster Displacement, has specifically aimed to address the needs of cross-border migrants displaced by natural disasters129. These initiatives encourage countries to commit to addressing the adverse effects of climate change on migrants and establish measures to acknowledge migration due to climate change, plan relocations, and promote collaboration to mitigate associated challenges120,130.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=XENN769W))

“Researchers have also advocated for social protection measures to manage climate migration, supporting people who choose to stay in their communities to maintain their livelihoods, and addressing the drivers of migration that force people to engage in maladaptive migration132. However, until recently, there has been limited cooperation between countries in the Global South concerning fostering safe migration or safeguarding the rights of climate migrants in receiving areas25.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=3C9WPI4I))

“Therefore, it is essential to identify localities at risk of depopulation to effectively coordinate migration and relocation. Potential relocation areas for displaced individuals must be extensively assessed to ensure they can sustain increased populations without further hardships. Countries must share the responsibility of planning, identifying suitable relocation areas, and providing support to relocated individuals in host societies118. Additionally, collaboration between origin and destination countries is crucial for planning future climate change-induced migration in a way that benefits both nations109.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=LIP4HMR5))

“public-private partnerships, philanthropic donors, and international organizations should establish and provide increased support to people living in areas prone to sea-level rise, flooding, and drought. This support should also extend to those who have limited financial and adaptive resources to avert prolonged displacement and migration19. However, developing countries must still take prompt actions and measures to combat climate change and its effects, and consider climate-induced migration a critical problem that must be addressed immediately within their countries and regions117.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=XZJPNAE3))

“Finally, the development and implementation of measures such as long-term planning, effective strategies for absorption of shocks and rapid recovery, and innovative adaptation solutions can contribute to enhancing the resilience of communities and avoiding the negative impacts of migration42,107. Strengthening planning, absorption, recovery, and adaptation capacities requires concerted efforts across different sectors44,79. These efforts should include upgrading infrastructure systems and increasing their resilience108, improving household economic capacities29,88, enhancing the efficiency of resource consumption and production25,99, engaging local communities in planning and decisionmaking processes118,134, utilizing modeling and scenario-making techniques for planning under different future scenarios, and employing smart solutions such as early warning systems to facilitate better response and absorption capacities136,137.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=2S3HIBGM))","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No","","","","Another potential socioeconomic flow is mentioned at the very end of the solutions section, which is transboundary cooperation and collaboration for migration-preventing climate adaptation (tech transfer and financial support).
