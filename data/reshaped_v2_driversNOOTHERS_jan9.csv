unexpected limits to the gypsy moth range edge. For example, the patterns of range edge dynamics in eastern Virginia, characterized by overall
stasis and range retraction with high temporal variability (Figure 3), were
unexpected given the suitability of winter climate in the southeastern
United States for gypsy moth. Spread rates in this region were found

the implementation of the STS programme as the lead initiative for

Event effects have driven considerable changes in a variety of ecosystems and biological compartments, spanning from soil microbiota (Fierer & Schimel, 2002), to meadow- dwelling insects (Piessens et al., 2009), to fish foraging in coral reefs (Stuart-Smith et al., 2021; Richardson et al., 2018). In rivers, abrupt changes in water flow and temperature directly affect the habitat extent and suitability for organisms as they cause rapid variations in hydraulic and chemical con- ditions (Guse et al., 2015; Petrovic et al., 2011; Ponsatí et al., 2015). These variations challenge the adaptability of many species, with potential effects on the composition, diversity, and abundance of biological communities. Our results show that such effects differ for different biological compartments, with some being more vulnerable than others.
Our synthesis of the available evidence reveals that river biota do not exhibit consistent responses to extreme events. While the species richness and biomass of invertebrates were consistently negatively affected by water flow interruption, microbial communities showed inconsistent responses, rang- ing from non-significant effects for benthic algal (biofilm) bio- mass to decreases for fungal biomass.;; In contrast to interruptions in water flow, floods did not show consistent impacts on either species richness or biomass. While flood events may lead to losses of algae and macroin- vertebrates via physical disturbance and washout (the scour- ing effect; Feeley et al., 2012) and cause important changes in the geomorphological structure of rivers, they do not nec- essarily affect all taxonomic groups similarly (Piniewski et al., 2017).;; Contrasting with responses in biodiversity, the ecosystem functions of rivers did not exhibit consistent, negative responses to weather variability. Only primary productivity exhibited a negative response to event effects, largely due to a negative response to extreme water flow decreases.

There also appears to be a consensus that increasing mean temperatures are correlated with, and are thought to be a cause of, increased water stress. As temperatures rise, water stress may result from less water, increases in evaporation, and increases in agricultural water demand. But the link between temperature and water stress is not unique to drought. Recent papers demonstrate that a combination of higher temperatures and rainfall extremes are correlated with increases in migration rates away from areas where these changes can be observed. This being said, the causal interaction of temperature, water stress and migration is still not clearly understood.

“In some cases, a reduction in effective rainfall and/or loss of access to irrigation water and other ecosystem services can render an existing livelihood inoperable, thus making the search for alternative livelihood necessary. The search for alternative livelihoods may or may not entail migration. One of the most compelling findings emerging from recent research is that in dryland agricultural areas increased surface temperature extremes and variability have an influence on migration (Cattaneo and Peri, 2016). It appears that extreme and long-lasting rises in temperature can increase the frequency of long dry spells (droughts), which in turn increase the frequency of crop failure and, as a result, can increase out-migration from agriculturally dependent societies (Gray and Mueller, 2012; Henry et al., 2004; Cai et al., 2017).”

“Virtually every study included in this literature review concluded that migration within specific life stages is common and that, to a large degree, migration patterns can be explained by global economic development as well as social and demographic changes in recent decades. These studies, however, show that there are clear instances in which novel conditions of water stress affect livelihood expectations, destroy assets and alter rates at which people change residences on a temporary, seasonal, cyclical or permanent basis.”

“In general, water stresses such as drought, dry spells, changing rainfall variability and extremes that result in declining smallholder and subsistence agricultural production may accelerate or amplify migration patterns (e.g. Nawrotski and Bakhtsiyarava, 2017; Cai et al., 2016).”

Examples of the above are given for Mexico -> USA. Canada is also mentioned, but in a context that makes it unclear whether the migration is internal or transboundary.

“extreme droughts contributed to migration from Mexico to the United States. Long-established migrant communities tended to originate from areas historically affected by drought, whereas new migrant communities originated from areas affected by more recent drought.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=21&annotation=NKJP3BTT))

“In another study, droughts in Mexico were related to migration in both wet and dry climates, and although drought drove migration in both contexts, in wetter climates social networks remained a stronger determinant in the decision to migrate (Nawrotski and Hunter, 2013).” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=21&annotation=B88PHM2W))

“This review finds that by controlling for multiple hazards, heat exposure can be identified as a stronger predictor of migration than drought, increasing climate variability or extreme rainfall and flooding. Heat amplifies the potential for migration across a range of water stresses. This has been shown to be the case in country-level studies in Pakistan (Mueller et al., 2014), Indonesia (Bohra-Mishra et al., 2016), the Philippines (Bohra-Mishra et al., 2017), Mexico (Nawrotski et al., 2015, 2016), West Africa (Nawrotski and Bakhtsiyarava, 2016) and South Africa (Mastorillo et al., 2016), as well as global comparative studies (see Cai et al., 2016). Bohra-Mishra et al. 2014, 2016) found that in Indonesia and the Philippines, anomalously high temperatures amplified the migration effect of both drought and extreme rainfall. Significantly, migration responses to heat are non-linear and changes in migration are observed beyond specific temperature thresholds in the form of extreme temperatures (see Cai et al., 2016) as well as long-lasting temperatures (see Nawrotski et al., 2017)... One potential explanation is that extreme or sustained heat increases evaporation and decreases the water content of the topsoil to the detriment of shallow root crops commonly associated with subsistence agricultural production. This phenomenon would explain migration as a response to water shortages, as well, when water storage does not meet agricultural water demands. Another potential explanation is that heat is a variable that can be measured and evaluated comparatively, while drought declaration procedures involve a host of sociopolitical as well as biophysical considerations.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=22&annotation=4ZBZKHQL))

“Nawrotski et al. (2017) observed that, in Mexico, once a threshold of ~34 heat months (months in which the maximum temperature was more than 1 standard deviation above the 1951-1980 reference period) was surpassed, the relationship between heat months and the rate of rural-urban migration became positive and progressively strengthened.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=22&annotation=DT97IQFP))

An important note on short-term hazards: “recent consensus has emerged in the literature around the finding that impacts of catastrophic flooding on homes or assets are much weaker predictors of permanent migration. Studies from a variety of contexts show that flooding and disaster have modest or only short-term effects on migration (Gray and Mueller, 2012; Lu et al., 2016)” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=21&annotation=8JN2USQE))

“One finding from relatively early work by Munshi et al. (2003) is common in many contexts. The authors found that extreme droughts contributed to migration from Mexico to the United States. Long-established migrant communities tended to originate from areas historically affected by drought, whereas new migrant communities originated from areas affected by more recent drought. It is noteworthy that migrants were found to follow existing patterns of migration that had been established earlier and independently of drought. In other words, migrants whose decisions were related to drought followed in the footsteps of previous migrants. These findings are echoed throughout the literature; migrant networks and corridors are not new, and when water stress drives new patterns of migration, they usually fold into existing spatial, temporal, seasonal and economic patterns of migration. Migration is completely normal, and environmental stress can be one driver among many (Black et al., 2011a).” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=21&annotation=NKJP3BTT))","MEX -> USA","Nawrotski and Hunter 2013; Feng et al 2010; Nawrotski et al 2015; Nawrotski et al 2017;Munshi 2003; poor citations in paper make it difficult to identify exact papers","“Several papers conclude that migration can produce water stress through impacts to ecosystem services that support water provisioning, water distribution systems, flood management systems and safe drinking water (Selby and Hoffman 2012; Biswas and Quiroz, 1996; Jacobsen, 1997; McMichael et al., 2012; Talozi et al., 2015; Chatterjee, 2010; Metulini et al., 2016; Rufola et al., 2015; Black, 1994; Mbonile, 2005; Wiesmann, 2000).

Different people migrate differently in response to drought and water-supply stress (Curran, 2002; Henry et al., 2004). Men and women may migrate differently, as may elderly and young people, and relatively wealthy and poor people. Whatever the population, responsiveness that may result in migration is dependent on the complex cultural, political and environmental context in which decisions are made (see Black et al., 2011a). Concerningly, in recent years, empirical research has identified populations that are unwilling or unable to engage in labour migration (see Adams, 2016). The capacity to migrate of these populations may be eroding gradually over time, increasing the likelihood of a humanitarian crisis and the need for sustained, high-level interventions (see Black et al., 2011a).”","Increasing incidence of drought and extreme temperatures can lead to increased rates of transboundary migration.

Typically, these articles identify a case for investment in sustainable agriculture and rural livelihood diversification. In waterstressed areas, experience suggests that such policies and programmes can both slow rural-urban migration and reduce the incentive for people to attempt to move across international borders out of desperation rather than out of choice.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. ix](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=11&annotation=9ZZKK8AN))

“There is also a dearth of knowledge about the influence of investments that alleviate water stress on migration – especially in areas dominated by irrigated agriculture. Studies in multiple contexts imply that public investments in rural agriculture adaptation could attenuate rapid rural-urban migration (Nawrotski et al., 2017). These findings indicate that rural adaptation measures may deserve greater attention as a means to create opportunities and reduce vulnerability to climate stresses and shocks so that people do not feel forced to abandon their agricultural land. More comprehensive assessments of the impacts of adaptation interventions on forms of forced migration, such as forced displacement, could help policy-makers understand the value of public expenditures towards rural economic diversification. To this end, more research is needed on the effect of rural agriculture adaptation policies on migration, and the effect of migration on coordinated adaptation. Adaptive policies and programmes that might be of assistance include: land tenure reforms; development of robust water-sharing systems; development of drought-resistant crop varieties; crop insurance mechanisms; and other measures to buffer the impact of repeated losses associated with water stress.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=14&annotation=CTMW9LYM))

“Among multilateral international institutions, the policy problems associated with environment-related migration have been addressed primarily by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which has focused on cross-border labour migration issues, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has focused on the potential for population displacement across borders as a result of climate change.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=15&annotation=JABH3B3S))

“While there is no legal category guaranteeing special protections for environmental migrants (i.e. “climate refugees”), the IOM formally defined “environmental migrants” in the UNFCCC (2007) as “persons or groups of persons who, for reasons of sudden or progressive changes in the environment that adversely affect their lives or living conditions, are obliged to have to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move either within their territory or abroad"""" (pp. 1-2)” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=15&annotation=DPL3V7F8))

“Universally, the literature emphasizes the strong mediating role of institutions and policy on the water stress-migration link. On the one hand, vulnerabilities to water stress that lead to migration can be associated with a legacy of planning decisions with long histories, or may result from short-term institutional failures. For example, the patterns of catastrophic flooding in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, which produced large-scale migration, was a result of the failure of a complex history of flood management decisions and zoning by federal, state and local authorities (see Fussell et al., 2014). On the other hand, effective and timely drought and flood responses have been shown to mitigate the incentive for people to migrate. For example, Marchildon et al. (2008) have shown that drought incidence is associated with out-migration in rural Canada, except in places where government relief programmes have mitigated the negative consequences of drought. Such findings highlight the effects of intervention in ameliorating the environmental drivers of migration.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=24))

“A handful of articles have shown that policies that are ill-conceived or unresponsive to migrant needs can exacerbate friction between impoverished migrants and the community that hosts them. For example, Bhavanani and Lacina (2015) investigated the Sons of the Soil movement in India, in which migrants (moving in part due to drought) have been implicated in destructive riots. They find that inclusive host communities with access to the resources necessary to accommodate migrants can resolve social conflicts more efficiently than host communities without sufficient resources to accommodate migrant needs. Without sufficient resources, relationships between hosts and migrants can fray. While this is only one case study, it highlights a causal pathway where natural disasters and, possibly, adverse climate change impacts in one area can lead to violence in another.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=29))

“Migration is usually a delayed response to water stress and its emergence in data sets is even more delayed. Findings from various papers indicated that migration likelihood is low immediately after a water shock, but increases as households cycle through the various in situ adaptation strategies available. If the shock is not repeated for an extended period of time (as illustrated in Mexico; see Nawrotski et al., 2015) then migration rates stabilize. This suggests that households can successfully adapt in situ to a one-time incidence of water shock.” ([Wrathall et al., 2018, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/CIYI3PZB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P223SPYV?page=33&annotation=THSNM2AC))

“Climate change poses risks to communities and livelihoods via impacts on ecosystem “goods and services,” loss of arable land, and increased severity and frequency of climate related disasters (OliverSmith 2009). These impacts may cause people to turn increasingly to migration as an adaptive strategy (Black 2001; Castles 2002; Renaud et al. 2007). However, climate change will not act alone in shaping population movement; rather, “it produces environmental effects and exacerbates current vulnerabilities that make it difficult for people to survive where they are” [International Organisation for Migration (IOM) 2009]. For less developed countries in particular, social, demographic, political, and economic stressors—such as high population density, limited economic opportunity, inequitable distribution of resources and ser vices, poor urban and land use planning, and armed conflict—will coexist with climate risks and influence migration decisions (Tacoli 2009). Hence, disaggregating the impacts of climate change from those of other processes is difficult, particularly slow onset environ mental changes (Adamo 2010).” ([McMichael et al., 2012, p. 647](zotero://select/library/items/ULVSWDCU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2888YDQ2?page=2&annotation=YEBRGZRK))

In 2009, Indigenous peoples from every continent gathered at the Indigenous Peoples Global Summit on Climate Change in Anchorage, Alaska, following the 2007 release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. Many representatives felt their voices were not adequately represented during this multilateral report from the United Nations (UN). Therefore, the Anchorage gathering was to prepare a declaration of climate crisis and call to action for the UN and future IPCC reports (Martinez 2012). Much of the existing climate change literature reflects the approach of Western science, which uses a knowledge base built on assumptions of human ownership of the environment rather than a communing bond reflected in many Indigenous cultures (Armstrong 2012). Therefore, the Anchorage Declaration states that any future intergovernmental climate change agreements must reflect the principles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

Such studies highlight the diversity of community adaptation and resilience strategies used by communities to respond to and understand community perspectives of climate change and its associated threats (Hissa 2016; Bulla and Steelman 2016).

Indeed, several economic models project that global warming will have more effects on the distribution of farm production rather than on global farm output (Darwin et al., 1995; World Bank, 2008: 16-17).

Numerous ice-dependent species, including polar bears, walrus, seals and Adelie penguins are either threatened with extinction or increasingly vulnerable due to reductions in their ice habitat.19 Warming ocean temperatures, decreasing salinity due to sea ice melt and increasing ocean acidification due to excess CO2 absorption are also affecting other species. Krill, the foundation of the Antarctic food chain, are reported to be disappearing from their traditional spawning grounds20 and evidence is emerging of geographical shifts in populations of other Antarctic species, including the Patagonian toothfish, while non-Antarctic species such as southern bluefin tuna are migrating southwards. In the Arctic, too, cold-adapted fish stocks are being squeezed northward while southern species such as haddock, cod and salmon are migrating into Arctic waters.
The disappearance of polar sea ice will also affect the communities of organisms living in and under the ice. On the one hand, the importance of these communities is demonstrated by recent discoveries in the Antarctic that icebergs, which have been increasing in number over the past decade due to the break up of ice shelves caused by atmospheric warming, are veritable ‘hot spots’ for ocean life, supporting thriving colonies of sea birds, phytoplankton, krill and fish.22 Significant reductions in sea ice extent, such as that already evid- enced in the Arctic,23 can therefore be expected to have detrimental effects on polar pelagic ecosystems. On the other hand, the disappearance of sea ice can be expected to lead to shifts and possible increases in both the diversity and abundance of benthic communities.""""","","Complex change","Decrease","Increase","","","Increase","","No direction mentioned","","","No direction mentioned","No direction mentioned","","Complex change","","land use change, meaning more infrastructure, shipping routes, etc. due to increased accessibility from climate change","Pelagic marine, Coastal marine, Midwater marine, Deep sea, generally arctic ecosystems, especially those with sea ice coverage","krill; haddock; cod; salmon; polar bears; Adelie penguins; seabirds; Patagonia toothfish; walrus; seals","No direction mentioned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Increase","","","","","","","","Climate change impacts Arctic ecosystems through species range shifts, changing sea ice extents, etc., and this triggers need for multilateral governance across nations (USA and CAN are arctic coastal nations).

The associated vicariance promoted neutral genetic divergence as a direct evolutionary consequence of random genetic drift within refugial populations and low gene flow among them (Fig. 2, Hewitt 2000, 2004). At the end of the last glaciation, some of these genetically differentiated refugial populations (glacial lineages) expanded to colonize previously inhospitable habitats. Phylogeographic inferences regarding glacial refugia and postglacial migration pathways rely on the extant spatial distribution of genetic polymorphisms in the context of geographic barriers for dispersal (e.g., water bodies, mountain chains, deserts, glaciers) (Fig. 2). In plants, these inferences are often strengthened with pollen and macrofossil evidence (e.g., Magri et al. 2006, de Lafontaine et al. 2014a).  Author Manuscript In addition to unraveling the historical biogeography of a wide range of taxa, phylogeographic surveys published over the past 15 years have better characterized the erosion of genetic diversity along migration routes. Postglacial range expansions occur primarily through dispersal of the populations located near the expanding edge of the refugial distribution. The newly established populations are initially small and susceptible to random genetic drift. As a result of founder effects at the expanding edge during the course of migration, a reduction of molecular genetic diversity is expected within the newly colonized area as it harbors only a subset of the original gene pool of refugial populations (Ibrahim et al. 1996, Slatkin and Excoffier 2012). Although a poleward erosion of genetic diversity should be expected when considering a given genetic lineage along its migration route, regions of high intrapopulation genetic diversity but low interpopulation differentiation have often been reported at mid-latitudes (Petit et al. 2003, Hampe and Petit 2005).","Increase","Increase","Increase","","","","","Increase","Complex change","","","","USA -> CAN, CAN -> USA","","Prolonged isolation in distinct glacial refugia may have resulted in disproportionately high levels of genetic differentiation among refugial populations, leading to high levels of regional genetic diversity despite low levels of intrapopulation diversity and a lack of isolation-by-distance (Hampe and Petit 2005, de Lafontaine et al. 2013). Thus, populations in glacial refugia are also expected to contain a relatively high abundance of endemic and ancestral variants, which may be lost during colonization through random genetic drift and repeated founder effects (Petit et al. 2003). As a result, genetic and geographic distances are often correlated positively along migration pathways, reflecting the long-lasting genetic gradient generated by serial founder events or surfing (i.e., genetic drift occurring at the wave front of an expanding population, Excoffier and Ray 2008) during postglacial range colonization (de Lafontaine et al. 2013).

United States, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized that tribal reservations come with water rights to rivers and other surface waters (Brienza, 1992; Wolfley, 2015). The Court later clarified that these rights take as their priority date—important when fitting tribal water rights into prior appropriation—the date that the reservation was established. In addition, some tribes along the Pacific coast can establish water rights to support tribal fishery rights that date to “time immemorial” (Chaffin, Craig, & Gosnell, 2014; Craig et al., 2017). While many tribal water rights still need to be quantified, they nevertheless are very large and very old water rights that can profoundly influence surface water management, particularly in the West (Chaffin et al., 2014).

One relatively new concern in groundwater law is tribal groundwater rights (Shosteck, 2003). In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld Winters rights in aquifers, sparking new attention to tribal interests in groundwater even before the case was decided (Quesenberry, Seward, & Bailey, 2015). Nevertheless, given the recentness of this decision, full exposition of how climate change and tribal groundwater rights will interact with each other and with other water rights remains undeveloped, although Bass (2018, p. 229) noted that “[a]s water becomes scarcer, as competing uses strain California's finite water supplies, and as California transitions to a new groundwater management scheme, judicial recognition of tribes' rights to control their groundwater resources may become an increasingly important—and urgent—tribal objective.

Finally, Native American tribes are becoming increasingly important water rights holders and water managers across the United States. Particularly in the West, water rights settlements and court decrees are progressively quantifying tribal water rights, which are often very senior water rights. Across the nation, tribes are increasingly accepting Congress's invitation through the Clean Water Act to manage water quality on their reservations. The some-times fairly dramatic and legally controversial activation of this third water sovereign can visibly change water management power dynamics and politics, as has occurred in the Klamath River Basin (Chaffin et al., 2014). Nevertheless, tribes' roles at the nexus of climate change and water law have received embarrassingly little attention, even in places like Florida where tribes have had independent management authority for decades.
","Climate change (generic)","","Climate change's effects on water resources generally first become visible in surface waters. Not surprisingly, then, much legal scholarship discussing the relationship between climate change and water law in the United States focuses on how water law can cope with changes to surface waters—lakes, rivers, and streams. Because most of this research has concentrated on western water issues, moreover, this part begins with prior appropriation and its relationship to cli-mate change.


The first complication in discussing the relationship between climate change and water law is the fact that the United States is a large and climatologically diverse nation. As a result, climate change affects water resources differently in different regions, resulting in different implications for state water law. In some regions of the United States, such as the Southwest, the predominant climate change water problem is the progressive reduction of fresh water as the region grows hotter and drier, punctuated by increasingly severe droughts, although some parts will grow more variable (United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), 2019). In other regions, such as in the previously reliably humid Mississippi and Missouri River watersheds and the Southeast, climate-change driven water law problems will likely arise from increased variability in precipitation, where a year or two of record flooding flips to unprecedented drought (USGCRP, 2019). Finally, climate change alterations to both the form of precipitation (generally less snow and more rain) and timing of spring rains and runoff (generally earlier in the year) will challenge water law in still other regions of the United States, such as the Pacific Northwest (USGCRP, 2019).



Nevertheless, legal scholarship addressing tribal adaptation to climate change is still developing, and legal researchers are only just beginning to think about the relationship between climate change and tribal water rights. As one of the first scholars to address this topic, Zanoni (2010) argued that the “practicable irrigable acreage,” or PIA, standard used to quantify tribal reserved water rights is increasingly inequitable in light of climate change and should be replaced by a multi-factor homeland standard that can supply tribes with adequate water for a homeland even under changing climate conditions. Most recently, Hedden-Nicely and Caldwell (2020) argued that climate change requires that tribes be able to re-quantify their water rights as conditions change, requiring the courts to change their current policy of forbidding such re-examination.

Arctic residents possess a multiplicity of experiential and place-based knowledge types that are not grounded in Western scientific paradigms, including Indigenous Knowledge (IK), locally-held or community-based knowledge (LK), land-based knowledge, and practitioner knowledge (Cunsolo Willox et al. 2012; Tengö et al. 2014; Crate et al. 2019). We refer broadly to these as non-Western knowledge types. IK, for example, is grounded in long histories of a people’s interaction with their surroundings, and flexibility to drivers such as climate change is present in relationships with the land (Wenzel 2009; Ford et al. 2015; Abram et al. 2019). Participatory approaches to modelling complex, climate-sensitive processes are, thus, highly applicable to an Arctic context. Increased calls for engagement of IK and LK in climate research cites both the value of non-Western knowledge types for broadening and enriching perspectives on complex climate-related problems, and the importance of ethically engaging Indigenous Peoples and community groups as rightsholders in decision-making (Nakashima et al. 2012; Maynard 2014; Meredith et al. 2019).


Most studies reported engaging with Indigenous and non-Indigenous Peoples in their
participatory processes, which involves engaging with both Western and non-Western
knowledge. This is likely to be due to the presence of multiple autonomous Indigenous
Peoples and community groups in the Arctic, who are increasingly carrying out or commissioning their own research and research agendas, alongside expectations of Western researchers to adhere to protocols such as the duty to consult (Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests) 2004), research agendas developed by Indigenous organisations (Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami 2018), and research funding that is specifically allocated to communities (Peace and Myers 2012).

This review has identified a diversity of approaches being used in the Arctic to engage
participants in modelling climate-sensitive processes. These studies comprise a range of
both degree of participation and ways of engaging with non-Western knowledge types. It
is noteworthy that more participation is not necessarily better participation, nor necessarily
favoured by participants. It is challenging to comment on what is best or most effective
in terms of stage and degree of participation, as this depends on the objectives of the
process and there will likely be different participants or stakeholders with different ideas
of what a successful outcome would be. However, we have identified examples of research
in the Arctic that are successfully implementing highly participatory modelling processes,
while working with and for non-Western knowledge holders in the region.
","Climate change (generic)","","The interaction of climate-related hazards with multiple socioeconomic inequities poses
a profound challenge to society at multiple scales (Gaillard 2010; Tschakert 2012; Watts et al. 2019). The experience of climate change will differ among groups in diverse and unequal
ways, the root causes of which are embedded in development issues (Hewitt 1983; Kelman
et al. 2016). Attempts at understanding and adapting to climate change in the context of
these multiple hazard drivers will need to be sensitive to complexity and context, integrate
diverse local perspectives, and involve deliberate and transformative change to existing
power structures underlying these inequities (O’Brien 2012; Tschakert et al. 2013; van Bruggen et al. 2019; Ford et al. 2020).
It is increasingly understood that the knowledge required for this must include diverse
perspectives and modes of production (Dilling and Lemos 2011). In climate research, positivist forms of knowledge have previously been prioritised at the expense of experiential
knowledge, which can result in the creation of knowledge both detached from its local context and embedded in Western scientific epistemologies that are shaped by histories of colonisation (Conway et al. 2019). Engaging citizens and rightsholders in research and
decision-making is one way to challenge these in-grained hierarchies of knowledge and
their problematic manifestations in the creation of knowledge relevant to climate change
(Sawatzky et al. 2018; Kipp et al. 2019; van Bavel et al. 2020). Participatory processes, including collaborative, co-productive, and cross-cultural methods for knowledge production, can provide more place-based and contextual nuance to previously positivist climate and environmental modelling processes (Lynam et al. 2007; Nakashima et al. 2012; Alshaikh 2013; Crate et al. 2019; Gotts et al. 2019; Mach et al. 2020).","","","","","","","","","","Complex change","","","FIRST PEOPLES <-> CAN, TRIBAL <-> USA","","The Arctic is undergoing rapid environmental changes, including significant reductions
in sea ice extent and thickness, permafrost thawing, changes to species distributions, and
air temperature increases three times the global average over the past 30 years (Nickels et al. 2005; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018; Meredith et al. 2019). This is taking place in the context of ongoing social, economic, and political processes including colonisation, marginalisation, histories of forced relocations, sedentarisation, residential schooling, and cultural assimilation (Furgal and Seguin 2006; AMAP 2017, 2018). The Arctic is, thus, understandably the site of a significant amount of climate modelling research (Hua et al. 2012; Ford et al. 2014).

Increased calls for engagement of IK and LK in climate research cites both the value of
non-Western knowledge types for broadening and enriching perspectives on complex
climate-related problems, and the importance of ethically engaging Indigenous Peoples
and community groups as rightsholders in decision-making (Nakashima et al. 2012;

To effectively overcome these challenges, it's important to appreciate the complexity of local contexts, bring in a range of perspectives, and rethink existing power structures.

In the Arctic, a variety of stakeholders, including Indigenous communities, are key to understanding the processes affected by climate change. Indigenous Knowledge (IK) and community-based knowledge provide valuable viewpoints that go hand-in-hand with traditional scientific methods. Engaging Indigenous Peoples in decision-making is essential for well-rounded solutions.

Participatory modeling methods can improve our understanding of climate issues by integrating these diverse forms of knowledge. This approach can lead to more tailored and thoughtful climate solutions.

With reference to water resource management, particular attention must be paid to the principles of the “UN Convention on the Law of the non-navigational uses of the international watercourses”, adopted by the UN General Assembly (United Nations, 1997).

The development of international water law instruments, as well as UN resolutions which deem access to water and sanitation a human right, the necessity to apply ethical principles to water fields has been evolving in recent decades, – particularly among scholars, NGOs, and policymakers – in order to foster the achievement of basic values such as justice, fairness, common good, and environment respect.


Table 1 Evolution of key-concepts in the water field. 
• Sustainability (Brundtland, 1987) Development based on the rights of future generations and environmental protection 
•	Hydrosolidarity (Falkenmark, 1999) Equitable water allocation among territories, water users and other stakeholders 
•	Integrated Water Resources Management (GWP, 2000) Operational tool in WR management aimed at considering a coordinated management of water, land and related resources 
•	From Potential Conflict to Cooperation Potential (UNESCO, 2003) Political tools for transboundary river basin cooperation aimed at preventing or mitigating water conflicts 
•	Common responsibility of humankind (Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, 2003) Ethical behaviors to guarantee water as basis of life, “integral” to human development and common good and to ecosystem protection 
•	Ecohydrosolidarity (Falkenmark, 2009) Balancing economic efficiency, social equity and survival of the environment

According to the later writings of Falkenmark (2009), the concept of “hydrosolidarity” should be extended to “ecohydrosolidarity”, in order to explicate the necessity of balancing human requirements (including economic efficiency and social equity) and ecosystem needs. Such broader perspective has direct impacts on agricultural sector, because it can help to protect the rural landscapes, to defend biodiversity and to review some agricultural practices in order to reduce impacts on the environment.

Despite the good intentions behind these principles, all the key concepts have their criticisms. Among others, the most controversial points are the following:- Key-concepts express western-world approaches which basically are not oriented toward resolving water problems in other con-texts, particularly in developing countries.- Derive from a top-down approach, which does not adequately consider the participation of stakeholders in the decision-making process.- Can be considered “nirvana principles”, i.e. idealized normative aims of difficult applicability. 

In particular, two ethics must be thought of as driving forces behind specific principles for water: environmental ethic, based on a biocentrism view, – defending the intrinsic value of nature –, and social ethic, which attempts to revise the traditional anthropocentric view, – based on the concept of humankind dominating all creation to his/her exclusive advantage –, including respect for nature, though recognizing the prominence of humankind and the rights of future generations (Rossi, 2009).

Conditions necessary for ethical principles to be applied: First of all, it is of the utmost importance to recognize ethical responsibility for water. Second, ethical responsibility principles have to be founded on a comprehensive approach.
Third, an international governance is required at the trans-national level for the implementation of the goals of hydrosolidarity and sustainable development, according to the proposal of the “Caritas in Veritate” (Pope Benedictus XVI, 2009) of an international authority which aims at guaranteeing human rights in the development of all peoples, while supporting the survival of environment. Fourth, a fair behavior is required particularly concerning governance, management, and uses of water. It is also essential to take into account the necessity of saving energy and

In particular, the applicability of ethical principles requires broadening the responsibility of water governance institutions beyond the water sector to include the conditions necessary for achieving global water and food security, through a control of agro-food business system which is managing a great part of the virtual water “flows”
","Climate change (generic)","","The problems of water management, including water scarcity, ecosystem degradation, and water related disasters are expected to be exacerbated by global trends such as climate changes, population growth urban sprawl, and food uncertainty. In particular, population growth and climate change may have a considerable impact on agricultural water management goal of ensuring enough food for world’s population.

While these principles are well-intentioned, they do face some criticism. One major concern is that they often come from a top-down approach that doesn't fully involve local stakeholders in the decision-making process. It's essential to consider two key ethical perspectives when thinking about water management: the environmental ethic, which values nature for its own sake, and the social ethic, this perspective promotes respect for nature while acknowledging the importance of humanity and the rights of future generations. 
Additionally, it’s important for water governance organizations to broaden their responsibilities beyond just water management and focus on achieving global water and food security, which includes the agro-food business system that plays a significant role in managing water """"flows.""""

Their conclusion:
The ability of species to persist in the long term is highly dependent on their geographical range and dispersal ability [20, 24, 119], and traits such as restricted range and ecological specialisation can act synergistically with climate change to increase extinction risk [117]. 

An example:
 The Micronesia forest skink Emoia boettgeri is endemic to Marshall Islands and has the most limited range of the 11 species of lizards (six geckos, five skinks) found on reef islands of Micronesia [84, 85]. Climate change impacts such as sea level rise, increased storm frequency and intensity, and saltwater intrusion destroy the lizard's critical forest habitat [9]. The restricted area of the coral atolls provides limited opportunities for this species to accommodate any changes in climate (Fig. 3b). The main option available to species on coral atolls is to shift to neighbouring atolls which might have some favourable habitat, but such range shifts are difficult given the vast expense of ocean between islands. Additionally, species from the Emoia genus have an extremely limited capacity for active overwater dispersal, relying mainly on chance events such as rafting on floating debris.

Because space-restricted reef islands preclude range shifts in species whose physiological tolerances have been exceeded, there is significant danger of loss of endemic biodiversity and the consequent loss of evolutionary potential.

Climate change is also expected to influence disease transmission via several mechanisms: • Reducing egg development time in recently-fed adult female mosquitoes, thus reducing the time between blood meals and increasing feeding frequency (42,43,46) • Shortening the extrinsic incubation period, thereby allowing mosquitoes to become infectious faster (42,43,45–48) • Increasing mosquito longevity, enabling infectious mosquitoes to bite more people (44). As temperatures in Canada become milder and humidity and precipitation increase, larger parts of Canada will become climatically suitable for the establishment of some exotic mosquitoes that are currently limited to the tropics and subtropics (3,49,50). Furthermore, as the winters become shorter and summers become longer, the duration of climatic suitability for disease transmission will increase, allowing autochthonous transmission of exotic MBDs for a limited period in some regions of Canada (49). For exotic MBDs that are zoonoses and require an animal reservoir that is currently present in Canada (e.g. Japanese encephalitis), climate change could have further impact on the reservoir such as maintaining and supporting the expansion of natural habitats and prolonging the availability of food sources, thus increasing population size (51,52).

Another layer of complexity to consider when studying insect-transmitted pathogens is the arrival of new plant pathogens due to invasive leafhopper invasions.

Generally, warmer and wetter conditions have been regarded as beneficial to fungal development and reproduction while increasing the probability of northward migration of pathogens from southern latitudes (Broders et al., 2015). Temperatures in the northeastern U.S. have risen at a rate of 0.25 °C per decade since 1970 and are projected to warm by 2.9–5.3 °C through 2070–2099 (Dukes et al., 2009, Hayhoe et al., 2007). Additionally, the northeastern U.S. is projected to experience an increase in annual precipitation on the order of 7–14% through the end of the century (Hayhoe et al., 2007). Wyka et al. (2017a) reported an increasing trend in the northeastern growing season (April–September) mean temperature and cumulative precipitation from 1950 to 2014, with six years from 2003 to 2014 ranked in the top 10% for annual precipitation on record and four years ranked in the top 10% for mean annual temperature. Modeling of seasonal climatic indices found the cumulative precipitation from May–July was the strongest single predictor variable for WPND outbreak severity of the following year, coinciding with fruiting body development and spore dispersal (Wyka et al., 2017a).

The Iroquoians of the Saint Lawrence Valley considered it a “Tree of Peace” (Quenneville, 2007). Eastern white pine was a key component of daily living such that the resin, bark, wood, and needles were used for construction, food, and medicine (Krochmal et al., 1969). This tree is also an integral part of Native Americans’ traditional stories and myths, and art forms (Asselin, 2015). At the time of European Settlement, eastern white pine trees captured the imagination of many European explorers, naturalists, and writers. Currently, eastern white pine is the state tree of Maine and Michigan, U.S., the provincial tree of Ontario, Canada, and it continues to be an important cultural icon for eastern North American forests (Ontario-MNRF., 2014, USDA-USNA., 2016).","Western societies utilize white pines for logging, it is unclear to what extent Indigenous peoples still have access to their 'cultural keystone species' but it is implied that access is reduced","Warmer temperatures, and in some cases increased precipitation, seems to be driving an increase in fungal pathogen infection in North America. Because the range of white pines cross borders (as do some of the disease vectors), increase parasite densities in one region can impact the whole system.","Yes","Management strategies for decreasing threats to eastern white pine health will improve as more is learned about the system, but presently there are some simple silvicultural recommendations that may increase the resilience of eastern white pine. For example, emphasizing site selection and reducing competition may reduce the tree’s vulnerability to stress agents. Sites should be selected that avoid factors that restrict rooting depth within 30 cm of the surface, such as plow pans and bedrock, to avoid drought-induced mortality (Livingston and Kenefic, 2018 this issue). Sites with excessively drained soils should also be avoided (Munck et al., 2016), as well as sites with better soils favoring hardwood competition (Lancaster and Leak, 1978) or Ribes spp. (Ostry et al., 2010). Because regenerating eastern white pine under a canopy helps reduce the risk of white pine weevil and white pine blister rust, the recommended silvicultural approach of sheltherwood cuts for regenerating eastern white pine (Lancaster and Leak, 1978) on properly selected sites will likely help reduce the risk of future health issues.
Stand densities may also be frequently regulated. At early stages, it is best to maintain dense stands to minimize white pine weevil damage, but then to thin stands as soon as trees reach 6 m in height, according to recommended stocking levels (Katovich and Mielke, 1993, Leak and Lamson, 1999, Seymour, 2007). Intermediate thinning treatments may include removal of poor-vigor trees from lower crown classes (Livingston and Kenefic, 2018 this issue). Thinned stands will increase sunlight and temperature in the canopy, which may decrease moisture and reduce optimal fungal growing conditions for C. pinea and WPND fungi. Another useful management strategy is to harvest in the winter if stands have Caliciopsis canker or WPND to avoid spreading inoculum.","No","itcisakik Algonquin community of Canada, Menominee community of northern Wisconsin,  Iroquoians of the Saint Lawrence Valley, Native Americans (broadly)","Eastern white pine is considered a “cultural keystone species” that greatly shaped the identity of Native American Tribes and European settlers (Uprety et al., 2013).

Statistics indicate that six out of ten infectious diseases arise from animal to human transmission with global prevalence [25]. Such transmissions may occur in urban or rural areas [29].
Zoonotic diseases, such as those spread by mosquitoes and other related vectors, have increased in recent years. The rise in global temperatures has created favorable conditions for breeding specific vectors, especially in poorly developed countries [30]. Additionally, the increased precipitation and parallel flooding conditions in certain areas provide the perfect breeding grounds for vectors. Flooding conditions amplify the possibility of waterborne disease transmission [31].
In Russia, climate change significantly affects the spread of diseases. The increased incidence of zoonotic disease is attributed to fluctuating temperatures, causing prolonged periods of vegetation growth and broadening habitat availability, thereby allowing zoonotic pathogens and related vectors to have more suitable living conditions that promote survival and reproduction. Furthermore, increased temperature is causing the melting of permafrost in the area, leading to the concern that the permafrost degradation will expose ancient human burial sites and result in the revival of vectors that spread deadly infections [32].
Climate change can also influence the geographical distribution of insect spread diseases [33]. Zoonotic viruses previously localized to areas with high temperatures, such as the tropics, have been observed worldwide, having spread to subtropical climates and areas with high altitudes. Climate change has caused temperature changes in various geographical regions, meaning that areas previously free from certain diseases now see rises in infection prevalence. Furthermore, climate change is causing people’s general health to deteriorate, making it easier for zoonotic infection to spread [33], as seen with the Zika and dengue viruses, which are now global threats [34,35]. Additionally, in less developed areas, the increase in droughts and flooding has cut freshwater availability, which causes humans to ingest water contaminated with zoonotic waterborne diseases, such as schistosomiasis [36,37,38].
Aside from this, the changes in climatic conditions have forced pathogens and vectors to develop adaptation mechanisms. Such development has resulted in the diseases becoming resistant to conventional treatments due to their augmented resilience and survival techniques, thus further favoring the spread of infection [32]. In some contexts, changes in climate conditions may help to increase the resistance of microbes, such as bacteria and viruses, making treatment more difficult and contributing to an increase in the disease spread.        Climate change causes variations in temperature, rainfall patterns, and climate disaster incidence, influencing the global population’s transmission of diseases and affecting the transmission rates of various vector-borne diseases [30,31].
Global warming favors the increase of vector-borne diseases, especially in poorly developed countries [30].
The rainfall and flooding increase, in many world regions’ favor, the possibility of waterborne diseases transmission [30].
Climatic changes forced pathogens and vectors to develop adaptation mechanisms facilitating the spread of infections [32].

Breeding ranges in Siberia have been described as source locations of HPAI H5N8 viruses migrating westward in 2014 to Europe, causing sizeable outbreaks in poultry and wild birds that have continued to present [6]. Southeast Asian-origin viruses isolated in north-central United States have been shown to move first through Siberia followed by the Alaskan peninsula as an entry point prior to further southward dispersal in North America [6,102]. Northern Pintails and other long-distance migrants have been implicated in the inter-continental migration of IAVs from Eurasia, transmitting to mallards with whom they share breeding habitat in Alaska, prior to ducks driving transmission to other species throughout North America [63,103]. Interactions between disparate populations of wild birds in Arctic breeding grounds, therefore, drive the dispersal of IAVs along flyways throughout the annual cycle.

This could include planting and/or regenerating with mixes of both deciduous and coniferous tree species: the phenotypic plasticity of conifers means that they are generally better adapted to drought than broadleaved species (Rohde and Junttila, 2008) while deciduous trees (Brisson and Lev-rault, 2010) are thought to generally return more water to the environment than do conifers (Hasselquist et al.,2010). Systematic surveys of overall tree health should be con-ducted regularly by experienced people. Monitoring activities should be coordinated across all levels of jurisdictional boundaries and results communicated to experts, policy makers, and the public in language they each understand.  Forest health programs already in place must be maintained and funded. Policies and legislation pertinent to all aspects of tree health should be reviewed to ensure that problems can be quickly responded to (Sturrock et al., 2011). Risk assessments and related rating systems are also valuable planning tools and coordination and sharing of these systems would likely be very beneficial to managing disease problems as they emerge. The establishment and maintenance of a diversity of tree species in forests and urban plantings can help them  maintain  resilience  to  mortality  and  the  other adverse effects that may be brought on by diseases and climate change. Other effective mitigation strategies include tree breeding programs that promote genetic diversity, disease resistance and tolerance to environ-mental stresses (Sturrock et al., 2011). Also proposed is the practice of assisted migration (AM), where hu-mans deliberately move tree species and seed sources (populations). Assisted migration is envisioned to be practiced at three increasingly aggressive and ‘riskier’ scales: the first, assisted population migration, involves the  translocation  of  genotypes  within  their  existing range, the second, assisted range expansion, is trans-location just beyond species’ range limits, and the third, assisted long-distance migration, involves translocation over long distances (Winder et al., 2011). Forest man-agers should use AM “within a framework that allows for flexibility, uses best available science and predictive tools, considers risk and uncertainty, and evaluates and monitors results to ensure that unintended consequences are minimal” (Leech et al., 2011).","No","","","","",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,1,68,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

These 27 fish species would bring with them 83 species of parasites that do not currently exist in the Great Lakes, opening the door for epizootic outbreaks of pathogens in immunologically naïve native fishes (Marcogliese 2001). ;; There is speculation that the recent establishment of 2 species of tropical dragonflies in Florida represents a natural invasion from Cuba and the Bahamas that is related to climate change (Paulson 2001). ;; It is estimated that climate-related range expansion by smallmouth bass in Canada may lead to the loss of over 25,000 populations of minnow species (Cyprinidae) in Ontario (Jackson & Mandrak 2002).;; Establishment of tropical species within the coterminous United States has generally been limited to southern states, but releases of tropical species into open waterways have been recorded throughout North America (Fuller et al. 1999). For example, piranha (Pygocentrus or Serrasalmus) have been recorded in 22 states, and although no populations have become established, areas where overwinter survival is possible may increase with climate warming (Fig. 4). ;; For freshwater fishes changes in the frequency and magnitude of ephemeral conditions may favor species with opportunistic life-history strategies (Olden et al. 2006). In the lower Colorado River, for example, opportunist non-native species, such as the western mosquitofish, guppies, mollies (Poecilia spp.), and red shiners, are likely to increase in distribution and abundance.","","Increase","","","","Increase","Complex change","","","","","","Complex change","","","","","Riparian, Great Lakes, Rivers, Lakes and ponds","","","","","","","","No direction mentioned","","","","No direction mentioned","No direction mentioned","No direction mentioned","","","","No direction mentioned","","","","sport fish; recreation; reservoirs; dams","The likelihood of imminent climate change should make us reflect on current practices that involve intentional stocking of non-native species. For example, butterfly peacock bass (Cichla ocellaris) have been introduced as a sport fish in Florida. The bass are highly piscivorous and there is concern that they could have a negative impact on native fishes (Courtenay 1997). The species was introduced into southern Florida canals based largely on the rationale that cold winter temperatures would prevent it from spreading elsewhere (Shafland 1995). Climate warming may, in fact, eliminate cold winter temperatures as a filter that prevents the butterfly peacock bass from expanding its range in the southern United States.;; Climate change may cause shifts in water development policies that would be detrimental to native biodiversity. Reservoir and canal construction were viewed as a sign of progress during European settlement of North America. In the last few decades, however, the attention has shifted to the negative aspects of reservoirs, and dam removal is now viewed as a sign of ecologically forward thinking. Nevertheless, the pendulum may shift again as policy makers view increased water storage as a necessary option for dealing with water shortages caused by human population growth and exacerbated by climate change (Limerick 2003). Although large reservoirs are rarely constructed in North America now, the area of the United States covered by impoundments continues to increase by about 1% per year, mainly due to construction of small impoundments (Downing et al. 2006). Reservoirs may be promoted as beneficial because they provide water for domestic use and habitat for aquatic organisms. But reservoirs are typically dominated by non-native species, especially fishes stocked for sport fishing (Havel et al. 2005).

In the face of increasing water temperature we would expect a latitudinal retreat in the distribution of coldwater kelp species (e.g., Alaria esculenta) coupled with a poleward expansion by those with warmer water affinities (e.g., Saccharina spp. and Laminaria digitata) across this boundary. Temperature is one of the most important factors controlling the geographic distribution of seaweeds, and their tolerances to high (summer maxima) and low (winter minima) temperatures generally define their biogeographical boundaries (Luning, 1984, van den Hoek and Luning, 1988, van den Hoek et al., 1990, Adey and Steneck, 2001). Moreover, the low dispersal ability of many kelps (Norton, 1992) may limit their ability to “track” large-scale environmental changes.

","Air temperature variability, Precipitation variability, Drought","","Climatic changes over the next century could significantly affect white pine populations both directly and through influences on bark beetles, blister rust, and other pathogens (Campbell and Carroll 2007; Kliejunas et al. 2009). These complex interactions present serious complications for maintaining the distribution and importance of white pines in western North America. An important constraint on mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine is climate, especially the frequency of severely cold winters and brief warm summers (Campbell and Carroll 2007). In warmer winters, more brood could survive; and, with a sufficiently long season, two generations per year could be produced (Bentz and Schen-Langenheim 2007; Gibson et al. 2008). Although mountain pine beetle already produces two generations per year in sugar pine, the consequence of doubling the reproductive potential in a subalpine forest of whitebark pine rather than a montane forest of sugar pine is not readily apparent.

Changes in timing and duration of warmth and moisture could have major influences on the epidemiology of C. ribicola. By some climate scenarios, summers are drier in the Rocky Mountains but wetter in the Southwest (Bartlein et al. 1997; Kliejunas et al. 2009). As infection of white pine by blister rust requires a cool, moisture-saturated environment, conditions suitable for infection in some regions might be restricted to fewer wet periods in spring or early summer but extended in other regions. Early season infection of pine is common for infestations in the coastal regions of British Columbia (Hunt 2005). In the southern Sierra Nevada, infection of white pine normally coincides with spring rains and summer thunderstorms (Kinloch and Dulitz 1990). A sufficiently long and cool winter is required before Ribes break dormancy and become susceptible telial hosts (see Zambino 2010). Climatic change may also have a major effect on other pathogens such as those causing foliage disease (Kliejunas et al. 2009). For example, if increased warmth was accompanied by increased moisture, defoliation by Dothistroma may lead to widespread mortality, as occurs to lodgepole pine in British Columbia (Woods et al. 2005).","Complex change","Complex change","Complex change","","Complex change","Complex change","Complex change","","","","","","USA <-> MEX, CAN <-> USA","","These complex interactions present serious complications for maintaining the distribution and importance of white pines in western North America. The likelihood of sustaining whitebark pine, even in suitable habitats, is further diminished if populations are small (owing to random events, the Allee effect, see Scherm et al. 2006). An important constraint on mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine is climate, especially the frequency of severely cold winters and brief warm summers (Campbell and Carroll 2007).

Increasingly severe wildfire has burned riparian canopy in transboundary river basins such as the upper Rio Grande, leading to short-term (5 year) impacts on aquatic species including macroinvertibrates and salmonid fishes due to increased water temperatures and altered primary production. Studies in other watersheds have found longer term impacts on aquatic species, including lack of recovery 20 years post-fire. ","Yes","Forest treatments, including prescribed burning and thinning, can be used to increase resilience by generating mosaic landscapes with patches of conifers and early seral forest or grassland (Kalies & Yocom Kent, 2016; Whitney et al., 2016). Mosaic landscapes are more resistant to large, stand-replacing fires and reburns because nonconifers interrupt fuel connectivity (Abella et al., 2007; White & Long, 2019). Because treatment is not feasible at large scales, strategic deployment is important, raising questions about priorities.;; Postfire, active revegetation may help to speed revegetation of uncharacteristically large burns where seed sources have been compromised. Such interventions can slow the transition away from coniferous forests as climate changes and wildfires become larger and more severe (Adams, 2013).;;The ability of animals to adapt to climate warming and changing disturbance regimes can be facilitated by removing barriers (Murphy et al., 2020). For example, fencing that blocks wildlife movements on land (Sitters & Di Stefano, 2020) and poorly designed culverts and crossings that block fish movements in streams (Neville et al., 2009, 2016). Forest restoration (e.g., riparian buffers) or treatments can create corridors that help some species to colonize new habitat following displacement. In freshwater ecosystems, similar restoration options exist for promoting resilience. For example, access to diverse aquatic habitats (e.g., tributaries, floodplains, mainstems) can add resilience to freshwater assemblages against future increases in wildfire size, severity, and frequency (Bisson et al., 2003; Dunham, Rieman, et al., 2003; Millar et al., 2007). Recovery plans for species listed under the US Endangered Species Act recognize this by including spatial diversity and connectivity as two of four criteria required to determine whether distinct population units have recovered (McElhany et al., 2000).;;When ecosystem shifts are inevitable, the risk of faunal extirpations can be minimized by interventions that
slow the rate of transition and by managing fire disturbance to promote negative feedbacks.
If transitions are gradual, species may be able to colonize areas that become newly suitable. This can be facilitated by identifying habitat in fire refuges and removing obstacles that help animals to track them (Meddens et al., 2018; Meigs & Krawchuk, 2018). Forested riparian
corridors play a special role by providing refuge from wildfire for terrestrial wildlife (Pettit & Naiman, 2007) and thermal refuge for aquatic biota (Ebersole et al., 2003; Downing et al., 2021). In some cases, conservation of species may require translocation or other active interventions to establish spatial diversity among weakly linked populations (Stein et al., 2013). Reducing other threats can also help species to persist (Keeley & Brennan, 2012).;; larger, undammed watersheds have been shown to support more stable fisheries than smaller watersheds or those with obstacles to movement (Moore et al., 2015).","Yes","Indigenous Native American populations","Although not all studies of terrestrial mammals support the hypothesis (Jones & Tingley, 2021), infrequent fires in boreal forests of Alaska and Canada create habitat heterogeneity that favors higher wildlife diversity. Species that use late-successional forests (>100 years since burn) include caribou that depend on lichens in winter. Because they depend on these wildlife resources (in addition to fish), indigenous Native American populations also depend on pyrodiverse landscapes (Nelson et al., 2008).;; Improving the resilience of animal communities in the face of future climate is not just an academic exercise; some indigenous Americans depend on these populations (Nelson et al., 2008).","","The paper includes additional information about ecosystem transitions due to wildfire and impacts of wildfire on terrestrial species, however these examples are not transboundary so are not coded here.

Similarly, a recent meta-analysis found that increased human disturbance decreased spatial niches for a diversity of mammalian species (Tucker et al. 2018). Although fishers and martens were not included in their analysis, effects are likely to be felt by the taxa, as increased disturbance is likely to minimise the potential for martens and fishers to partition space in the face of rapidly decreasing available habitat and space. Human disturbance has also led to increased nocturnality of carnivorans, thereby decreasing temporal (Gaynor et al. 2018) and dietary (Smith et al. 2018) niche partitioning, though these effects are different for martens than for larger carnivores (Frey et al. 2020).","No","","","","This is very much an implicit flow paper--mentions species movements in canada and us but does not directly address the movements across these boundaries",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,1,88,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

These range from raising awareness of risks and strategies, promoting knowledge transfer, and pressuring corporations to engage in corporate social responsibility or divestment actions, to bringing policy changes, laws and regulations, fostering just energy transitions, energy democracy, and alternative market solutions, and forcing the postponement or cancellation of hydrocarbon activities. These findings complement previous knowledge on the watchdog role grassroots organisations and ENGOs monitor environmental conditions and ensure that polluters do not violate standards (Grant and Vasi, 2016; Madariaga and Allain, 2018; Steger and Drehobl, 2018). More broadly, the findings support and expand previous claims about the importance of ‘governance from below’ and the role of social movements as a recognisable challenge to transnational extractive corporations and ‘business as usual’ in the climate change context (Lemos and Agrawal, 2006; Villamayor-Tomas and García-L´opez, 2018; Scheidel et al., 2020).


Likewise, in several cases in the United States, Argentina, Algeria, and cross-countries studies (Hess, 2019; Hess, 2018; Martinez-Alier et al., 2016; Riffo, 2017), the exhibited regulation and energy democracy were also interconnected. These findings illustrate the interest of applying a ‘cycles’ lens to mobilisation strategies, the co-evolution of social movements and their impact (Oliver and Myers, 2006; Snow and Benford, 1992; Tarrow, 1989; Tilly, 1978; Traugott, 1995).


Last but not least, our findings suggest that indigenous communities, scientists and women’s groups play non-deniable roles within the movements against hydrocarbon activities. A recent report by Oil Change International and Indigenous Environmental Network claimed that more than 700 million metric tons of annual Co2 emissions were prevented by indigenous resistance in the US and Canada (Oil Change International, 2021). This research also indicates the critical role of indigenous people in shaping a future with low carbon emissions. In addition to their role featuring resistance actions, our study illustrates their role as inspirational actors that raise awareness about climate change and justice.
","Climate change (generic)","","The results showed that social movements constrain fossil fuel supplies, support social and political processes needed for climate change mitigation, and potentially avoid emissions through at least ten different contributions. The findings further identified how the specific contributions to staying within the global carbon budget were associated with the different movement strategies and the participation of specific actors, such as indigenous people involved in mobilisations. In this context, scientists, science-policy interface institutions, notably the IPCC, and policymakers, should pay more attention to the contributions of social movements to staying within the global carbon budget. Additionally, the analysis indicates that indigenous participation in movements significantly contributes to limiting fossil fuels; however, the possibility of violent repression is undeniably high. Therefore, the protection of indigenous people’s right to defend their traditional way of life and ancestral lands should be highlighted in climate change mitigation frameworks and pathways to achieve global carbon budget goals.

Firstly, our findings support existing arguments claiming that fossil fuel resistance movements create viable pathways and important political spaces to achieve climate mitigation targets. Moreover, the results yield new evidence that nuances popular assumptions regarding how social movements contribute to decarbonisation.
Secondly, the study provides further evidence for the existing claims that marginalised people, in alliance with other segments of society, contribute to global environmental and climate justice through collective resistance against unsustainable resource use, such as hydrocarbon activities. These alliances are identified in various grassroots movements that include women, indigenous people and minorities, and professional communities to form partnerships across the social spectrum. From a climate justice perspective, participation from vulnerable groups, indigenous people, and movements from the Global South is vital in
shaping more just energy transition pathways and climate change mitigation (Campion, 2021).
","","","","","","","","","","Complex change","","","TRIBAL -> USA","","There is an urgent need for alternative strategies for limiting carbon emissions. The carbon budget concept creates a pathway for linking sustainability science with climate mitigation policymakers and grassroots movements. It enables to quantify the amount of carbon emitted in the atmosphere before the global temperature rises (Lahn, 2020). The target can, in turn, motivate grassroots environmental justice and resistance movements against fossil fuels to promote just and sustainable decarbonisation pathways.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex change","","","Ecosystems (generic)","","No direction mentioned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Increase","","","","Thirteen cases contributed to just transitions. Most used multiple
strategies, mainly protest and civil disobedience, which was reported
most frequently in relation to this outcome (77%). The term ‘justice
and energy transition’ in the literature has several connotations. These
movements aim to achieve justice by confronting hydrocarbon regimes
from different perspectives: intergenerational justice, justice for
indigenous and tribal peoples, and justice for ethnic minorities. Just
transition thus requires the involvement of the local communities, local
workers and indigenous people directly affected by the projects.
Moreover, justice is pursuable when the activist’s values and responses
towards the hydrocarbon regime are supported by the resistance culture
of a particular group of people who were oppressed or negatively
affected by the hydrocarbon economy.

Moreover, studies based on the global Environmental Justice Atlas (EJAtlas) (P´erez-Rinc´on et al., 2019; Scheidel et al., 2020; Temper et al., 2020) have explored how mobilisations
around fossil fuel conflicts can positively contribute to more just and sustainable transitions.","","The levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere continue to rise, prompting climate activists and environmental justice organizations to protest against the extraction and processing of fossil fuels as a means to mitigate climate change. This study examined how social movements contribute to staying within the global carbon budget through their activism against fossil fuel extraction, processing, and transportation. Indigenous groups are crucial in resisting fossil fuel initiatives, though they often face significant risks of repression (mentioning USA as example). Protecting their rights is essential for effective climate mitigation. The study highlights the impactful role of social movements in reducing emissions and urges scientists, policymakers, and institutions like the IPCC to pay greater attention to these efforts.","No","","No","Last but not least, our findings suggest that indigenous communities,

A recent example of these efforts is the Southern Border Fuels Management Initiative, which was initiated in 2017 to conduct fuel treatments across 1,300 kilometers of Department of the Interior (DOI) lands along the US-Mexico border.7 Despite large investments in fuel treatments, our knowledge about the effectiveness of treatments to reduce fuel loads, mitigate wildfire risk, and improve ecosystem health remains limited;;Importantly, preexisting fuel treatments including livestock grazing,27 prescribed fire alone,28 or prescribed fire in combination with mechanical treatments20,29-33 reduced subsequent wildfire severity, associated declines in productivity and mortality of native species, and enhanced post-wildfire recovery.30 Long-term fuel treatment effects on native species were assessed by Havstad and James,34 who found that native vegetation cover was not influenced by prescribed fire 13 years after the burn treatment application, and by Strom and Fulé,29 who projected that fuel treatments had multidecadal effects on native vegetation structure. These contrasting results can be explained by the recovery time of the species and ecosystems studied.;;Pairing post-fire ecosystem monitoring with measurements that took place in the same area before the wildfire occurred offers a promising method to understand recovery patterns and opportunities for management intervention. Most of the fuel treatment studies we reviewed examined changes to wildfire risk over relatively short periods of time, but long-term monitoring is necessary to assess how the risk profile changes through time and when treatments need to be repeated.99 Studies that assess post-fire linkages between vegetation and wildlife are especially helpful to understand ecosystem-level effects, yet are not abundant in the literature.

Neoliberalism is characterised by antagonism towards state interference and regulation. Governmentality shifts the responsibility for the environment onto the population and citizens are called on to take measures to protect the climate. The people are treated as a population that must be managed by using knowledge and by the interests of political economy (Rutherford, 2007).
In terms of governmentality, the national approaches differ also in terms of interaction with stakeholders. The climate agency in these national communications is very state-centred and top-down based, the only exception in this respect being the Canadian approach. The Canadian approach is based on broad participation by various stakeholders: “Provincial, regional, and municipal governments as well as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are working with the Government of Canada to include climate change as part of their long-term planning processes”. The 2007 report (Canada’s Fourth, 2007, p. 98) emphasises the importance of national cooperation.

Several provinces, territories and even municipalities have begun to develop their own action plans, which support action on adaptation. In this the scientific and political discourses treat the local and indigenous peoples the same way. In the political discourses, the Finns and the Canadians separate the indigenous peoples as vulnerable to climate change impacts. As is stated by the Canadian Third National Communication (2001, p. 105) Canada’s indigenous communities are also vulnerable to climate change: “While adapting to environmental change is integral to the daily lives of northern peoples and a capacity to adapt is part of their livelihood systems, extreme events and unusual fluctuations in temperature can hinder their ability to maintain a subsistence lifestyle and can also create safety hazards”.

In comparison the U.S. (2002, p. 82) concern is restricted to nature only: “Natural ecosystems appear to be the most vulnerable to climate change because generally little can be done to help them adapt to the projected rate and amount of change.” However, also the U.S. national communication concludes that adapting to a changing climate is “inevitable.” The U.S. approach (U.S., 2006, p. 67) is not based on making plans and strategies for adaptation, but instead its report lists various “adaptation options” for different sectors in society, including forestry, water resources etc. It is difficult to assess on the basis of
the report how many and to what extent these options have actually been put into
practice. The U.S. focus seems to be on communication of scientific analyses to
the decision-makers and to a public whose awareness of climate change they have
developed.


In the end, the responsibility of adaptation is left to the indigenous and local populations in the region. This is typical of a neoliberal mode of governmentality making the population an object of governmental intervention. Although, the issue of climate change has emerged on the Arctic political agenda, adaptation plans and measures have not been developed as an area for Arctic cooperation. The analysis shows that first of all, there is no common regional concern emerging for adapting to impacts of climate change in the Arctic. Second, Arctic countries vary greatly in their approaches to planning and implementation of adaptation strategies. Therefore, even though climate change as a topic has emerged on the political agenda of the Arctic council, the development of any common regional approach to support adaptation to climate change impacts in the region is not likely in the near future. In the current neoliberal mode of governmentality of Arctic states, climate change is understood mainly as providing new opportunities for exploitation of the resources in the region and the role of the states is to encourage this development to advance national economic interests.
","Climate change (generic)","","In the Arctic, climate change and its impacts have already been observed and
the region has been defined as vulnerable to the impacts of these changes (IPCC,
1997; IPCC, 2001; ACIA, 2004; IPCC, 2007b). However, within the widely spread
neoliberal discourses, the region is constructed in terms of increased opportunities
for exploitation of the regions’ resources due to climate change. The region around
the North Pole is currently divided between Canada, USA, Russia, Norway and
Denmark, but there are many unsettled issues and disagreements about borders and
boundaries (see the map).

In terms of states, their territories and populations and their security, Arctic countries
are concerned about the impacts of climate change, but in very different ways.
The greatest and broadest concern can be found in Canadian communications on
the impacts of climate change. Canadian reports (Canada’s National, 1994, p. 53)
define climate change and call its impacts on Canada “a cause for serious concern”.
In the 2001 Canadian report this concern is further developed: climate change
could have “serious repercussions on Canada’s natural resources, wildlife habitat,
social and economic systems, and infrastructure, as well as on the health and general
well-being of Canadians” (Canada’s Third National, 2001, p. 3). The 2006
Canadian report confirms its concern with recent examples of extreme weather
events: “Canada’s vulnerability to climate variability and change have been clearly
demonstrated by a number of extreme events in the past few years, including
flooding and landslides triggered by extreme rainfall and snowmelt, storm surges drought, heat waves and associated forest fires” (Canada’s Fourth National, 2007,
p. 153). Canada is also the most prepared among the Arctic states to take action to
adapt. Recognising the growing need for domestic action on adaptation, Canada has
taken steps in the national climate change process to develop a policy framework
for adaptation. The 2001 report notes that “Over the last few years, a consensus has
been building in Canada that the climate is changing and that measures will need to
be taken to adapt to these changes” (Canada’s Third National, 2001, p. 96).

In comparison the U.S. (2002, p. 82) concern is restricted to nature only: “Natural ecosystems appear to be the most vulnerable to climate change because generally little can be done to help them adapt to the projected rate and amount of change.” However, also the U.S. national communication concludes that adapting to a changing climate is “inevitable.” The U.S. approach (U.S., 2006, p. 67) is not based on making plans and strategies for adaptation, but instead its report lists various “adaptation options” for different sectors in society, including forestry, water resources etc. It is difficult to assess on the basis of
the report how many and to what extent these options have actually been put into
practice. The U.S. focus seems to be on communication of scientific analyses to
the decision-makers and to a public whose awareness of climate change they have
developed.

Canada takes a more inclusive approach by involving a wide range of stakeholders. This includes not just provincial and municipal governments, but also NGOs—everyone has a role in climate planning.  Different from US; U.S. approach is primarily focused on nature, and appears to concentrate on communicating scientific analyses to decision-makers and raising public awareness about climate change. Different Arctic nations are taking very different paths and often focus on their own economic interests, like resource extraction, rather than working together on adaptation efforts.

vulnerable to changing environmental conditions. The capacity of communities and
households to respond to these changes (i.e., their adaptive capacity) will determine the
impacts of climate and co-occurring stressors.

We characterized three aspects of the stressors facing communities and households: type, timescale, and impact. Overall, we categorized stressors into seven types, as follows: climate (which encompassed physical stressors), biological, economic, environmental degradation, overfishing, political, and social. Importantly, co-occurring stressors can interact in complex ways in SSF and influence the impacts of climate change on communities and households and their response (Freduah et al. 2019).

Building on the existing adaptive capacity literature, we coded for presence or absence of four broad categories of domains anticipated to influence adaptive capacity: Diversity and Flexibility, Access to Assets, Learning and Knowledge, and Governance and Institutions.

The generality of our framework allows broad application to global SSF and other natural
resource-based fields, however, we recognize that the practical application of the ARC
response at local and regional scales also requires specificity. To aid decision-makers in
moving towards adaptation, we reflect on specific determinants that may be influential at the community and household level.

At the community level, investing in access to infrastructure and access to credit/
aid were reoccurring determinants that helped communities Adapt, particularly to
acute perturbations. However, prior experience is often needed to procure these assets
proactively. We believe that combining the risk perception and learning capacity
determinants of Learning and Knowledge in combination with these assets is critical.
Specifically, the sharing of adaptive behaviors from other SSF that have experienced
similar stressors will facilitate the transfer of knowledge about what, when, and how
to invest in proactive infrastructure or funding sources. This information could be
shared though scenario-planning workshops facilitated by NGOs and local government
to set the stage for adaptation planning, which is also a component of the “room for
autonomous change,” determinant of Diversity and Flexibility.

At the household level, focusing on strengthening collaborations between and among
households and individuals through social capital, a determinant of Governance and Institution may strengthen adaptation to stressors. Strong social networks can be supported in a variety of ways, for example, membership in fisher’s groups can provide services including advocacy for fisher’s rights and access to information. These fisher’s groups can also be used to empower women fishers (determinant of Governance and Institutions) through required quotas in membership and leadership that reflect the SSF regional participation of women fishers and facilitate their involvement in strategic decisions in response to stressors. Focusing on these specific determinants can also bring the variety of experiences and perspectives needed to foster Diversity and Flexibility determinants that is increasing capacity of individuals to selforganize, innovate, and diversify livelihoods.

When communities and households can combine domains to best fit the stressor, impact, and local culture, this can facilitate adapting and prevent reacting or coping. If adaptive capacity is generated through a combination of resource availability and willingness to translate resources into adaptive actions then successful examples from adaptive responses in communities and households that have already faced stressors can provide guidance and vision for paths forward.","Climate change (generic)","","Climate change is affecting communities around the world. Impacts that communities experience from climate perturbations are frequently intertwined with non-climatic stressors (e.g., pollution, overfishing). These co-occurring stressors may exacerbate impacts to individuals, households, communities, and nations. Affected populations must respond to these stressors, therefore understanding how and why they respond, and their ability and willingness to adapt to these changes, is critical for climate adaptation planning.

Many social and ecological impacts resulting from climate change on SSF are already apparent. Coral reef fisheries are highly susceptible to ocean warming that causes coral bleaching (Cinner et al. 2015) while fish populations are migrating poleward, potentially displacing fishermen (Morley et al. 2018). As a result of these changes, scholars, resource-managers, and policy-makers are increasingly looking to coastal communities to understand the lived experience of adaptation. In particular, the notion of adaptive capacity.

While biophysical scientists have made significant progress in forecasting the future impacts of climate change using models, projections, and other top-down approaches, there is a need for bottom-up approaches focused on how individuals, households, and communities are responding to recent climate events and conditions (Conway et al. 2019; Frawley et al. 2019b). When communities and households can combine domains to best fit the stressor, impact, and local culture, this can facilitate adapting and prevent reacting or coping. If adaptive capacity is generated through a combination of resource availability and willingness to translate resources into adaptive actions then successful examples from adaptive responses in communities and households that have already faced stressors can provide guidance and vision for paths forward.

The ability of these communities to navigate variable social and ecological conditions is a defining characteristic that has enabled their long-term persistence (Adger 2016; Ford et al. 2011; Oestreich et al. 2019). When communities and households can combine domains to best fit the stressor, impact, and local culture, this can facilitate adapting and prevent reacting or coping.

","","No direction mentioned","","","","","","","","The study highlights the importance of integrating local solutions with shared learning and resource access to foster adaptive capacity and resilience in the face of climate-related stressors.
Small-scale fisheries (SSF), can boost their ability to adapt to the tricky challenges posed by climate change and related issues.  Communities face a variety of stressors that fall into seven main categories: climate, biological, economic, environmental degradation, overfishing, political, and social.  Here are key domains that help communities adapt:
At the community level, having access to infrastructure and financial support is important for adapting, especially when communities learn from each other's experiences. Workshops and planning sessions run by NGOs and governments can help people get ready for whatever comes their way.
At the household level, building social connections through teamwork, supporting fisher groups, and uplifting women in decision-making roles helps strengthen adaptive capacity. Different experiences and viewpoints lead to better self-organization and innovation.
When communities and households combine their resources and are willing to take action together, they can adapt effectively instead of just reacting to challenges.

We identify the key restorative ac- tion of NIDS, which is to slow the drainage of water from the landscape such that more of it can infiltrate and be used to facilitate natural physical, chemical, and biological processes in fluvial environments. Specifically, we assert that the rapid drainage of water from such environments can be reversed through the restoration of natural infrastructure that once existed. We then explore how NIDS can be used to restore the natural biogeochemical feedback loops in these systems. We provide examples of how NIDS have been used to restore such feedback loops, the lessons learned from installation of NIDS in the dryland streams of the southwestern United States, how such efforts might be scaled up, and what the implications are for mitigating climate change effects.

These indicators provide an initial synoptic assessment of the current state, availability, and quality of water in its many forms as well as estimates of changes in the water cycle and management.
Our indicator suite is focused primarily on selected state- and national-scale summaries of annual statistics for data that are collected at much finer spatial and temporal scales. To be most useful for water management, these data need to be able to be stratified by watershed and/ or management units of interest where appropriate. Hence, investment is needed to enable these indicators to be fully scalable and mappable, so that the indicator can be accessed and presented at scales as large as national and scales as small as county/climate division or watershed. Being able to visualize the indicator information at different scales will better enable their use to address issues and answer questions about local-scale changes in the water cycle. Generating gridded datasets from the observations will facilitate this effort.
Beyond the 17 recommended indicators, additional efforts to explore future indicators for soil moisture, snowfall, and evapotranspiration would provide a more complete set of indica- tors for the water cycle. Closing some cross-cutting technical gaps could support enhanced indicators in the future with focused effort by sponsoring agencies.

Moreover, the rapidity of climate change-induced shifts in habitats and trophic food webs could affect contaminant toxicity by altering exposure pathways and increasing susceptibility of some populations, especially those already under stress ;; Spikes in atrazine concentrations may occur after heavy rain events with concentrations reported in North American rivers at up to 108 µg/L and in the Chesapeake Bay at up to 30 µg/L (Fortin et al., 2008). A 96-hour exposure to atrazine at 5 µg/L impaired osmotic control in F. heteroclitus larvae, with higher prevalence of dehydrated larvae at isoosmotic (15 ppt) and extreme (35 ppt) salinities and hyperhydrated larvae at low salinities of 3 ppt (Fortin et al., 2008). In the absence of atrazine, salinity had no effect on the prevalence of hyper or hypo hydrated fish. In estuarine copepods (E. affinis), high (25 ppt) and low (5 ppt) salinity levels increase mortality in response to high doses of the atrazine;; Glaucous gulls (Larus argentatus) had a higher parasitic nematode infection level that was correlated with PCB and organochlorine pesticide concentrations (Sagerup et al., 2000). In laboratory and field studies, northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) exhibited immune suppression because of DDT or dieldrin exposure (Gilbertson et al., 2003). Harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) exhibited a significant correlation between concentrations of PCBs, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), toxaphene, DDT and its metabolites and thymic atrophy and splenic depletion (Breivik et al., 2004). Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) fed POP-contaminated fish collected from the Bering Sea for 2.5 years had higher body burdens of POPs than seals fed relatively uncontaminated fish, and displayed impaired immune responses including suppression of natural killer cell and specific T-cell activity;; OPs, especially PCBs, DDT, dioxins, and furans, have also been investigated as cofactors contributing to recent mass mortality incidences attributed to morbilliviruses among several marine mammal populations (Burek et al., 2008, Kajiwara et al., 2002, Kuiken et al., 2006). For example, a mass mortality incident of 10,000 Caspian seals (Phoco caspica) in the spring and summer 2000 was attributed primarily to canine distemper virus, and like other incidences, was preceded by an unusually mild winter. Kajiwara et al. (2002) found that POP levels, especially for DDT/DDE and PCBs, were higher in animals collected during the Caspian seal epizootic incident than in earlier collections of healthy individuals, suggesting that these contaminants made animals more susceptible to disease;; climate change may also alter patterns of POP bioaccumulation and biomagnification by altering bottom-up or top-down mechanisms controlling trophic food webs (Braune et al., 2005, Macdonald et al., 2003, Schiedek et al., 2007). Climate change-induced alterations in bottom-up controlling mechanisms, such as altered nutrient and primary production, may lead to the addition or removal of trophic levels (Macdonald et al., 2003). This in turn could shift predators higher or lower in the aquatic food web, leading to a respective increase or reduction of POPs. Top-down alterations in trophic structures elicited by the changing climate, for example, could involve the loss or diminished populations of higher trophic level species leading to consumption further down the food chain and reduced POP biomagnification potential.;; In addition to a potentially diminished immune response, other toxic effects linked to chronic, low level POP exposures may impair organism acclimation to ecosystem alterations (Jenssen, 2006).

The broad-scale implementation of forest practices to address climate change impacts has been slow to advance despite an abundance of information, models, tools, and options available to decision-makers (Thompson 2015; Williamson et al. 2019).;;In the Canadian forestry context, some of the key projected climate changes are rapid loss and decline of key tree species (Steenberg et al. 2013; Taylor et al. 2017), changes to the composition and structure of forests altering vital ecosystem services and the benefits people derive from them (Susaeta et al. 2016), changes in the frequency and severity of disturbances (wildfire, drought, severe storms, damaging insect, and disease outbreaks), introduction of new species in areas previously not seen, moisture and forest losses, gains in certain locations, and changes in habitat (see Johnston et al. 2009; Price et al. 2011; Gauthier et al. 2014; Williamson et al. 2019).","","","","Increase","","Increase","Complex change","","","","","","","","","","biodiversity impacts were mentioned in passing, and were not measured by this study.

However, this review found that the majority (54%) of practices in the canadian literature were informed by other studies, particularly from the US.

Various lines of evidence suggest that many NIS may be “poised to prosper” in a rapidly warming world, particularly in aquatic environments 

the re-distribution of Earth’s biota represents one of the most significant and underappreciated consequences of climate change, with numerous implications for human services and ecosystem functioning

The PNW is undergoing rapid climatic change and these trends are projected to continue as temperatures rise over the next century (Stewart et al. 2005; Pederson et al. 2011; Jiang et al. 2018). Simultaneously, human populations are growing quickly in the PNW. Concomitantly, increases in human activity such as international trade and travel, and human-altered environments, which are associated with increased rates of NIS introductions and establishment, are also increasing (Pyšek et al. 2010; Cardador and Blackburn 2019). Not surprisingly, this region is experiencing a proliferation of NIS, particularly in aquatic systems (Fig. 1), with some evidence that expansions are linked to climate-induced changes in temperature and precipitation (Muhlfeld et al. 2014; Al-Chokhachy et al. 2016; Snow et al. 2017). ","Air temperature directional change, Precipitation directional change, River water temperature; hydrology","PNW and surrounds. Some studies cited are in Montanna","Retrospective studies focused on aquatic NIS in the PNW consistently found that climate change has facilitated the spatial expansion of multiple non-native fish species, including rainbow trout, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and carp. While publication bias may exist, only one study reported that climate change did not facilitate the range expansion of a focal aquatic NIS, the zebra mussel (Wilhelm and Adrian 2007). The primary drivers associated with NIS expansion in aquatic ecosystems included increases in water temperature and changes in hydrology. Climate-induced increases in air temperatures and reductions in precipitation increase water temperature (Caissie 2006) and alter streamflow regimes, which can shift the distribution of many aquatic species, particularly cold water species like salmonids (Kovach et al. 2016). These changes can directly affect the growth and survival of salmonid fishes, shift their distributions upstream as streams become too warm to inhabit (Wenger et al. 2011), and in some cases, shift a competitive advantage for a non-native species, as noted in several studies in our review. Several studies indicate that stream temperature increases are exacerbating biotic interactions by facilitating expansion of NIS into native fish habitats. For example, many populations of native cutthroat trout have been displaced from natal habitats through competitive interactions with introduced brook trout, brown trout (S. trutta), and rainbow trout (Wenger et al. 2011). In the Northern Rockies, recent summer temperature increases and decreases in spring precipitation appear to be allowing introduced invasive rainbow trout distributions to expand upstream, thereby enhancing the spread of invasive hybridization with native westslope cutthroat trout populations (Muhlfeld et al. 2014, 2017). Relative to cutthroat trout, rainbow trout prefer warmer temperatures, lower spring flows, and can tolerate greater environmental disturbance (Muhlfeld et al. 2014). Thus, periods of increased temperatures and reduced flows, such as experienced under drought, have probably allowed non-native rainbow trout to proliferate and hybridize with native cutthroat trout populations.

Retrospective empirical research describing climate change impacts on other focal NIS was sparse, but again, multiple studies suggest that climate change has facilitated the expansion of mammals (Snow et al. 2017), insects (Régnière et al. 2009), and plants (Bhattarai and Cronin 2014) through changes in temperature and precipitation regimes. The expansion of wild pigs was best explained by decreasing winter precipitation and decreasing winter and summer temperatures (Snow et al. 2017). Less snow cover allows greater foraging opportunities in one of the most challenging seasons. Gypsy moths have been limited in Canada by summer temperatures and suitable host plants even though initial expansion was rapid (Régnière et al. 2009) and storm events have facilitated colonization events through disturbance (Bhattarai and Cronin 2014). Such events may enhance long-distance dispersal of propagules as well. However, the terrestrial research also points to important complexity, where climate change has both facilitated and restricted the distribution of NIS (Monahan and Tingley 2012; Tobin et al. 2014). For example, summer temperatures could briefly exceed optimal development temperatures and facilitate gypsy moth larval development. However, this temperature effect tipped to lethality if either exposure duration or temperature increased (Tobin et al. 2014). Interestingly, observed patterns in aquatic and terrestrial environments are consistent with findings from a meta-analysis suggesting that climate change may often benefit aquatic NIS, but effects of climate change on terrestrial species will be more complex and context-specific (Sorte et al. 2013).

Sorry to copy so much. This is a good paper that cites a lot of good work.","","","Complex change","","","","","","","","","","USA -> CAN","","Our synthesis revealed that some NIS responded favorably to changes in temperature and precipitation regimes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. However, there was a trend towards stronger responses of NIS expansion in aquatic ecosystems, suggesting that as climate change proceeds aquatic systems may be particularly vulnerable to invasion by NIS (Sorte et al. 2013). The more nuanced responses of terrestrial NIS suggest that understanding fine-scale climatic patterns may be necessary for understanding outcomes. Further, for NIS whose invasion relies on the existence of other species, such as insects with specific host requirements, the response of those other species to climate factors must also be considered. Nonetheless, climate model simulations forecast that the PNW will continue to trend towards warmer drier summers, reduced precipitation and snowpack, reduced summer flows, increased late summer drought, warmer water temperatures, and increased extreme events (e.g., flooding, wildfire, and drought), with important implications for the spread of NIS in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.","","Complex change","Complex change","","","Complex change","Complex change","","","","","","Complex change","","","","","Riparian, Rivers, Lakes and ponds, Temperate forest","","No change (measured)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This paper mentions NCP in the intro but does not follow up in the discussion and does not really talk about NCP when discussing the empirical results from papers.","","","No change (measured)","","","","","","","","air temp/precip/water temp change > change to some limit of invasive species biology > change in population dynamics > increased range/decreased range/changed range","No","does some hand waving but nothing specific","No","","","","",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,1,132,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

Prevention methods at home include cultivating a tick-free yard space by reducing leaf litter on the ground, removing weeds and bramble that may attract small rodents, creating a mulch barrier between the woods and the yard, and allowing ample sunlight to dry out the yard (reducing moisture for ticks) by regularly mowing and landscaping properly [95]. Host-targeted acaricides also are available to treat rodents and deer through passive topical applications [95].

Collectively, the population in these peer groups is about 1.9 million people, representing 5.5% of the entire Canadian population, and is characterised by a high proportion of Indigenous people (First Nations, Metis, and Inuit) (http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-221-x/2011002/regions/hrt4-eng.htm). In Canada, Inuit living in Nunavut, Nunavik (in northern Quebec), and Nunatsiavut (in Labrador) represent 84–90% of the total population in these regions, and 55% of the population in the Inuvialuit region of the Northwest Territories. Based on 2006 census data, First Nations (primarily Cree, and Dene in northwestern Canada) represent 76–97% of the population in northern Quebec (James Bay), Saskatchewan, and Manitoba (http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/as-sa/97-558/index-eng.cfm). It is important to note that northern residents are a diverse population, and generalisations about cultural and dietary preferences rarely apply from community to community, let alone across all of North America.""""","Basically some dietary profiles of different communities","Socio-cultural, IK","",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,1,139,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

These changes may result in increased exposure to abiotic stresses that directly impact white pine, such as drought, cold/freeze injury and airborne pollutants. Weakened trees are more susceptible to attack from opportunistic fungal pathogens, of which there are many associated with eastern white pine in the northeast.

Climate change forecasts predict a wetter and warmer climate for the region with temperatures expected to increase for all months while precipitation is expected to increase in every season except summer (Hayhoe et al., 2007, Campbell et al., 2011). These increases should theoretically be positive for plant growth as Luo, 2007, Anderson et al., 2006 determined that trees will have a higher metabolic process which leads to higher biomass accumulation as temperatures rise with coinciding adequate precipitation. However, early defoliation of eastern white pine caused my WPND has been shown to significantly reduce needle biomass throughout the growing season which implies a decreases photosynthetic capacity and overall negative affect on tree development. Due to the long-lived nature of trees and the relatively short generation time of pathogens, it appears that these wetter and warmer springs will favor the reproduction and dispersal of the foliar WPND, over the positive effects on tree development, resulting in repeated defoliations and chronically stressed trees. Such stressed trees are subsequently under increased threat of infection by Armillaria species which are expected to have extended growing seasons due to increases in temperature. Furthermore, the predicted decrease in summer precipitation (Campbell et al., 2011) coupled with increases in temperature could result in water deficits leading to drought stress in eastern white pines which predisposes trees to infection by Caliciopsis and Diplodia canker (Blodgett et al., 1997, Desprez-Loustau et al., 2006, Munck et al., 2009, Munck et al., 2015a).

For example, thinning increases climatic resilience of red pine (Magruder et al., 2013). Thinning has also been initially successful at ameliorating foliar symptoms of WPND (McIntire et al., 2018 this issue). Reducing competition will help residual trees to withstand adverse conditions by increasing their access to sunlight and space. Maintaining adequate stocking in white pine stands growing on excessively drained, nutrient poor sites will likely reduce damage from Caliciopsis canker and foliar diseases (Leak and Lamson, 1999, Munck et al., 2016).

environments. Challenges associated with identifying reliable tracers for
MSW landfill leachate are regularly reported. Sediment sampled from
the Laurentian Great Lakes basin contain POPs from legacy release from
industrial point sources and atmospheric deposition but are also
contaminated with current-use POPs and emerging contaminants. The
Laurentian Great Lakes continue to receive large direct inputs of currentuse POPs, namely PBDEs and perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs),
particularly perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic
acid (PFOA). However, the region was, and continues to be, subjected to
intensive industrial pressures (Helm et al., 2011) that can convolute

repeatedly implicated as point sources of POPs transformation products

proportion of contamination represented by the transformation

The timing of life history stages (phenology) of many insect species has already been demonstrably advanced by warming temperatures (Harrington et al. 2001; Logan et al. 2003), and there are growing examples of insect distributions extending northward (Parmesan 2006). Accordingly, there are reports of growing damage from some forest pests at the poleward and (or) alpine limits of their historical occurrences (e.g., Jepsen et al. 2008; Lima et al. 2008). Climate change may also affect pest populations through impacts on other organisms within the community. For instance, it is well known that climate can affect concentrations of secondary metabolites and nutrients in plants, with consequences for herbivores (Ayres 1993; Ayres and Lombardero 2000). Also, climate can affect natural enemies of insect pests (Burnett 1949) and ecologically important symbionts (Lombardero et al. 2003; Six and Bentz 2007). 

About pathogens: Direct effects of climate change on forest pathogens are likely to include (i) increased growth and reproduction; (ii) altered propagule dispersal, transmission rates, and infection phenology; and (iii) changes in overwinter survival. Indirect effects may include changes in (i) host nutrient status, resource allocation, and susceptibility to pathogen attack; (ii) distribution, life cycles, or phenology of insect associates or other vectors; (iii) the distribution of primary and alternate hosts; (iv) mismatches between adult tree location and optimal conditions, resulting in tree stress and increased disease susceptibility; and (v) the creation of novel community assemblages or mismatches between locally or regionally co-adapted genotypes that could enhance the potential for virulence. Climate change is almost certain to be a strong driver of evolutionary change in plant and pathogen populations (Harvell et al. 2002). Short generation time among pathogens relative to tree hosts allows a faster genetic response (Hafner et al. 1994; Brasier 2001). In general, introduced pathogens undergoing sustained population growth while encountering novel hosts should exhibit greater potential for rapid evolutionary response to changing abiotic conditions than native pathogens (Brasier 1995). Additionally, rapid evolution via interspecific hybridization in several fungal pathogens has recently been established, and contact between historically isolated genotypes facilitated by climate-induced range shifts could promote such hybridization (Brasier 2001). 

About invasive plant species: Initially, plant responses to climate change will shift the competitive balance among species within a plant community. Warming will lead to range changes: some expansions, often at colder, northern population boundaries, and some retractions in response to warmer or drier climates.","","Decrease","","","","Increase","Complex change","","","","","","Complex change","","Complex change","","","Boreal forest, Temperate forest","Pinus strobus; Tsuga canadensis; Fagus grandifolia; Adelges tsugae; Malacosoma disstria; Armillaria spp.; Cryptococcus fagisuga; Neonectria spp; Frangula alnus; Celastrus orbiculatus","","Decrease","","","","","","","","","","","","Decrease","","","","","","","forestry industry","It has been suggested that F. alnus may also have economic impacts with detrimental effects on the native white pine (Pinus strobus L.) timber industry in North America.

2.

Historically, management has focused on suppression and prevention. Suppression involves short-term tactics designed to reduce current infestations by manipulating insect populations through the use of fire, pesticides (contact and systemic insecticides, microbials [bacteria, viruses, pathogens and nematodes]), insect growth regulators, soaps, and horticultural oils, semiochemicals (chemicals produced by one organism that elicits a response, usually behavioral, in another organisms, e.g., pheromones), sanitation harvests (harvesting currently infested material and destroying living life stages in that material before they emerge), or combinations of these treatments (Coulson and Witter 1984, Fettig and Hilszczański 2015). For suppression to be effective, accurate detection and survey methods are required to identify and delineate infestations prior to treatment.

latitude climate are now becoming apparent in temperature (e.g.
the medieval warm period and little ice age) and perhaps moisture
delivery patterns (e.g., Overpeck et al., 1997). The pace of change
over the past three decades has been even more impressive, with
summer ice extent in 2012 being 54% less than the 1980 benchmark and thickness diminishing by half (Cavalieri and Parkinson,
2012; Barber et al., 2015 and references therein). Associated with
the rapid retreat and thinning of sea ice the water column has

retreating on an annual basis past the shelf break, and thus exposing basin waters directly to sunlight and wind forcing. Our rough
calculation suggests that the summer 2012 sea ice retreat left

is that upwelling favorable winds can now directly and efficiently
drive shelf-break upwelling, and draw nutrients from subsurface
basin waters onto the shelf (Section 6.3) (Carmack and Chapman,
2003). However, the same upwelling favorable winds will also create onshore pressure gradients over the slope and basin, which will
act to disrupt the flow of waters in the ACBC (see Section 6.3).

More recently, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) adopted Resolution no. 3/2021, entitled ‘Climate Emergency: Scope of the Inter-American Human Rights Obligations’ (IACHR 2022). The resolution characterizes climate-induced migrants as a vulnerable and marginalized group that has contributed the least to the disruption
of the global climate system.""""

reduced uptake of soil nutrients by crops, and is
flushed into streams at much larger rates during
subsequent wet years (Goolsby et al. 1999). Wet

“As environmental conditions change, bacterial infections routinely reported from direct contact with, or ingestion of, fish in more southern regions may also become a greater concern for northern communities who depend on fish for subsistence and as part of their food sovereignty (126). While there are currently no known zoonotic viruses of fish origin, there are many viruses among fish that share evolutionary history with modern human viral pathogens, and viruses have been shown to readily jump between species in the aquatic environment (308).” ([Keatts et al., 2021, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/PVZXHQ2N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S2QN44SA?page=13&annotation=K2CU8N9Q))

“For many Indigenous cultures around the Arctic, wildlife as food, and food sharing, are fundamental components of a cultural value system that emphasizes generosity, reciprocity, and cooperation, and usually operates within networks related to kinship and family social groups within the community (261–267). Alaska prohibits the sale of most wildlife hunted by Alaska Natives to non-Alaska Natives, but, across Canada, different jurisdictions recognize different Indigenous rights and responsibilities with respect to disposition of country food. For example, in Nunavut, an Inuk has the right to dispose freely to any person any wildlife lawfully harvested (268). Food exchanges are important because of the nutritional value of the items exchanged, and also because they carry cultural and economic values (53, 269, 270).” ([Keatts et al., 2021, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/PVZXHQ2N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S2QN44SA?page=11&annotation=9ADWGRSE))

“Local sharing of foods can facilitate community zoonotic disease outbreaks (e.g., trichinella or botulism, as noted in Table 2); however, the limited potential for human-to-human transmission of current pathogens spread via sharing, and the low human population density, makes the likelihood of epidemics and pandemics originating from such activities very low. While this traditional way of sharing remains, there also exist other broader networks of sharing practices established to support urban hubs such as Anchorage, and others, across the United States (265, 266). Although low levels of consumption and sharing of traditional foods by Indigenous Peoples in urban centers in Canada have been previously reported (64, 271), relatively new sharing networks have emerged as a result of social media (272, 273) that facilitate the broader distribution of country food, often at the expense of local and traditional sharing practices and values (274), and potentially facilitating the spread of pathogens across larger geographic regions.” ([Keatts et al., 2021, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/PVZXHQ2N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S2QN44SA?page=11&annotation=Z4NK6PQQ))","Climate change (generic), Sea temperature change","","bacterial infections routinely reported from direct contact with, or ingestion of, fish in more southern regions may also become a greater concern for northern communities who depend on fish for subsistence and as part of their food sovereignty """"","Increase","","Complex change","","","","","","","","","USA <-> CAN <-> first peoples","OTHER - described in above short answer question, specify directionality","","While there are currently no known zoonotic viruses of fish origin, there are many viruses among fish that share evolutionary history with modern human viral pathogens, and viruses have been shown to readily jump between species in the aquatic environment (308).”","","","","","Complex change","","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal marine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Change","","","","","","","","fish for subsistence","“As environmental conditions change, bacterial infections routinely reported from direct contact with, or ingestion of, fish in more southern regions may also become a greater concern for northern communities who depend on fish for subsistence and as part of their food sovereignty (126).

“Risk for emergence of zoonotic-origin pandemic pathogens from wildlife use in Arctic and boreal biomes is currently minimal, indicating that new policies restricting these traditional and subsistence activities in the name of pandemic prevention would be unfounded at the current time.”

“In general, there has been minimal research on the risks associated with traditional and country food preparation practices, despite awareness of zoonotic pathogens found in harvested wildlife and a clear need for risk reduction (118). Good hygiene during butchering and skinning, and thorough cooking of food can prevent transmission of many of the endemic zoonotic pathogens reported (118).” 

“Ensuring ownership of health initiatives by local communities in general, and specifically in the necessary prioritization process, is essential, with ample evidence demonstrating that failure to engage and build trust with local political and thought leaders, Elders, traditional health workers, and community groups in disease detection and control, will delay both diagnosis and response for emerging diseases (330).

“Rich knowledge, including on preventing certain food-borne illness, results from the long-standing relationships of Indigenous Peoples and local communities with their environment, including their harvesting of nutritionally and spiritually important native plants, fish, and wildlife (56, 57, 118, 339, 340). Indigenous knowledge; the prevention, monitoring, and surveillance of zoonotic agents; and education are considered the most important methods to reduce human health risks associated with the consumption of traditional and country foods (118).”

“In general, parasites, lesions (discoloration, tracts, fungal growths, etc.), or abnormal behavior of hunted animals are often observed by Indigenous and local communities. Indigenous Peoples were some of the first to draw attention to traditional and country food safety concerns related to environmental contaminants, because of changes they detected in quality of the animals and fish they hunted (118).” 
“Recent working groups assessing Unusual Mortality Events (UMEs) for marine mammals and other species around Alaska include Indigenous perspectives and observations (191, 342) and, across Canada, several Indigenous-led Guardians Programs monitor ecological health, maintain cultural sites, and protect sensitive areas and species, while also playing a vital role in creating conservation plans, and supporting Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas (343)” ([

“It is important that the desire to increase awareness of the potential risk of zoonotic infections be balanced with the unintended consequences on other determinants of health. Past experience with poorly designed communication strategies and materials with respect to country and traditional foods, such as contaminants in wild-caught foods, provides stark lessons on the need to avoid provoking unnecessary fear when addressing food safety risk in Indigenous and local communities (71, 72). For example, scientific communication to Nunavut Inuit communities in the late 1980s that women’s breast milk had high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), failed to consider broader understanding of contamination issues in the region, and failed to include the Inuit directly on messaging (72).

Th is hypothesis was further validated
with the discovery in July 2009 of a kudzu
population in Essex County, Ontario,
Canada (Fig. 19.5). Th e patch, which
measured 50 m  150 m (164 ft  492 ft),
was found on a bluff overlooking Lake Erie
near Leamington, Ontario – a farming
community about 70 km (45 miles) southeast
of Detroit, Michigan. Th is is much
further north than kudzu was ever expected
to grow in North America.

Th e origin of the infestation – whether it
was planted or simply fl oated across Lake
Erie from Ohio – is unknown. However,
according to Rachel Gagnon, Director of the
Ontario Invasive Plant Council, the
infestation is well established but more or
less contained – and is not known to occur
elsewhere in Canada. Rowan Sage, a biology
professor at the University of Toronto, has
recommended that the infestation be
destroyed immediately or ‘the plant could
wind up costing millions of dollars to
eradicate’ (CBC News, 2009).
Even though kudzu is currently well
contained, the discovery of kudzu in Canada
argues strongly in favour of early detection
and rapid response measures in areas likely
to be impacted by climate change (e.g. rapid
warming above winter thresholds).","Increase","","Increase","","","","","","","","","","USA -> CAN","No, it is all in this paper.","Kudzu often grows over, smothers and

Such external flows would impact the strain on internal systems in the country of origin.","Yes","“Adaptive measures to combat climate change as a major trigger of migration have been developed in various contexts. However, their comprehensive implementation in the Global South is hindered by socioeconomic factors114. For example, in regions where farmers rely on agriculture, the high cost of implementing relevant adaptation strategies is prohibitive due to the low socioeconomic status and income of the population85. Migration becomes a personal adaptation strategy when adapting in place is no longer an option119.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=JGAL2C8E))

“However, due to the expenses and resource requirements of migration, individuals and families with limited means may be unable to relocate, forcing them to face the challenges of climate change involuntarily123. Some individuals will choose to face these challenges due to their cultural ties to the land and community124, while others may seek opportunities in nearby cities as an alternative for livelihood generation90,111. The lack of adaptive strategies, especially among individuals of low socioeconomic status, makes them particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to a lack of assets, knowledge, and networks125. Therefore, as the risks of climate change intensify, there is a growing need to provide support for households that have made the decision to migrate, as well as to implement adaptation strategies for those who are unable or choose not to relocate13.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=I7YNES4Y))

“One intervention that governments can employ to assist communities in coping with climate migration is the relocation of affected people to better and more habitable locations41,44. People living in areas affected by droughts, limited water resources, or frequent floods in low-lying areas should be relocated to areas with sufficient water or minimal flood risk126. However, relocation requires resources and should be adequately planned with input from affected populations to avoid unanticipated challenges125,127. Previous relocations have failed due to loss of livelihood, cultural heritage, and social networks, often resulting in abject poverty for the relocated people123. Governments must strive to provide sources of livelihood for the relocated communities, although many developing countries struggle to implement such actions due to limited resources122.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=JEEHTHEC))

“Various initiatives have been launched to address international migration caused by climate change, such as the Task Force on Displacement, the Global Compact for Migration, the UN Network on Migration, the Kampala Convention, and the Cancun Adaptation Framework. While their direct focus on climate change varies, each has contributed to highlighting climate change as a fundamental driver of migration that must be promptly addressed128. For instance, under the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of the Paris Agreement, mobility has been conceptualized as a strategy for adaptation. Most recently, the Nansen Initiative, which evolved into the Platform for Disaster Displacement, has specifically aimed to address the needs of cross-border migrants displaced by natural disasters129. These initiatives encourage countries to commit to addressing the adverse effects of climate change on migrants and establish measures to acknowledge migration due to climate change, plan relocations, and promote collaboration to mitigate associated challenges120,130.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=XENN769W))

“Researchers have also advocated for social protection measures to manage climate migration, supporting people who choose to stay in their communities to maintain their livelihoods, and addressing the drivers of migration that force people to engage in maladaptive migration132. However, until recently, there has been limited cooperation between countries in the Global South concerning fostering safe migration or safeguarding the rights of climate migrants in receiving areas25.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=3C9WPI4I))

“Therefore, it is essential to identify localities at risk of depopulation to effectively coordinate migration and relocation. Potential relocation areas for displaced individuals must be extensively assessed to ensure they can sustain increased populations without further hardships. Countries must share the responsibility of planning, identifying suitable relocation areas, and providing support to relocated individuals in host societies118. Additionally, collaboration between origin and destination countries is crucial for planning future climate change-induced migration in a way that benefits both nations109.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=LIP4HMR5))

“public-private partnerships, philanthropic donors, and international organizations should establish and provide increased support to people living in areas prone to sea-level rise, flooding, and drought. This support should also extend to those who have limited financial and adaptive resources to avert prolonged displacement and migration19. However, developing countries must still take prompt actions and measures to combat climate change and its effects, and consider climate-induced migration a critical problem that must be addressed immediately within their countries and regions117.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=XZJPNAE3))

“Finally, the development and implementation of measures such as long-term planning, effective strategies for absorption of shocks and rapid recovery, and innovative adaptation solutions can contribute to enhancing the resilience of communities and avoiding the negative impacts of migration42,107. Strengthening planning, absorption, recovery, and adaptation capacities requires concerted efforts across different sectors44,79. These efforts should include upgrading infrastructure systems and increasing their resilience108, improving household economic capacities29,88, enhancing the efficiency of resource consumption and production25,99, engaging local communities in planning and decisionmaking processes118,134, utilizing modeling and scenario-making techniques for planning under different future scenarios, and employing smart solutions such as early warning systems to facilitate better response and absorption capacities136,137.” ([Almulhim et al., 2024, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Q3M7ZLFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCKNTHT9?page=6&annotation=2S3HIBGM))","No","","","","Another potential socioeconomic flow is mentioned at the very end of the solutions section, which is transboundary cooperation and collaboration for migration-preventing climate adaptation (tech transfer and financial support).

Most health impacts will be adverse and will occur via direct exposures (e.g., heat waves, extreme weather events) and less direct influences arising from disruptions to environmental, ecological, and social systems. Indeed, most of the impacts of climate change on physical, ecological, and social systems will affect human health via changes in food yields, freshwater flows and quality, stability of infectious disease patterns, air quality, social cohesion, and family income and livelihoods (Costello et al. 2009; McMichael and Lindgren 2011).

“populations in low income countries whose health is most at risk from climate change (Confalonieri et al. 2007), and where there are often high pre existing levels of health problems, are used to coping with adverse health outcomes without recourse to migration.

“Policy making will need to recognize the complexity and heterogeneity of migration—in terms of motivating factors and diversity in duration and destinations and in the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of migrants (Tacoli 2010).

“Faced with competing priorities and climate change challenges, the NAPA pro cess compels countries to prioritize projects geared to immediate priorities in single sec tors (e.g., alleviation of water resource scar city) (Hardee and Mutunga 2009). Given the complex paths by which climate change will affect human health and migration responses, effective public health and adaptation strate gies must embrace policies across multiple sectors, including health, water, agriculture, energy, and transport. This will require coor dinated efforts of local and national govern ments and relevant international, national, and local institutions, nongovernment orga nizations, and agencies. Adaptive strategies, including public health initiatives, should also be integrated with existing national develop ment, public health, and poverty reduction strategies. Clearly, there is a need for multi level, interdisciplinary, and integrated adapta tion measures and emergency responses—and for funding bodies to recognize the eclectic nature of this need.” ([McMichael et al., 2012, p. 651](zotero://select/library/items/ULVSWDCU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2888YDQ2?page=6&annotation=87WRTLQE))

“Public health and policy responses to address health risks associated with climate related migration must be responsive to the nature of mobility and the demographic characteristics of those who move. Broadly, it is important to a) minimize any health ineq uities and ensure access to services, b) ensure health rights of migrants, c) implement interventions to reduce excess mortality and morbidity among migrant populations, and d) minimize the negative impact of the migra tion process on migrants’ health outcomes (WHO 2010).” ([McMichael et al., 2012, p. 651](zotero://select/library/items/ULVSWDCU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2888YDQ2?page=6&annotation=DTUH22AC))

Wildfires impact watersheds which support the spawning of migratory aquatic species (western north american fishes). Migration flows may change as a result of impacts to watersheds. migration may change in multiple ways, including extirpation of local populations, recolonization from populations at sea, and reduced survival of early salmonid life stages within burned watersheds. ","Yes","Forest treatments, including prescribed burning and thinning, can be used to increase resilience by generating mosaic landscapes with patches of conifers and early seral forest or grassland (Kalies & Yocom Kent, 2016; Whitney et al., 2016). Mosaic landscapes are more resistant to large, stand-replacing fires and reburns because nonconifers interrupt fuel connectivity (Abella et al., 2007; White & Long, 2019). Because treatment is not feasible at large scales, strategic deployment is important, raising questions about priorities.;; Postfire, active revegetation may help to speed revegetation of uncharacteristically large burns where seed sources have been compromised. Such interventions can slow the transition away from coniferous forests as climate changes and wildfires become larger and more severe (Adams, 2013).;;The ability of animals to adapt to climate warming and changing disturbance regimes can be facilitated by removing barriers (Murphy et al., 2020). For example, fencing that blocks wildlife movements on land (Sitters & Di Stefano, 2020) and poorly designed culverts and crossings that block fish movements in streams (Neville et al., 2009, 2016). Forest restoration (e.g., riparian buffers) or treatments can create corridors that help some species to colonize new habitat following displacement. In freshwater ecosystems, similar restoration options exist for promoting resilience. For example, access to diverse aquatic habitats (e.g., tributaries, floodplains, mainstems) can add resilience to freshwater assemblages against future increases in wildfire size, severity, and frequency (Bisson et al., 2003; Dunham, Rieman, et al., 2003; Millar et al., 2007). Recovery plans for species listed under the US Endangered Species Act recognize this by including spatial diversity and connectivity as two of four criteria required to determine whether distinct population units have recovered (McElhany et al., 2000).;;When ecosystem shifts are inevitable, the risk of faunal extirpations can be minimized by interventions that
slow the rate of transition and by managing fire disturbance to promote negative feedbacks.
If transitions are gradual, species may be able to colonize areas that become newly suitable. This can be facilitated by identifying habitat in fire refuges and removing obstacles that help animals to track them (Meddens et al., 2018; Meigs & Krawchuk, 2018). Forested riparian
corridors play a special role by providing refuge from wildfire for terrestrial wildlife (Pettit & Naiman, 2007) and thermal refuge for aquatic biota (Ebersole et al., 2003; Downing et al., 2021). In some cases, conservation of species may require translocation or other active interventions to establish spatial diversity among weakly linked populations (Stein et al., 2013). Reducing other threats can also help species to persist (Keeley & Brennan, 2012).;; larger, undammed watersheds have been shown to support more stable fisheries than smaller watersheds or those with obstacles to movement (Moore et al., 2015).","No","Indigenous Native American populations","Although not all studies of terrestrial mammals support the hypothesis (Jones & Tingley, 2021), infrequent fires in boreal forests of Alaska and Canada create habitat heterogeneity that favors higher wildlife diversity. Species that use late-successional forests (>100 years since burn) include caribou that depend on lichens in winter. Because they depend on these wildlife resources (in addition to fish), indigenous Native American populations also depend on pyrodiverse landscapes (Nelson et al., 2008).;; Improving the resilience of animal communities in the face of future climate is not just an academic exercise; some indigenous Americans depend on these populations (Nelson et al., 2008).","","The paper includes additional information about ecosystem transitions due to wildfire and impacts of wildfire on terrestrial species, however these examples are not transboundary so are not coded here.

“conservation”) could help mitigate alterations in boreal caribou
habitat for the entire RIA study area (Leblond et al. 2022).
Halting harvest activities in areas where habitat suitability is
currently high could help maintain high-quality habitat even
under the most intense climate change scenarios as opposed
to business-as-usual harvest (Fig. 5vi; “BaU”). Reducing harvest
levels was also shown to mitigate climate-induced decreases
in the probability of occurrence for caribou in central Quebec
(St-Laurent et al. 2022). Likewise, Labadie (2022) found that a
management scenario aiming at creating exclusive zones for
conservation, while other zones would experience alternativemanagement
strategies to increase the proportion of oldgrowth
stands, would help decrease caribou predation and
mortality regardless of radiative forcing.
These studies demonstrated that forest harvesting is a key
driving force in a caribou–moose–wolf assemblage. Substantially
reducing harvest rates or protecting specific areas mitigated
the loss of old conifer andmixed forests favored by caribou,
irrespective of climate-induced increases in fire activity.
Conversely, high harvest levels coupled with increased fire
activity would increase young, nutrient-rich stands for other
ungulates (Potvin et al. 2005), exacerbating the vegetationdriven
apparent competition dynamic between moose and
caribou (Seip 1991; Wittmer et al. 2007; Frenette et al. 2020;
Labadie 2022).;The collaborative research work with the Abitibiwinni and
Ouje-Bougoumou First Nations (Fig. 1f) highlighted the benefits
that could be achieved from lowering harvest rates. Major
changes in forest structure and composition are expected
in the coming decades, and developing adaptation and mitigation
strategies could limit the effects of climate change
on Indigenous livelihoods and cultures. Indeed, we showed
that increasing harvest levels could accelerate the climateinduced
loss of good trapping habitats for marten (Figs. 5ix
and 5x, “Intensification”) in the northwestern part of our
study area, whereas opposite effects would be reached under
strict conservation (Figs. 5ix and 5x; “conservation”). The
capacity of Indigenous communities to adapt to changing
environmental conditions has been demonstrated numerous
times in the past. However, there are limits on adaptive capacity,
and the factors that maintain it still need to be investigated
and documented. Strategies could include the valorization
of traditional knowledge associated with the forest
types that will be more prevalent in the future. Strategies
to limit fire hazards at culturally significant locations,
species, and infrastructure should also be considered. Moreover,
diversifying landscape values that guide forest management
to take into account Indigenous values is advised. More
generally, a step toward collaboration with Indigenous peoples
in land management is needed to face the challenges
of environmental change. Collaborations between First Nation
and provincial/territorial departments aiming at adapting
forest management to community values already exist in
Canada (e.g., Conseil Cris-Québec sur la foresterie in Quebec [http:

In addition to the health risk for people who interact with these animals or their environments, there is potential for reduced food security for northern communities, through the direct loss of animals from E. rhusiopathiae (56, 120, 123).”

“The current threat of pandemic zoonotic disease emergence from hunting, consumption, and use of wildlife in the North American Arctic and boreal biomes is low, and policies restricting these traditional and subsistence activities in the name of pandemic prevention would be greatly misplaced. Health threats from endemic zoonotic diseases in northern biomes remain, with plausible hypotheses that environmental alterations from development, and climate change could alter epidemic and pandemic risks.”

“For many Indigenous cultures around the Arctic, wildlife as food, and food sharing, are fundamental components of a cultural value system that emphasizes generosity, reciprocity, and cooperation, and usually operates within networks related to kinship and family social groups within the community (261–267). Alaska prohibits the sale of most wildlife hunted by Alaska Natives to non-Alaska Natives, but, across Canada, different jurisdictions recognize different Indigenous rights and responsibilities with respect to disposition of country food. For example, in Nunavut, an Inuk has the right to dispose freely to any person any wildlife lawfully harvested (268). Food exchanges are important because of the nutritional value of the items exchanged, and also because they carry cultural and economic values (53, 269, 270).” ([Keatts et al., 2021, p. 11]

“Local sharing of foods can facilitate community zoonotic disease outbreaks (e.g., trichinella or botulism, as noted in Table 2); however, the limited potential for human-to-human transmission of current pathogens spread via sharing, and the low human population density, makes the likelihood of epidemics and pandemics originating from such activities very low. While this traditional way of sharing remains, there also exist other broader networks of sharing practices established to support urban hubs such as Anchorage, and others, across the United States (265, 266). Although low levels of consumption and sharing of traditional foods by Indigenous Peoples in urban centers in Canada have been previously reported (64, 271), relatively new sharing networks have emerged as a result of social media (272, 273) that facilitate the broader distribution of country food, often at the expense of local and traditional sharing practices and values (274), and potentially facilitating the spread of pathogens across larger geographic regions.” ([Keatts et al., 2021, p. 11]","Climate change (generic)","","The cumulative impacts of environmental and climatic changes may be increasing the susceptibility to the bacteria Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae in certain wild animal host populations","Complex change","","Complex change","","","","","","Complex change","Complex change","","CAN <-> USA <-> First peoples","OTHER - described in above short answer question, specify directionality","","“The cumulative impacts of environmental and climatic changes may be increasing the susceptibility to the bacteria Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae in certain wild animal host populations, including multiple unusual mortality events of muskoxen in Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, and Alaska, and of moose and caribou in British Columbia (120–122).

“For many Indigenous cultures around the Arctic, wildlife as food, and food sharing, are fundamental components of a cultural value system that emphasizes generosity, reciprocity, and cooperation, and usually operates within networks related to kinship and family social groups within the community (261–267). Alaska prohibits the sale of most wildlife hunted by Alaska Natives to non-Alaska Natives, but, across Canada, different jurisdictions recognize different Indigenous rights and responsibilities with respect to disposition of country food. For example, in Nunavut, an Inuk has the right to dispose freely to any person any wildlife lawfully harvested (268).

strategies could limit the effects of climate change
on Indigenous livelihoods and cultures. Indeed, we showed
that increasing harvest levels could accelerate the climateinduced
loss of good trapping habitats for marten (Figs. 5ix

strict conservation (Figs. 5ix and 5x; “conservation”). The
capacity of Indigenous communities to adapt to changing

times in the past. However, there are limits on adaptive capacity,
and the factors that maintain it still need to be investigated
and documented. Strategies could include the valorization
of traditional knowledge associated with the forest
types that will be more prevalent in the future. Strategies
to limit fire hazards at culturally significant locations,
species, and infrastructure should also be considered. Moreover,
diversifying landscape values that guide forest management
to take into account Indigenous values is advised. More
generally, a step toward collaboration with Indigenous peoples
in land management is needed to face the challenges
of environmental change. Collaborations between First Nation
