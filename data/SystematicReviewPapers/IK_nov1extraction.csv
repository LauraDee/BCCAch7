A.; Warren, S.; Yang, D. Q.","Analysis of in situ and satellite data shows evidence of different regional snow cover responses to the widespread warming and increasing winter precipitation that has characterized the Arctic climate for the past 40-50 years. The largest and most rapid decreases in snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow cover duration (SCD) are observed over maritime regions of the Arctic with the highest precipitation amounts. There is also evidence of marked differences in the response of snow cover between the North American and Eurasian sectors of the Arctic, with the North American sector exhibiting decreases in snow cover and snow depth over the entire period of available in situ observations from around 1950, while widespread decreases in snow cover are not apparent over Eurasia until after around 1980. However, snow depths are increasing in many regions of Eurasia. Warming and more frequent winter thaws are contributing to changes in snow pack structure with important implications for land use and provision of ecosystem services. Projected changes in snow cover from Global Climate Models for the 2050 period indicate increases in maximum SWE of up to 15% over much of the Arctic, with the largest increases (15-30%) over the Siberian sector. In contrast, SCD is projected to decrease by about 10-20% over much of the Arctic, with the smallest decreases over Siberia (<10%) and the largest decreases over Alaska and northern Scandinavia (30-40%) by 2050. These projected changes will have far-reaching consequences for the climate system, human activities, hydrology, and ecology.",2011,"DEC","Ambio","40","","17-31","WOS:000305284800004","10.1007/s13280-011-0212-y","","#1764","Callaghan 2011","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-27 05:25:19)(Select): discusses arctic changes in canada and alaska. includes IK of arctic animal movement in response to changing ice/snow cover driven by climate change. including. ;","IK",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"2","Managing California Black Oak for Tribal Ecocultural Restoration","Long, J. W.; Goode, R. W.; Gutteriez, R. J.; Lackey, J. J.; Anderson, M. K.","Many tribes in California and Oregon value California black oak (Quercus kelloggii) as a traditional source of food and other values. Over centuries or millennia, Native Americans learned that they could enhance production of desired resources by regularly igniting low-intensity surface fires in stands of black oak. Although black oak is likely to remain widespread in the future, a warming climate, increasingly dense forests, and altered fire regimes threaten the large, full-crowned mature trees that produce crops of high-quality acorns and provide cavities for many wildlife species. To examine the effects of different kinds of burns on tribal values including associated plants, fungi, and wildlife of special cultural significance, we reviewed and synthesized scientific studies of black oak in conjunction with interviews and workshops with tribal members who use the species and recall burning by their ancestors. We conducted two exploratory analyses to understand trends in large black oaks and potential tradeoffs regarding black oak restoration. Our findings identify opportunities for reintroducing low-intensity fire, in conjunction with thinning, to restore stands that are favorable for acorn gathering. We present examples of such projects and discuss how to overcome challenges in restoring the socioecological benefits of black oak ecosystems for tribes.",2017,"SEP","Journal of Forestry","115","5","426-434","WOS:000410540200016","10.5849/jof.16-033","","#7355","Long 2017","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-23 08:48:23)(Select): this is transboundary, Tribal-US boundaries, which we are including; Silvia Olvera-Hernandez (2024-08-23 04:37:48)(Select): It focuses on TEK and black oak, in a USA ecosystem that crosses to Mexico.

"3","Utilizing Photovoice to Support Indigenous Accounts of Environmental Change and Injustice","Mitchell, F. M.; Billiot, S.; Lechuga-Pena, S.","Global environmental changes can happen quickly or over extended periods and have compounding effects. Indigenous communities experience environmental changes that can lead to a decline in quality of life, illness or disease, and unwelcome cultural adaptations that extend to future generations. Due to limited resources and political marginalization, members of these communities may not be able to respond to or prevent these conditions. Cultural connections to the land and community, along with limited resources, impact Indigenous peoples' willingness and ability to relocate to different geographic locations experiencing less damaging ecological changes or environmental risk. In this article, we respond to the Special Issue prompt probing """"[m]ethods in which Indigenous communities engage within their environment and on the land to conduct research"""". We begin by describing environmental change, followed by a scoping review of Photovoice studies focused on environmental issues. Environmental changes affecting Indigenous groups are discussed, including a case study and a discussion of the ways that Photovoice can support and honor Indigenous peoples' connection to the natural environment. This article is not intended to be an exhaustive review, but rather seeks to understand how Photovoice is being used to respond to and document environmental change, and how such visual methodologies can be used in Indigenous communities.",2020,"JUN","GENEALOGY","4","2","","WOS:000617486100018","10.3390/genealogy4020051","","#8311","Mitchell 2020","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-23 07:21:54)(Select): c1: yes

"4","Local knowledge and practice in disaster relief: A worldwide cross-cultural comparison of coping mechanisms","Pierro, R.; Ember, C. R.; Pitek, E.; Skoggard, I.","There is a growing interest and urgency in understanding and incorporating local knowledge and strategies into sustainable climate change adaptation. This is particularly important because as populations age and new technologies come on the scene, much local knowledge is lost to newer generations. For this reason, we have systematically examined 90 societies from the ethnographic record to explore and document the strategies that people in the past have implemented in response to serious natural hazards. Our review reveals a rich diversity of coping mechanisms and contingency plans used by societies around the world in response to different hazards, particularly floods and droughts. We collect, classify, and compare different types of coping mechanisms, focusing on four major types: technological, subsistence, economic and religious. We find that most societies employ multiple types of coping mechanisms, although our data suggest that technological coping mechanisms are the most common coping mechanisms in response to fast-onset hazards, whereas religious coping mechanisms are the most common mechanism used in response to slow-onset hazards. We also find that religious and nonreligious coping strategies are not antithetical to each other. In fact, an increased number of religious coping mechanisms is associated with an increased number of """"practical"""", nonreligious coping mechanisms.",2022,"JUN 15","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION","76","","","WOS:000832968600001","10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.102988","","#9609","Pierro 2022","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-22 05:45:38)(Select): Documentation of shifts in adaptation techniques in relation to climate change & change-driven events such as fires.

"5","The Mittimatalik Siku Asijjipallianinga (Sea Ice Climate Atlas): How Inuit Knowledge, Earth Observations, and Sea Ice Charts Can Fill IPCC Climate Knowledge Gaps","Wilson, K.; Arreak, A.; Bell, T.; Ljubicic, G.; Sikumiut, Comm","The IPCC special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (SROCC) highlights with high confidence that declining Arctic sea ice extents and increased ship-based transportation are impacting the livelihoods of Arctic Indigenous peoples. Current IPCC assessments cannot address the local scale impacts and adaptive needs of Arctic Indigenous communities based on the global, top-down model approaches used. Inuit maintain the longest unrecorded climate history of sea ice in Canada, and to support Inuit community needs, a decolonized, Inuit knowledge-based approach was co-developed in the community of Mittimatalik, Nunavut (Canada) to create the Mittimatalik siku asijjipallianinga (sea ice climate atlas) 1997-2019. This paper presents the novel approach used to develop the atlas based on Inuit knowledge, earth observations and Canadian Ice Service (CIS) sea ice charts, and demonstrates its application. The atlas provides an adaptation tool that Mittimatalik can use to share locations of known and changing sea ice conditions to plan for safe sea ice travel. These maps can also be used to support the safety and situational awareness of territorial and national search and rescue partners, often coming from outside the region and having limited knowledge of local sea ice conditions. The atlas demonstrates the scientific merit of Inuit knowledge in environmental assessments for negotiating a proposal to extend the shipping seasons for the nearby Mary River Mine. The timing and rates of sea ice freeze-up (October-December) in Mittimatalik are highly variable. There were no significant trends to indicate that sea ice is freezing up later to support increased shipping opportunities into the fall. The atlas shows that the first 2 weeks of November are critical for landfast ice formation, and icebreaking at this time would compromise the integrity of the sea ice for safe travel, wildlife migration and reproduction into the winter months. There was evidence that sea ice break-up (May-July) and the fracturing of the nearby floe edge have been occurring earlier in the last 10 years (2010-2019). Shipping earlier into the break-up season could accelerate the break-up of an already declining sea ice travel season, that Inuit are struggling to maintain.",2021,"OCT 26","Frontiers in Climate","3","","","WOS:001021792700001","10.3389/fclim.2021.715105","","#13200","Wilson 2021","Laura  Dee (2024-08-30 23:20:53)(Select): Not a mention of biodiversity per se, but does impact NCPs and indigenous communities/boundaries . mentions species too """"This exposes Indigenous coastal communities to a higher risk of accidents, pollution, noise, invasive species, and disruptions to subsistence hunting areas, wildlife reproduction, populations, and migration routes (Huntington et al., 2015; ICC-Alaska, 2015; Meredith et al., 2019)."""" ; ","Biophysical; Human movement; IK; save for other sections",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
"6","Observations of environmental changes and potential dietary impacts in two communities in Nunavut, Canada","Nancarrow, T. L.; Chan, H. M.; Arbour, L.; Parkinson, A.; Kulig, J. C.","Introduction: Inuit from communities across the Arctic are still existing in subsistence living. Hunting, fishing and gathering is an important part of the culture and the harvested 'country food' provides sources of nutrients invaluable to maintaining the health of the populations. However, Inuit are voicing their concerns on how observed climate change is impacting on their traditional life. The objective of this study was to report on observed climate changes and how they affect the country food harvest in two communities in the Canadian Arctic. The nutritional implications of these changes are discussed and also how the communities need to plan for adaptations. Methods: A total of 17 adult participants from Repulse Bay and Kugaaruk, Nunavut were invited to participate. Participants were selected using purposeful sampling methods selecting the most knowledgeable community members for the study. Inuit Elders, hunters, processors of the animals, and other community members above the age of 18 years were selected for their knowledge of harvesting and the environment. Two-day bilingual focus groups using semi-directed, unstructured questions were held in each community to discuss perceived climate changes related to the access and availability of key species. Key topics of focus included ice, snow, weather, marine mammals, land mammals, fish, species ranges, migration patterns, and quality and quantity of animal populations. Maps were used to pinpoint harvesting locations. A qualitative analysis categorizing strategy was used for analysis of data. This strategy involves coding data in order to form themes and to allow for cross-comparison analysis between communities. Each major animal represented a category; other categories included land, sea, and weather. Results were verified by the participants and community leaders. Results: Three themes emerged from the observations: (1) ice/snow/water; (2) weather; and (3) changes in species. Climate change can affect the accessibility and availability of the key species of country foods including caribou, marine mammals, fish, birds and plants. Various observations on relationship between weather and population health and distributions of the animal/plant species were reported. While many of the observations were common between the two communities, many were community specific and inconsistent. Participants from both communities found that climate change was affecting the country food harvest in both positive and negative ways. Key nutrients that could be affected are protein, iron, zinc, n-3 fatty acids, selenium and vitamins D and A. Conclusion: Community members from Repulse Bay and Kugaaruk have confirmed that climate change is affecting their traditional food system. Local and regional efforts are needed to plan for food security and health promotion in the region, and global actions are needed to slow down the process of climate change.",2010,"","Circumpolar Special Issue: Human health at the ends of the earth.","10","2","Article-1370","","","","#21466","Nancarrow 2010","Tyler McIntosh (2024-09-11 06:01:05)(Select): not a review - surveys of community members;","Biotic; IK; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
