K.; Yano, M.","Agriculture is now facing the perfect storm' of climate change, increasing costs of fertilizer and rising food demands from a larger and wealthier human population. These factors point to a global food deficit unless the efficiency and resilience of crop production is increased. The intensification of agriculture has focused on improving production under optimized conditions, with significant agronomic inputs. Furthermore, the intensive cultivation of a limited number of crops has drastically narrowed the number of plant species humans rely on. A new agricultural paradigm is required, reducing dependence on high inputs and increasing crop diversity, yield stability and environmental resilience. Genomics offers unprecedented opportunities to increase crop yield, quality and stability of production through advanced breeding strategies, enhancing the resilience of major crops to climate variability, and increasing the productivity and range of minor crops to diversify the food supply. Here we review the state of the art of genomic-assisted breeding for the most important staples that feed the world, and how to use and adapt such genomic tools to accelerate development of both major and minor crops with desired traits that enhance adaptation to, or mitigate the effects of climate change.",2016,"APR","Plant Biotechnology Journal","14","4","1095-1098","WOS:000373069400004","10.1111/pbi.12467","","#19","Abberton 2016","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"2","The Importance of Water Availability to Bats: Climate Warming and Increasing Global Aridity","Adams, R. A.; Hayes, M. A.; Lim, B. K.; Fenton, M. B.; Brigham, R. M.; Mistry, S.; Kurta, A.; Gillam, E. H.; Russell, A.; Ortega, J.","Environmental change due to climate warming is accelerating in most of the world's arid regions, pushing already xeric ecosystems towards drier conditions and expanding desert landscapes. These changes will alter community structures and species interactions globally. Because many arid regions, especially semi-arid zones, are relatively high in bat species richness, reactions of bat populations to increasing and intensifying droughts will affect food web dynamics and ecosystem services on nearly every continent. Although there is evidence that some species have preadaptations for surviving decreasing available water resources in arid regions, many species may succumb to the pace of climate warming and landscape xerification. As drought and aridity increase, many drinking sources will inevitably be lost, increasing competition for progressively limited resources, thereby affecting bats during the reproductive season when they are most vulnerable. Herein, we review how climate warming and increasing drought are currently altering bat population dynamics and model future viability of some species and populations. Documented declines in some bat populations, reductions in species richness, and changes in distributional ranges are already occurring in hardest hit areas and some models have been developed to predict future outcomes for bats living on the leading edge of climate disruption.",2021,"","50 YEARS OF BAT RESEARCH: Foundations and New Frontiers","","","105-120","WOS:000747823400011","10.1007/978-3-030-54727-1_710.1007/978-3-030-54727-1","","#96","Adams 2021","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"3","A Review of Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Coffee Cultivation and Mycotoxigenic Fungi","Adhikari, M.; Isaac, E. L.; Paterson, R. R. M.; Maslin, M. A.","Coffee is one of the most traded commodities in the world. It plays a significant role in the global economy, employing over 125 million people. However, it is possible that this vital crop is threatened by changing climate conditions and fungal infections. This paper reviews how suitable areas for coffee cultivation and the toxigenic fungi species of Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium will be affected due to climate change. By combining climate models with species distribution models, a number of studies have investigated the future distribution of coffee cultivation. Studies predict that suitable coffee cultivation area could drop by similar to 50% under representation concentration pathway (RCP) 6.0 by 2050 for both Arabica and Robusta. These findings agree with other studies which also see an altitudinal migration of suitable cultivation areas to cooler regions, but limited scope for latitudinal migration owing to coffee's inability to tolerate seasonal temperature changes. Increased temperatures will see an overall increase in mycotoxin production such as aflatoxins, particularly in mycotoxigenic fungi (e.g., Aspergillus flavus) more suited to higher temperatures. Arabica and Robusta's limited ability to relocate means both species will be grown in less suitable climates, increasing plant stress and making coffee more susceptible to fungal infection and mycotoxins. Information regarding climate change parameters with respect to mycotoxin concentrations in real coffee samples is provided and how the changed climate affects mycotoxins in non-coffee systems is discussed. In a few areas where relocating farms is possible, mycotoxin contamination may decrease due to the """"parasites lost"""" phenomenon. More research is needed to include the effect of mycotoxins on coffee under various climate change scenarios, as currently there is a significant knowledge gap, and only generalisations can be made. Future modelling of coffee cultivation, which includes the influence of atmospheric carbon dioxide fertilisation and forest management, is also required; however, all indications show that climate change will have an extremely negative effect on future coffee production worldwide in terms of both a loss of suitable cultivation areas and an increase in mycotoxin contamination.",2020,"OCT","Microorganisms","8","10","","WOS:000585269900001","10.3390/microorganisms8101625","","#106","Adhikari 2020","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"4","The freezer defrosting: global warming and litter decomposition rates in cold biomes","Aerts, R.","1 Decomposition of plant litter, a key component of the global carbon budget, is hierarchically controlled by the triad: climate > litter quality > soil organisms. Given the sensitivity of decomposition to temperature, especially in cold biomes, it has been hypothesized that global warming will lead to increased litter decomposition rates, both through direct temperature effects and through indirect effects on litter quality and soil organisms. 2 A meta-analysis of experimental warming studies in cold biomes (34 site-species combinations) showed that warming resulted in slightly increased decomposition rates. However, this response was strongly dependent on the method used: open top chambers reduced decomposition rates, whereas heating lamps stimulated decomposition rates. The low responsiveness was mainly due to moisture-limited decomposition rates in the warming treatments, especially at mesic and xeric sites. This control of litter decomposition by both temperature and moisture was corroborated by natural gradient studies. 3 Interspecific differences in litter quality and decomposability are substantially larger than warming-induced phenotypic responses. Thus, the changes in the species composition and structure of plant communities that have been observed in medium-term warming studies in cold biomes will have a considerably greater impact on ecosystem litter decomposition than phenotypic responses. 4 Soil fauna communities in cold biomes are responsive to climate warming. Moreover, temperature-driven migration of the, hitherto absent, large comminuters to high-latitude sites may significantly increase decomposition rates. However, we do not know how far-reaching the consequences of changes in the species composition and structure of the soil community are for litter decomposition, as there is a lack of data on functional species redundancy and the species' dispersal ability. 5 Global warming will lead to increased litter decomposition rates only if there is sufficient soil moisture. Hence, climate scenario and experimental studies should focus more on both factors and their interaction. As interspecific differences in potential decomposability and litter chemistry are substantially larger than phenotypic responses to warming, the focus of future research should be on the former. In addition, more light should be shed on the below-ground 'darkness' to evaluate the ecological significance of warming-induced soil fauna community changes for litter decomposition processes in cold biomes.",2006,"JUL","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","94","4","713-724","WOS:000237972700001","10.1111/j.1365-2745.2006.01142.x","","#120","Aerts 2006","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

K.; Arko-Mensah, J.; Issah, I.; Acquah, A. A.; Hogarh, J. N.; Dwomoh, D.; Robins, T. G.; Fobil, J. N.","The rearing temperature of the immature stages can have a significant impact on the life-history traits and the ability of adult mosquitoes to transmit diseases. This review assessed published evidence of the effects of temperature on the immature stages, life-history traits, insecticide susceptibility, and expression of enzymes in the adult Anopheles mosquito. Original articles published through 31 March 2021 were systematically retrieved from Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. After applying eligibility criteria, 29 studies were included. The review revealed that immature stages of An. arabiensis were more tolerant (in terms of survival) to a higher temperature than An. funestus and An. quadriannulatus. Higher temperatures resulted in smaller larval sizes and decreased hatching and pupation time. The development rate and survival of An. stephensi was significantly reduced at a higher temperature than a lower temperature. Increasing temperatures decreased the longevity, body size, length of the gonotrophic cycle, and fecundity of Anopheles mosquitoes. Higher rearing temperatures increased pyrethroid resistance in adults of the An. arabiensis SENN DDT strain, and increased pyrethroid tolerance in the An. arabiensis SENN strain. Increasing temperature also significantly increased Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) expression and decreased insecticide toxicity. Both extreme low and high temperatures affect Anopheles mosquito development and survival. Climate change could have diverse effects on Anopheles mosquitoes. The sensitivities of Anopeheles mosquitoes to temperature differ from species to species, even among the same complex. Notwithstanding, there seem to be limited studies on the effects of temperature on adult life-history traits of Anopheles mosquitoes, and more studies are needed to clarify this relationship.",2021,"JUL","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","18","14","","WOS:000677349100001","10.3390/ijerph18147255","","#154","Agyekum 2021","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-10 06:47:59)(Select): some of the papers reviewed are from north america (see figure 2). paper touches on northward shifting disease vectors, transboundary in North America is implicit but not explicit; ","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"6","The Acadian Forest of New Brunswick in the 21st century what shifting heat and water balance imply for future stand dynamics and management","Albert, C.; Taylor, A. R.; Logan, T.; D'Orangeville, L.","Climate change is altering the dynamics of New Brunswick's forests. To mitigate the effects of climate change, it is cru-cial to account for future uncertainties in climate projections and natural disturbance trajectories when designing forestry practices. This paper presents the projected changes in key climatic drivers for New Brunswick's forests, examines the im-pacts of climate change on forest stand dynamics, and reviews adaptive silviculture tools for climate change adaptation. By 2071-2100, a projected 4-6 degrees C increase in mean annual temperature will lead to a 39%-77% rise in growing degree-days and a reduction in summer atmospheric water balance by 48-79 mm across New Brunswick. Foresters should anticipate a doubling of annual area burned, the northward migration of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens)), and the introduction of novel insects and diseases. Forest simulation models project a severe decline in boreal tree species abundance, including a 50% decline in balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton et al.), offset by an increase in temperate species, notably red maple (Acer rubrum L.; +200%) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh; +135%). Forests in the highlands and lowlands ecoregions, with 40%-50% and 15%-30% spruce and balsam fir composition, respectively, are particularly vulnerable. To limit climate change effects on forest values, foresters must prioritize climate resiliency in their management plans. Strategies should ensure the steady provision of forest goods and services under changing climatic conditions. Forest thinning enhances stand productivity and resilience, while shelterwood and two-age harvest balances timber production with diversity. Clearcutting, despite drawbacks, establishes younger, more vigorous forests with higher carbon se-questration potential. Assisted migration offers promise in helping threatened tree species adapt. Climate change will have a significant impact on New Brunswick's forests, leading to changes in key climatic drivers, increased risks of disturbances, and a shift toward more temperate tree species. However, there are existing adaptation strategies available. It is crucial to consider future uncertainties when designing and evaluating forestry practices, as this is essential for mitigating the effects of climate change on forest values and ensuring the continued provision of forest goods and services over time.",2023,"DEC","Environmental Reviews","31","4","690-706","WOS:001094677400001","10.1139/er-2022-0122","","#267","Albert 2023","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-13 09:30:01)(Select): partially a review, partially a modeling study. including, but the useful info may stem from the modeling and therefore have to decide if this meets the criteria of being a review; ","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"7","Habitat ecology of Nearctic-Neotropical migratory landbirds on the nonbreeding grounds","Albert, S.; Wolfe, J. D.; Kellerman, J.; Sherry, T.; Stutchbury, B. J. M.; Bayly, N. J.; Ruiz-Sánchez, A.","Of the approximately 716 bird species that breed in North America, 386 (54%) are considered Nearctic-Neotropical migrants by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In the past 50 yr, scores of these migratory species, including some once considered common, have declined dramatically. Nearctic-Neotropical migrants normally spend 6-8 months in tropical habitats, making the identification, availability, and management of Neotropical habitats critical issues for their conservation. Yet, for most species, complete and nuanced information about their use of tropical habitats and the relative effects of breeding vs. wintering conditions on survival, productivity, and population trends is not available, though many studies point to Neotropical overwintering habitats as being a strong driver of population change. Particularly important for long-distance Nearctic-Neotropical migrants is an understanding of how""""carry-over effects"""" arise and influence population trends when conditions on wintering grounds and tropical stopover areas affect subsequent reproductive performance on breeding grounds. For example, why some species show strong carry-over effects from tropical habitats while others do not is not fully understood. I n recent years, many studies have offered insights into these issues by taking advantage of new scientific methods and technological innovations. In this review, we explore threats facing North American breeding birds that migrate to the Neotropics, summarize knowledge of habitat selection and use on the wintering grounds, describe how conditions at one point in the annual cycle may manifest in subsequent seasons or life history stages, and discuss conservation concerns such as climate change and the potential for phenological mismatch.",2020,"NOV","Condor","122","4","","WOS:000612517800020","10.1093/condor/duaa055","","#269","Albert 2020","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

M.","As a result of human activities, an ever-increasing portion of Earth's natural landscapes now lie adjacent to agricultural lands. This border between wild and agricultural communities represents an agro-ecological interface, which may be populated with crop plants, weeds of crop systems, and non-crop plants that vary from exotic to native in origin. Plant viruses are important components of the agro-ecological interface because of their ubiquity, dispersal by arthropod vectors, and ability to colonize both crop and wild species. Here we provide an overview of research on plant-virus dynamics across this interface and suggest three research priorities: (1) an increased effort to identify and describe plant virus diversity and distribution in its entirety across agricultural and ecological boundaries; (2) multi-scale studies of virus transmission to develop predictive power in estimating virus propagation across landscapes; and (3) quantitative evaluation of the influence of viruses on plant fitness and populations in environmental contexts beyond crop fields. We close by emphasizing that agro-ecological interfaces are dynamic, influenced by the human-mediated redistribution of plants, vectors, and viruses around the world, climate change, and the development of new crops. Consideration of virus interactions within these environmentally complex systems promises new insight into virus, plant, and vector dynamics from molecular mechanisms to ecological consequences.",2014,"MAR","European Journal of Plant Pathology","138","3","529-547","WOS:000331657800009","10.1007/s10658-013-0317-1","","#286","Alexander 2014","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"9","Likely Geographic Distributional Shifts among Medically Important Tick Species and Tick-Associated Diseases under Climate Change in North America: A Review","Alkishe, A.; Raghavan, R. K.; Peterson, A. T.","Simple Summary North America is considered as an area likely to be significantly affected by global warming, with climate change causing markedly warmer winter temperatures in the United States in recent decades. Ticks are sensitive to changes in ambient abiotic conditions and, therefore, climate: they are poikilothermic, with the life stages of each species requiring specific sets of environmental conditions for successful development and survival. Our review focuses on (1) identifying and exploring suitable areas for the eight medically important vector tick species in North America; (2) exploring whether and how species' distributions are likely to shift in coming decades in response to climate change, and in what ways; (3) and providing a picture on the status of the tick-associated diseases in North America from the present to the future. Ticks rank high among arthropod vectors in terms of numbers of infectious agents that they transmit to humans, including Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Colorado tick fever, human monocytic ehrlichiosis, tularemia, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Increasing temperature is suspected to affect tick biting rates and pathogen developmental rates, thereby potentially increasing risk for disease incidence. Tick distributions respond to climate change, but how their geographic ranges will shift in future decades and how those shifts may translate into changes in disease incidence remain unclear. In this study, we have assembled correlative ecological niche models for eight tick species of medical or veterinary importance in North America (Ixodes scapularis, I. pacificus, I. cookei, Dermacentor variabilis, D. andersoni, Amblyomma americanum, A. maculatum, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus), assessing the distributional potential of each under both present and future climatic conditions. Our goal was to assess whether and how species' distributions will likely shift in coming decades in response to climate change. We interpret these patterns in terms of likely implications for tick-associated diseases in North America.",2021,"MAR","Insects","12","3","","WOS:000633782200001","10.3390/insects12030225","","#322","Alkishe 2021","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

H.; Allard, G.; Running, S. W.; Semerci, A.; Cobb, N.","Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.

"11","Understanding Hail in the Earth System","Allen, J. T.; Giammanco, I. M.; Kumjian, M. R.; Punge, H. J.; Zhang, Q. H.; Groenemeijer, P.; Kunz, M.; Ortega, K.","The processes leading to the development of hail and the distribution of these events worldwide are reviewed. Microphysical and physical characteristics of hail development are described to provide context of the notable gaps in our understanding of what drives hail to grow large, or what determines how it falls to the ground. Distributional characteristics of hail are explored, utilizing both surface observations of hailstones and remotely sensed observational data sets to identify opportunities and needs for new observations. These observational deficiencies contribute to our limited capacity to both forecast hail or its expected size and reduce the effectiveness of using favorable conditions for hail development as a proxy to frequency where observations are unavailable. Given the substantive influences of both climate variability and the changing Earth system on hail, the latest understanding of their contributions to risk are addressed. Applying this understanding of the distribution and physical characteristics of hail, the damage by hail to agriculture and insured property is assessed. Much remains unknown about the processes leading to hail growth and environmental controls on hail occurrence, size, and magnitude, particularly outside of the United States and Europe. A better understanding of the global occurrence of hail is also needed to better anticipate the hazard and associated impacts. Plain Language Summary The processes leading to the development of hail and the resulting distribution of these events worldwide are reviewed. Hail forms from small frozen embryos that are lofted into the updraft of a thunderstorm, subsequently encountering a region of supercooled water, and growing by either riming or accumulation. Contrary to popular belief, the suggestion that hailstones that take multiple up-and-down excursions through an updraft are not observed. Hail can grow to large sizes on any continent, and stones as large as 200 mm have been recorded. Damages associated with hail reach more than 10 billion U.S. dollars a year in North America alone. In this review a range of topics are covered, including characteristics of hail growth and development, surface observations of hail, remotely sensed observations, the approaches to forecasting hail and estimating its frequency where observations are unavailable, the influences of climate variability and a warming earth system and the impacts on insured property. Much remains unknown about the processes leading to hail growth and environmental controls on hail occurrence, size, and magnitude, particularly outside of the United States and Europe.

Through a systematic review of empirical literature on these blooms and invasions, we explore the prevalence of conventional analyses of environmental, economic, and social impacts, as well as opportunities for adaptation and valorisation. The study reveals crucial inconsistencies in the current evidence base on algae impacts: fragmented metrics for quantifying blooms and their effects; inconsistent application and testing of prevention measures (e.g. forecasting, early warning systems); reliance on removal as a management approach with limited evidence of associated costs; and scant evidence of the effectiveness of impact mitigation or adaptation strategies. With a focus on economic and societal dimensions of algae events, we introduce emerging opportunities within the blue economy for bloom utilization. The findings highlight the crucial need for harmonized monitoring protocols, robust cost-benefit analysis of management and adaptation options, and evidence of pathways to valorisation of algae biomass.",2024,"JAN 1","Environmental Research Letters","19","1","","WOS:001126176800001","10.1088/1748-9326/ad114c","","#340","Almela 2024","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"13","Forecasting the consequences of climate-driven shifts in human behavior on cetaceans","Alter, S. E.; Simmonds, M. P.; Brandon, J. R.","While climate change is expected to affect cetaceans primarily via loss of habitat and changes in prey availability, additional consequences may result from climate-driven shifts in human behaviors and economic activities. For example, increases in shipping, oil and gas exploration and fishing due to the loss of Arctic sea ice are highly likely to exacerbate acoustic disturbance, ship strikes, bycatch and prey depletion for Arctic cetaceans. In the tropics, climate change may result in increased hunting pressure on near-shore dolphins and whales off Asia, Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere as the availability of other marine resources diminishes. This study explores the range of potential consequences to cetaceans worldwide from predicted climate-driven shifts in human behavior, and evaluates the risks to particular species given their geographic ranges and habitat preferences. While concern about impacts of climate change on cetaceans has largely focused on polar species, the analysis presented here suggests tropical coastal and riverine cetaceans such as the lrawaddy dolphin, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, and finless porpoise are particularly vulnerable to those aspects of climate change that are mediated by changes in human behavior. Policy recommendations include the following: (1) information about cetacean populations should be incorporated into national, regional and international climate adaptation decisions wherever possible (for example, via GEF-sponsored adaptation initiatives); and (2) human-mediated impacts of climate change should be included in cetacean conservation and management plans, such as the management procedures of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), where possible. Because human responses to climate change are likely to evolve rapidly over the coming years and decades, it is important that local, regional and international cetacean conservation and management plans include regular reviews to allow them to adapt to new information.

R.; Mora, G.; Sáenz, F.; Calderón, B.; Mora, N.","This is Part II of a two-part review about climate and climate variability focused on the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) and the Caribbean Sea (CS). Both parts are aimed at providing oceanographers, marine biologists, and other ocean scientists, a guiding base for ocean-atmosphere interaction processes affecting the CS, the ETP, and the waters of Isla del Coco. Isla del Coco National Park is a Costa Rican World Heritage site. Part I analyzed the mean fields for both basins and a larger region covering 25 degrees S - 35 degrees N, 20 degrees W - 130 degrees W. Here we focus on a smaller area (65 degrees W - 95 degrees W, 0 degrees - 20 degrees N), as a complement to Part 1. Incoming solar radiation and surface energy fluxes reveal the complex nature of the ETP and CS for convective activity and precipitation on seasonal and intraseasonal time scales. Both regions are relevant as sources of evaporation and the associated moisture transport processes. The American Monsoon System influences the climate and climate variability of the ETP and CS, however, the precise way systems affect regional precipitation and transport of moisture, within the Intra Americas Sea (IAS) are not clear. Although the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CLLJ) is known to act as a conveyor belt for moisture transport, intraseasonal and seasonal modes of the CLLJ and their interactions with other IAS systems, have to be further investigated. Trans-isthmic jets, exert a variable seasonal wind stress force over the ocean surface co-generating regions of great marine productivity. Isolated convection, the seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the hurricane season, the Mid-Summer Drought, the seasonal and intraseasonal behavior of low-level jets and their interactions with transients, and the southward incursion of cold fronts contribute to regional seasonal precipitation. Many large-scale systems, such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO, also influence the variability of precipitation by modulating regional features associated with convection and precipitation. Monthly tropical storm (TS) activity in the CS and ETP basins is restricted to the period May-November, with very few cases in December. The CS presents TS peak activity during August, as well as for the number of hurricanes and major hurricanes, in contrast to the ETP that shows the same features during September. Rev. Biol.

In order to fully assess the role of peatlands on global C balance, now and in the future, it is imperative that we deepen our understanding of the relative contributions of various groups of microorganisms to organic matter transformations. Here, we review the drivers structuring fungal, bacterial and archaeal communities in natural peatlands and the response of these microbial communities to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, including fire, drainage, nutrient deposition, peat mining and climate change. The microbial diversity in peatlands is characterized by organisms that have developed physiological and metabolic adaptations to cope with the constraining conditions found in these ecosystems, such as low oxygen availability, cold temperature, acidity and oligotrophy. Furthermore, these unique organisms sometimes appear to be organized as repeat mosaics responding to vegetation, physicochemical and hydrological characteristics more than to geographical distance, in other words, similar to the much valued biodiversity aspects of the peatland vegetation itself and associated higher organisms. The response of microbial communities to disturbances is far from fully understood. In particular, whilst many studies have identified changes in microbial community composition or on microbially driven processes following a given disturbance, it remains unclear how the two components, diversity and function, relate with each other. Future challenges involve designing studies that will test whether ecological theories like species sorting, stress physiology, temporal niche or functional redundancy can be used to understand what regulates microbial populations and activity in peatlands, and studies that will allow us to predict more accurately how peatlands respond to global change or anthropogenic disturbances.

Agriculture is expected to contribute more, but is under pressure in both high-income and developing countries to do so more sustainably and inclusively. This paper reviews the roles of food policy in this changing setting. It begins by revisiting the case for keeping food markets open to international trade, investment and technology transfer, and concludes that openness is even more important, especially for developing countries, as the climate becomes warmer and more volatile. It then summarizes trade-related food policy developments globally in the 50 years prior to the global financial crisis, and in the price-spike periods since then. The current situation is calling for more action - including from agriculture - to mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss. The scope for re-purposing food policies to better meet these demands is then assessed. It proposes some alternatives to current measures that could better achieve national societal objectives while simultaneously benefitting the rest of the world in terms of easing natural resource and environmental stresses and reducing national and global poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, and inequalities in income, wealth and health. The review concludes by noting areas where further research could facilitate such transformations in food policies.",2022,"MAY","Food Policy","109","","","WOS:000806138100005","10.1016/j.foodpol.2022.102253","","#445","Anderson 2022","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-28 08:29:02)(Select): tagging as human movement since that full section title is human movement & trade; Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-28 08:28:29)(Select): c1: yes

However, tidepools also shelter a rich fauna, including fishes, which display a wide diversity and a variety of ecological interactions and functions. Here, we review the diversity, ecology, evolution and conservation of the American tidepool fishes, from definition to trophic roles, ecological vulnerabilities and societal importance that reveal an extraordinary biodiversity and the important roles fishes play in the coastal ecosystems. Tidepool fish studies increased sharply from the mid twentieth century onwards, but many geographic gaps still exist. Tidepool fishes connect marine and terrestrial communities via substantial predation upon insects and exporting energy to land as prey for terrestrial fauna. Sea-level rise driven by climate change will reduce or eliminate current intertidal habitats, where little or no space is available for landward accommodation in the supralittoral zone. Concurrently, tidepool habitat would be 'squeezed' to a narrow intertidal stripe by 'coastal squeeze' process. Endemic, habitat-restricted, and specialist species could be particularly affected by human-induced habitat loss on the coastal stripe. Tidepool fishes provide many ecological services, such as well-being, environmental awareness, outdoor recreation, and bioinspiration for ancient and current societies.

H.","Perennial fruit crops are produced across a wide variety of climates and geographical settings worldwide. As specialty crops with relatively high input costs, farmgate value, and multiple-year production cycles, they require high levels of management and are susceptible to a large number of weather- and climate-related impacts. This review considers eight economically important perennial crops grown that share similar environmental limitations: tree fruits apple, pear, sour (tart) cherry, sweet cherry, peach, apricot, plum, and vining fruit grapes. While the global area on which these crops is produced is limited with just under 2 million hectares or about 2.8% of total global non-forage related cropland (FAO, 2018), their economic impact is significant. For example, in the United States during 2016 these crops collectively had a net farmgate value of just under $11.9 billion on a production area of only 661,000 ha (NASS USDA, 2017). In contrast to some agricultural crops, crop quality is typically of greater importance in the production cycle than crop yield and quantity. Major weather and climate-related constraints include temperature fluctuations and extremes, especially spring freezes, insufficient or untimely rainfall, hail, and pressure from a variety of weather-dependent plant disease and insect pests. Recent climatic changes have resulted in a longer and warmer growing season in many production areas, with some regions becoming too warm to meet cool season chilling requirements. Impacts from projected future changes in climate include a continuation of recent trends, a potential poleward shift for some crop production areas, and the introduction of new and exotic pest species.",2019,"","AGROCLIMATOLOGY: LINKING AGRICULTURE TO CLIMATE","60","","425-452","WOS:000667934200017","10.2134/agronmonogr60.2016.001610.2134/agronmonogr60","","#468","Andresen 2019","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-31 01:18:01)(Select): adding sociocultural and biotic tags.

P.; Fyfe, C.; Yates, M.; Khusro, M.","To understand how researchers are tackling globally important issues, it is crucial to identify whether current research is comprehensive enough to make substantive predictions about general responses. We examined how research on climate change affecting insects is being assessed, what factors are being tested and the localities of studies, from 1703 papers published between 1985 and August 2012. Most published research (64%) is generated from Europe and North America and being dedicated to core data analysis, with 29% of the studies analysed dedicated to Lepidoptera and 22% Diptera: which are well above their contribution to the currently identified insect species richness (estimated at 13% and 17% respectively). Research publications on Coleoptera fall well short of their proportional contribution (19% of publications but 39% of insect species identified), and to a lesser extent so do Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera. Species specific responses to changes in temperature by assessing distribution/range shifts or changes in abundance were the most commonly used methods of assessing the impact of climate change on insects. Research on insects and climate change to date is dominated by manuscripts assessing butterflies in Europe, insects of economic and/or environmental concern in forestry, agriculture, and model organisms. The research on understanding how insects will respond to a rapidly changing climate is still in its infancy, but the current trends of publications give a good basis for how we are attempting to assess insect responses. In particular, there is a crucial need for broader studies of ecological, behavioural, physiological and life history responses to be addressed across a greater range of geographic locations, particularly Asia, Africa and Australasia, and in areas of high human population growth and habitat modification. It is still too early in our understanding of taxa responses to climate change to know if charismatic taxa, such as butterflies, or disease vectors, including Diptera, can be used as keystone taxa to generalise other insect responses to climate change. This is critical as the basic biology of most species is still poorly known, and dominant, well studied taxa may show variable responses to climate change across their distribution due to regional biotic and abiotic influences. Indeed identifying if insect responses to climate change can be generalised using phylogeny, functional traits, or functional groups, or will populations and species exhibit idiosyncratic responses, should be a key priority for future research.",2013,"FEB 12","PeerJ","1","","","WOS:000209185300010","10.7717/peerj.11","","#474","Andrew 2013","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

K.","This paper reviews trends in the academic literature on cumulative effects assessment (CEA) of disturbance on forest ecosystems to advance research in the broader context of impact assessments. Disturbance is any distinct spatiotemporal event that disrupts the structure and composition of an ecosystem affecting resource availability. We developed a Python package to automate search term selection, write search strategies, reduce bias and improve the efficient and effective selection of articles from academic databases and grey literature. We identified 148 peer-reviewed literature published between 1986 and 2022 and conducted an inductive and deductive thematic analysis of the results. Our findings revealed that CEA studies are concentrated in the global north, with most publications from authors affiliated with government agencies in the USA and Canada. Methodological and analytical approaches are less interdisciplinary but mainly quantitative and expert-driven, involving modeling the impacts of disturbances on biophysical valued components. Furthermore, the assessment of socioeconomic valued components, including the effects of disturbance on Indigenous wellbeing connected to forests, has received less attention. Even though there is a high preference for regional assessment, challenges with data access, quality, and analysis, especially baseline data over long periods, are hampering effective CEA. Few articles examined CEA - policy/management nexus. Of the few studies, challenges such as the inadequate implementation of CEA mitigation strategies due to policy drawbacks and resource constraints, the high cost of monitoring multiple indicators, and poor connections between scenarios/modeling and management actions were paramount. Future CEA research is needed to broaden our understanding of how multiple disturbance affects forests in the global south and coupled social and ecological systems and their implications for sustainable forest management.",2022,"SEP 1","Journal of Environmental Management","317","","","WOS:000833534000001","10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115277","","#513","Antwi 2022","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Using a systematic literature review, we examined reports on forest management practices implemented in response to climate change, specifically focusing on governance and institutional arrangements that either support or limit climate change adaptation and mitigation responses. Our literature sample size of 24 documents suggests that the body of literature reporting on adaptation and mitigation practices in forest management is scarce. Governments remain the dominant actors providing funding and leading the implementation and reporting of climate change adaptation practices, primarily in response to national or international climate change commitments. Forest practices such as enhanced silviculture, assisted migration, and nature -based solutions were the most frequently reported. However, given the scarcity of literature, it is difficult to conclude the scope of climate change adaptation practice uptake in Canada. Barriers such as lack of information/data, inter -jurisdictional knowledge transfer, policy conflicts, forest tenure models, technical capacity gaps, and economic barriers to adaptation need to be overcome to strengthen climate change response in forest management.

J.","Forest succession is a dynamic process of progressive compositional development of ecological communities of species following natural or anthropogenic disturbance. Despite a rich history of conceptual frameworks, models, and empirical advances, the complex interactions among climatic conditions, disturbances, edaphic factors, and silvicultural treatments still challenge our ability to accurately predict forest succession, hindering application to forest management. Our goal was to improve understanding of forest succession in the managed boreal forests of North America by clarifying advances in knowledge and limitations in our understanding. We reviewed 152 peer-reviewed papers to: (i) document conceptual developments in forest succession; (ii) summarize drivers of North American boreal forest succession, including changes to forest composition and successional trajectories given climate change; and (iii) discuss the implications of the synthesized information for boreal forest management. While the element of stochasticity is expected to increase under climate change, successional dynamics are anticipated to remain predominantly deterministic. Southern boreal forests are at increased risk of mortality due to warming-driven drought and increased fires. Following disturbance, regeneration is likely to favor deciduous hardwoods. In boreal mixedwoods, increased fires would promote jack pine, and also black spruce on hydric and xeric sites. Dynamics of the northern boreal will depend on the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration. Forest management must carefully select prescriptions to promote forest regeneration and composition that consider the long-term effects of changing climate and disturbance regimes. For instance, combining retention cut with mechanical site preparation would maintain site productivity and reverse open black spruce stand development in northern boreal stands. Our work shows that multiple disturbances have compounding effects on forest development, but further work is needed to better define thresholds for synergistic and buffering interactions. Modeling of boreal forest succession can be improved by incorporating more of the influential factors, but this is often limited by the lack of data. This information will guide the development of forest management strategies by exploring combinations of prescribed fire and variable intensity selection cutting systems to reproduce the effects of multiple interacting natural disturbances under climate change on successional dynamics.",2022,"2022 AUG 19","Environmental Reviews","","","","WOS:000844986800001","10.1139/er-2021-0106","","#520","Anyomi 2022","","Biotic; Intervention; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

D.","Woody vegetation in grasslands and savannas has increased worldwide over the past 100-200 years. This phenomenon of """"woody plant encroachment"""" (WPE) has been documented to occur at different times but at comparable rates in rangelands of the Americas, Australia, and southern Africa. The objectives of this chapter are to review (1) the process of WPE and its causes, (2) consequences for ecosystem function and the provision of services, and (3) the effectiveness of management interventions aimed at reducing woody cover. Explanations for WPE require consideration of multiple interacting drivers and constraints and their variation through time at a given site. Mean annual precipitation sets an upper limit to woody plant cover, but local patterns of disturbance (fire, browsing) and soil properties (texture, depth) prevent the realization of this potential. In the absence of these constraints, seasonality, interannual variation, and intensity of precipitation events determine the rate and extent of woody plant expansion. Although probably not a triggering factor, rising atmospheric CO2 levels may have favored C-3 woody plant growth. WPE coincided with the global intensification of livestock grazing that by reducing fine fuels, hence fire frequency and intensity, facilitated WPE. From a conservation perspective, WPE threatens the maintenance of grassland and savanna ecosystems and its endemic biodiversity. Traditional management goals aimed at restoring forage and livestock production after WPE have broadened to support a more diverse portfolio of ecosystem services. Accordingly, we focus on how WPE and management actions aimed at reducing woody plant cover influence carbon sequestration, water yield, and biodiversity, and discuss the trade-offs involved when balancing competing management objectives.",2017,"","RANGELAND SYSTEMS: PROCESSES, MANAGEMENT AND CHALLENGES","","","25-84","WOS:000429304800003","10.1007/978-3-319-46709-2_210.1007/978-3-319-46709-2","","#548","Archer 2017","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-28 02:29:08)(Select): c1: yes (note: this is a book chapter)

Y.","Water scarcity is exacerbating in many regions across North America because of climate change compounded by population growth, overexploitation of freshwater resources, and lack of proper management. Considering the regional urgency, there is an immense need to find more equitable solutions for water management. Therefore, this paper aims to examine the climatic factors impacting the hydrological regime in North America, including changes in surface runoff, groundwater storage, and the forested watershed, based on current trends and future projection scenarios. Moreover, this paper critically overviews need-based solutions for effective water management at a regional scale. The study shows that many areas of North America are exposed to extreme events such as prolonged droughts, devastating floods, wildfires, and altering precipitation patterns. Consequently, these changes are triggering wide-ranging impacts on water resources, leading to water supply deficiencies and influencing water flows and quality in the Southwestern United States, prairie provinces in Canada, and Mexico. The projection of warming around the region experiences spatial and seasonal variations because of the diversity in climatic conditions. Overall, in North America, winter is expected to warm more than other seasons causing earlier runoff and a decline in snowmelt. Given the physical and economic constraints that limit the development of new utilities, emphasis should be placed on strengthening nature-based solutions such as green infrastructure.

A.; Keshavmurthy, S.; Chen, A.; Schleyer, M. H.; Sheppard, C. R. C.","Most reviews concerning the impact of climate change on coral reefs discuss independent effects of warming or ocean acidification. However, the interactions between these, and between these and direct local stressors are less well addressed. This review underlines that coral bleaching, acidification, and diseases are expected to interact synergistically, and will negatively influence survival, growth, reproduction, larval development, settlement, and post-settlement development of corals. Interactions with local stress factors such as pollution, sedimentation, and overfishing are further expected to compound effects of climate change. Reduced coral cover and species composition following coral bleaching events affect coral reef fish community structure, with variable outcomes depending on their habitat dependence and trophic specialisation. Ocean acidification itself impacts fish mainly indirectly through disruption of predation- and habitat-associated behavior changes. Zooxanthellate octocorals on reefs are often overlooked but are substantial occupiers of space; these also are highly susceptible to bleaching but because they tend to be more heterotrophic, climate change impacts mainly manifest in terms of changes in species composition and population structure. Non-calcifying macroalgae are expected to respond positively to ocean acidification and promote microbe-induced coral mortality via the release of dissolved compounds, thus intensifying phase-shifts from coral to macroalgal domination. Adaptation of corals to these consequences of CO2 rise through increased tolerance of corals and successful mutualistic associations between corals and zooxanthellae is likely to be insufficient to match the rate and frequency of the projected changes. Impacts are interactive and magnified, and because there is a limited capacity for corals to adapt to climate change, global targets of carbon emission reductions are insufficient for coral reefs, so lower targets should be pursued. Alleviation of most local stress factors such as nutrient discharges, sedimentation, and overfishing is also imperative if sufficient overall resilience of reefs to climate change is to be achieved.

R.; Delagrange, S.; Kebli, H.; Messier, C.; Shipley, B.; Valladares, F.; Kattge, J.; Boisvert-Marsh, L.; McKenney, D.","The integration of functional traits into vulnerability assessments is a promising approach to quantitatively capture differences in species sensitivity and adaptive capacity to climate change, allowing the refinement of tree species distribution models. In response to a clear need to identify traits that are responsive to climate change and applicable in amanagement context, we review the state of knowledge of the main mechanisms, and their associated traits, that underpin the ability of boreal and temperate tree species to persist and (or) shift their distribution in a changing climate. We aimed to determine whether current knowledge is sufficiently mature and available to be used effectively in vulnerability assessments. Marshalling recent conceptual advances and assessing data availability, our ultimate objective is to guide modellers and practitioners in finding and selecting sets of traits that can be used to capture differences in species' ability to persist and migrate. While the physiological mechanisms that determine sensitivity to climate change are relatively well understood (e.g., drought-induced cavitation), manyassociated traits have not been systematically documented for North American trees and differences in methodology preclude their widespread integration into vulnerability assessments (e.g., xylem recovery capacity). In contrast, traits traditionally associated with the ability to migrate and withstand fire are generally well documented, but new key traits are emerging in the context of climate change that have not been as well characterized (e.g., age of optimum seed production). More generally, lack of knowledge surrounding the extent and patterns in intraspecific trait variation, as well as co-variation and interaction among traits, limit our ability to use this approach to assess tree adaptive capacity. We conclude by outlining research needs and potential strategies for the development of trait-based knowledge applicable in large-scale modelling efforts, sketching out important aspects of trait data organization that should be part of a coordinated effort by the forest science community.",2016,"JUN","Environmental Reviews","24","2","164-186","WOS:000377123600006","10.1139/er-2015-0072","","#649","Aubin 2016","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

M.; Monroy-Vilchis, O.","Habitat connectivity is essential to mitigate the effects of fragmentation by maintaining ecological processes, exchange of individuals, and gene flow among isolated populations. In the last two decades, the importance of habitat connectivity has been highlighted and the number of studies that address this issue has increased. We review and describe the habitat-connectivity studies for the Carnivora in the Americas to identify taxonomic, geographic, and methodological biases, and we examine the number of publications on habitat connectivity and their relationship with country-level parameters. We reviewed habitat-connectivity studies published between 2000 and 2020. We quantified studies by region, country, family, and species. We identified information gaps and analysed each country based on the proportion of land modified by humans, species richness, percentage of carnivoran species that are at risk of extinction, and the percentage of territory that is within Protected Areas. G-tests were performed to verify if the number of published connectivity studies differed based on these variables. There is an increasing trend in the number of studies; however, this increasing is not proportional among countries, among families, or among carnivoran species. We identified that there is a regional bias, since more than 75% of the studies were carried out in North America, in addition, taxonomic bias indicates that the studies focused on large carnivorans. Regarding the methodological bias, the least-cost path was the most used approach. There are fewer studies on habitat connectivity in countries with higher fragmentation rates, higher percentages of species that are at risk of extinction and less percentage of land in Protected Areas. The capability of countries to invest in research, the study focused on large charismatic species and the difficulty to obtaining dispersion data are factors that have influenced in the study of habitat connectivity.",2023,"APR","Mammal Review","53","2","99-115","WOS:000941062600001","10.1111/mam.12312","","#789","Balbuena-Serrano 2023","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-17 03:58:04)(Select): most relevant for interventions section but including because the paper mentions transboundary grizzly corridors between US and Canada.

E.; Matthews, N.; Milner-Gulland, E. J.; Smith, P.; Walmsley, S.; Young, L.","Humankind faces a Triple Challenge: averting dangerous climate change, reversing biodiversity loss, and supporting the wellbeing of a growing population. Action to address each of these issues is inherently dependent on action to address the others. Local, national, and international policy goals on climate change, biological diversity, and human wellbeing have been set. Current implementation measures are insufficient to meet these goals, but the Triple Challenge can still be met if governments, corporations, and other stakeholders take a holistic perspective on management of land and waters. To inform this effort, we identify a set of priority policy responses drawn from recent international assessments that, whilst not being the only potential solutions, can form the core of such a holistic approach. We do this through an iterative process using three methodological approaches: (i) structured literature review; (ii) deliberative expert analysis; and (iii) wider consultation, before synthesizing into this paper. Context-appropriate implementation of responses will be needed to capitalize on potential policy synergies and to ensure that unavoidable trade-offs between management of land and waters for climate mitigation, biodiversity restoration, and human wellbeing outcomes are made explicit. We also set out four approaches to managing trade-offs that can promote fair and just transitions: (1) social and economic policy pivoting towards 'inclusive wealth'; (2) more integrated policymaking across the three areas; (3) 'Triple Challenge dialogues' among state and non-state actors; and (4) a new research portfolio to underpin (1), (2), and (3).Key policy insights:Multiple recent global assessments provide a strong scientific basis for action on each of the three aspects of the Triple Challenge - climate, biodiversity, and human wellbeing (with a focus on food and nutrition) - but they do not provide an integrated perspective on how to address them simultaneously.Synthesis of these assessments identifies a portfolio of five core policy responses that deliver across the Triple Challenge: (i) rapidly cutting fossil fuel use; (ii) promoting sustainable, healthy diets; (iii) increasing food productivity and cutting food loss and waste; (iv) implementing nature-based solutions at scale; and (v) strengthening governance and management of land and waters.Even with widespread implementation of that portfolio, trade-offs between climate, biodiversity, and wellbeing outcomes might be unavoidable.

"31","Environmental Evaluation: Lessons Learned from Case Studies","Banjoko, B.; Eslamian, S.","Drought is a compelling global environmental phenomenon, and meteorological conditions have been observed to be the most important factors in the evolution of drought. Manifestations of drought vary from place to place but water deficit underpins all types of these manifestations. The impact of drought can be overwhelming, and environmental evaluation enables the determination of the degree of impact, which is normally classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Some of these environmental evaluations include air, temperature, rainfall (precipitation), soil temperature, crop performance, and occurrence of El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, there is no single method that can properly capture the onset and the severity of drought; hence, multiple approaches are being utilized for detection and mitigation. Satellites, computers, communication and information technology, modeling, and mathematical algorithms are some of the technologies employed in the environmental evaluation of drought. Being a global disaster, there is a need for international cooperation in information sharing and technological transfer, training, and capacity building with regard to drought prediction, monitoring, mitigation, and management, particularly with respect to developing countries. Continuous environmental evaluation and more research are desirable in drought management, particularly the interfaces between drought and other related extreme events like floods and forest fires.

G.; Salcedo-Sanz, S.","Heat waves (HWs) can cause large socioeconomic and environmental impacts. The observed increases in their frequency, intensity and duration are projected to continue with global warming. This review synthesizes the state of knowledge and scientific challenges. It discusses different aspects related to the definition, triggering mechanisms, observed changes and future projections of HWs, as well as emerging research lines on subseasonal forecasts and specific types of HWs. We also identify gaps that limit progress and delineate priorities for future research. Overall, the physical drivers of HWs are not well understood, partly due to difficulties in the quantification of their interactions and responses to climate change. Influential factors convey processes at different spatio-temporal scales, from global warming and the large-scale atmospheric circulation to regional and local factors in the affected area and upwind regions. Although some thermodynamic processes have been identified, there is a lack of understanding of dynamical aspects, regional forcings and feedbacks, and their future changes. This hampers the attribution of regional trends and individual events, and reduces the ability to provide accurate forecasts and regional projections. Sustained observational networks, models of diverse complexity, narrative-based methodological approaches and artificial intelligence offer new opportunities toward process-based understanding and interdisciplinary research. Plain Language Summary Heat waves (HWs) are climate extremes of major societal concern whose frequency, intensity and duration will continue increasing during this century. This review synthesizes the physical understanding and the main scientific challenges. We discuss problems involved in HW definition, including the diversity of HW indicators, and the consideration of adaptive capabilities in a changing climate. We also review observed and projected trends and the associated atmospheric patterns in different areas of the globe, with special attention to the mechanisms and drivers responsible for HW occurrence. These act at different scales, from planetary to local, and include thermodynamic and dynamical processes. There is a limited and fragmentary understanding of the interactions among these processes on regional scales, and their changes under global warming. Process-based understanding will benefit HW forecasts at time horizons longer than weather predictions, attribution of HW trends and events to human activities, and regional climate projections.

L.; Aw, T. G.; Luo, L. F.; Rose, J. B.","There is a growing concern about continued impairment of aquatic ecosystems resulting from increasing population size, land use, climate change, and the feedbacks that may harm human well-being. We describe a 100 year multi-disciplinary overview of changes in Lake St. Clair, North America to identify knowledge gaps and needs to build the foundation for creating coupled human and natural system models. Our historical analysis indicates that the socioeconomic dynamics are inextricably linked to the urban dynamics of the Detroit metropolitan area. Environmental degradation and human health issues led to the adoption of relevant policies, including construction of wastewater treatment facilities by the 1960s. Climate trends during the 100-year period indicate a wetter region, which is influencing lake levels. Since the mid-1980s and 90s invasive zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugenis) have significantly altered the ecological. structure and function of the lake. Waterborne illnesses due to contaminated drinking water were once an issue but current human health risks have shifted to contaminated recreational waters and coastal pollution. Key research needs for building coupled models include geo-referencing socioeconomic and ecological data to accurately represent the processes occurring within the political and watershed boundaries; assessing ecosystem services for human well-being; and developing research hypotheses and management options regarding interactions among land use, people and the lake. Lake St. Clair has gone through extensive changes, both socioeconomically and ecologically over the last 100 years and we suggest that it serves as a useful case study for the larger Great Lakes region.

L.","In light of current global changes to ecosystem function (e.g. climate change, trophic downgrading, and invasive species), there has been a recent surge of interest in exploring differences in nutrient cycling among ecosystem types. In particular, a growing awareness has emerged concerning the importance of scavenging in food web dynamics, although no studies have focused specifically on exploring differences in carrion consumption between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In this forum we synthesize the scavenging literature to elucidate differences in scavenging dynamics between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and identify areas where future research is needed to more clearly understand the role of carrion consumption in maintaining ecosystem function within each of these environments. Although scavenging plays a similar functional role in terrestrial and aquatic food webs, here we suggest that several fundamental differences exist in scavenging dynamics among these ecosystem types due to the unique selection pressures imposed by the physical properties of water and air. In particular, the movement of carcasses in marine ecosystems (e.g. wave action, upwelling, and sinking) diffuses biological activity associated with scavenging and decomposition across large, three-dimensional spatial scales, creating a unique spatial disconnect between the processes of production, scavenging, and decomposition, which in contrast are tightly linked in terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, the limited role of bacteria and temporal stability of environmental conditions on the sea floor appears to have facilitated the evolution of a much more diverse community of macrofauna that relies on carrion for a higher portion of its nutrient consumption than is present in terrestrial ecosystems. Our observations are further discussed as they pertain to the potential impacts of climate change and trophic downgrading (i.e. removal of apex consumers from ecosystems) on scavenging dynamics within marine and terrestrial ecosystems.",2012,"JUL","Oikos","121","7","1021-1026","WOS:000305614300004","10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20353.x","","#973","Beasley 2012","Grace Westphal (2024-08-13 09:02:40)(Select): Only the last two pages (1/3 of article) focus on climate change impacts on carrion cycling.

The threats to coastal biodiversity are numerous and include air and water pollution; over exploitation and harvesting; the introduction of exotic species; the dramatic loss of habitat due to urbanization, agricultural expansion, and other land use changes; and the potentially serious effects of global climate change. These threats suggest the need for swift action at a number of jurisdictional and governmental levels. Major components of such an effort are identified and described.

F.","AimTo analyse global patterns of climate during the mid-Holocene and conduct comparisons with pre-industrial and projected future climates. In particular, to assess the exposure of terrestrial biomes and ecoregions to climate-related risks during the Holocene-Anthropocene transition starting at the pre-industrial period. LocationTerrestrial ecosystems of the Earth. MethodsWe calculated long-term climate differences (anomalies) between the mid-Holocene (6 ka cal bp, mH), pre-industrial conditions and projections for 2100 (middle-strength A1B scenario) using six global circulation models available for all periods. Climate differences were synthesized with multivariate statistics and average principal component loadings of temperature and precipitation differences (an estimate of climate-related risks) were calculated on 14 biomes and 766 ecoregions. ResultsOur results suggest that most of the Earth's biomes will probably undergo changes beyond the mH recorded levels of community turnover and range shifts because the magnitude of climate anomalies expected in the future are greater than observed during the mH. A few biomes, like the remnants of North American and Euro-Asian prairies, may experience only slightly greater degrees of climate change in the future as compared with the mH. In addition to recent studies that have identified equatorial regions as the most sensitive to future climate change, we find that boreal forest, tundra and vegetation of the Equatorial Andes could be at greatest risk, since these regions will be exposed to future climates that are well outside natural climate variation during the Holocene. ConclusionsThe Holocene-Anthropocene climate transition, even for a middle-strength future climate change scenario, appears to be of greater magnitude and different from that between the mH and the pre-industrial period. As a consequence, community- and biome-level changes due to of expected climate change may be different in the future from those observed during the mH.",2014,"FEB","Global Ecology and Biogeography","23","2","235-244","WOS:000329139600010","10.1111/geb.12097","","#1063","Benito-Garzón 2014","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Most of these lands are peatlands (i.e., bogs and fens), which store over half of the total carbon in the biome. Because climate warming threatens to alter the carbon stocks of peatlands, much attention has been devoted to understanding the climatic and hydrologic conditions that affect peatland biogeochemistry. However, there are other aquatic systems that are widespread in the boreal forest that also process and store carbon, including lakes and ponds. Although non-peatland aquatic systems cover a much smaller portion of the boreal landscape, they still contain approximately 15% of the total carbon pool for the biome, much of it stored as either profundal or littoral sediments. Further, the carbon dynamics of boreal lakes are dynamically coupled to watershed processes. Excepting major disturbances to boreal catchments, such as forest fires and forest harvest, surface waters are the only locations of net loss of carbon to the atmosphere. Our objectives are to review what is known about factors that affect lake ecosystem carbon dynamics in the boreal forest and to identify areas of study that we deem to be profitable for forecasting the impacts of climate change on carbon pools and flux rates. We primarily focus on the boreal forest of North America, but recognize that our findings may also be relevant for boreal areas of Fennoscandia and Russia. The following research priorities are identified: (i) estimation of carbon pools in profundal and littoral sediments across the boreal forest, (ii) warming experiments that include quantification of ecosystem carbon dynamics in addition to measuring changes to aquatic food web structure, (iii) whole system experiments to understand the hydrologic and biogeochemical conditions by which allochthonous carbon is integrated into aquatic food webs, especially in the context of increased nutrient concentrations associated with a warmer, and possibly drier, climate, as forecast for the southern boreal forest, (iv) watershed-scale assessment of carbon budgets for lakes that straddle transitional zones between the boreal forest and prairie-parkland, temperate forest or tundra, to detect evidence of ecosystem migration, and (v) integration of lacustrine carbon pools and flux rates into carbon budgets at scales that range from local watersheds to the boreal forest biome.",2007,"","Environmental Reviews","15","","175-189","WOS:000253048300009","10.1139/A07-006","","#1078","Benoy 2007","Elliott Parsons (2024-08-27 08:52:15)(Select): 1 = yes (this is a review), 2 = yes (ecosystem migration is mentioned so flow is biotic, and climate change is considered), 3 = biodiversity is mentioned - see page 183, 4 = yes, within NA geography, 5 yes (see ecosystem migration, and as southern range of boreal forest is in US, this implies a shift over the border).

It is anticipated that disease incidence will increase due to a warming climate, given that habitats are expanding for reservoir hosts and vectors, particularly in Canada. Little is known about the ecology of primary vectors that perpetuate these orthobunyaviruses, including the viral transmission cycle and the impact of climatic and landscape factors.Methods: A scoping review was conducted to describe the current state of knowledge on the epidemiology of orthobunyaviruses relevant to Canada. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines was used to characterize studies focused on vector species. A literature search was conducted in six databases and gray literature. Eligible studies characterized orthobunyavirus epidemiology related to vector species, including viral competency, geospatial distributions, seasonal trends, and/or risk factors.Results: A total of 1734 unique citations were identified. Screening of these citations revealed 172 relevant studies, from which 87 studies presented primary data related to vectors. The orthobunyaviruses included Cache Valley virus (CVV), Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), Snowshoe Hare virus (SHV), and La Crosse virus (LACV). Surveillance was the predominant study focus, with most citations representing the United States, specifically, LACV surveillance in Tennessee, followed by CVV and JCV in Connecticut. Orthobunyaviruses were detected in many mosquito species across multiple genera, with high vector specificity only being reported for LACV, which included Aedes triseriatus, Aedes albopictus, and Aedes japonicus. Peridomestic areas were positively associated with infected mosquitoes compared with dense forests. Orthobunyavirus infections, coinfections, and gut microbiota affected mosquito feeding and breeding behavior.Conclusion: Knowledge gaps included Canadian surveillance data, disease modeling, and risk projections.

Their extensive migratory patterns expose them to multiple national and international fisheries and fishery management regimes. Several prized species have become the focus of global conservation efforts and there is a growing worldwide interest in establishing optimal strategies for sustainable tuna fisheries. Although this task has proven to be very challenging, it has taken on a new sense of urgency in the face of the potential effects of global climate change. A better understanding of the interactions between environmental conditions and tuna physiology and how they affect tuna behavior will offer population and stock assessment modelers and fisheries biologists a more mechanistic understanding of tuna distribution patterns and may help predict changes in both geographic and depth-related movement patterns. Indeed, physiological data comprise a growing component of multi-trait analysis approaches to species conservation. Our review aims to summarize what is known about differences among tuna species in distribution patterns, tolerances to environmental conditions, and physiological characteristics that correlate with the capacity to inhabit cooler (deeper, higher latitude) and even hypoxic waters. To achieve this goal, we discuss how these physiological traits are associated with habitat partitioning within the three-dimensional oceanic environment and with niche expansion into cooler and hypoxic waters.

This review provides an overview of factors contributing to these declines, as well as strategies and resources available to a diversity of stakeholders to help conserve grassland bird communities with an emphasis on the Great Plains-a grassland region of global ecological significance and a habitat stronghold for grassland birds. Grassland bird declines are driven by historical and continuing threats across the full annual cycle including grassland habitat loss, agriculture intensification, woody encroachment, and disruption of fire and grazing regimes. More recently, energy development activities, the use of neonicotinoid pesticides, and anthropogenic climate change have emerged as additional threats. While threats to grassland birds are numerous and often synergistic, possibilities for conservation are also diverse and multifaceted. Land set-aside programs, incentives and voluntary practices for producers, improved environmental management by energy and utility companies, and policy and regulation can all contribute to the conservation of these unique species. We suggest that future grassland bird research should focus on poorly studied aspects of the annual cycle, such as overwinter survival and habitat use, and the migratory period, which remains completely unexplored for many species. Filling these knowledge gaps may facilitate more sophisticated population modeling that can identify limiting factors and more effectively guide investment in conservation. (c) 2023 The Authors.

The Report will guide future domestic mechanisms to protect immigrants fleeing climate change under Executive Order (EO) 14013. The Biden Administration, through its EO 14013 in January 2021, had directed the National Security Advisor to prepare a report on the intersection of climate change and migration. The Report was released in October 2021 and consisted of cross-cutting themes that can guide future action plans built on principles of justice and equity, gender equality, and inclusion of marginalized communities. There is compelling evidence that disparate treatment exists in the United States on the basis of nationality, origin, race, and so on against migrants fleeing environmental disasters and climate change in their countries of origin. For example, historically, the United States has protected people disproportionately affected by disasters and ecological crises under domestic laws such as the Azorean Refugees Act 1958. However, the Azorean Refugees Act only covered the Europeans, and ever since, no domestic law has not been extended to protect people fleeing environmental disasters from non-European countries. Today, U.S. domestic laws fail to protect people of all nationalities fleeing environmental difficulties.

Variation in advancement among species has been proposed to correlate with geography and life history features, but individual studies have reported variable results, and general patterns have been elusive. In a quantitative review of data from 389 bird species sampled at 69 European and 23 North American localities, we evaluated associations between change in the timing of migration and life history (body size, molt, broodedness), ecology (habitat, diet, nest position), and geography. We confirmed that spring migration advanced: -0.214 d yr(-1) (95% CI: -0.266, -0.162) for first-arriving individuals and -0.104 d yr(-1) (-0.139, -0.071) for the median date of passage. The rate of change in autumn was more variable: 0.090 d yr(-1) (0.002, 0.176) delay for median passage and 0.019 d yr(-1) (-0.175, 0.204) delay for the date of last departure. The response during spring was weaker in the far north and in species that migrate long distances to the wintering area. Autumn migration became increasingly delayed in species that are large-bodied, molt before departure, and that feed on seeds, insects, or fruits. Variation among species, especially during autumn, was associated in part with constraints surrounding the timing of the postnuptial molt. The results suggest that ecological and life history features of species may influence their ability to respond to climate change.",2014,"SEP","Climate Research","61","2","109-121","WOS:000343963700002","10.3354/cr01238","","#1227","Bitterlin 2014","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

G.","Alder trees (Alnus spp.) are key nitrogen-fixing riparian species in the northern hemisphere. Inputs of nitrogen-rich leaf litter from alder into stream food webs can contribute significantly to nitrogen dynamics at local and landscape scales. Alder trees also provide habitats for terrestrial and aquatic organisms, and help stabilize river banks. Recently, substantial declines in alder stands have occurred along streams in Europe, with damages observed in some parts of North America also. A major driver has been the invasive oomycete pathogen Phytophthora alni species complex, which can spread rapidly along stream networks. This review synthesises information on the pathogen, processes of spread and infection, and its impacts on alder. We further address the potential ecosystem-level and management consequences of the decline of alder, and highlight research needs. The alder dieback caused by P. alni is associated with reductions in shade and quality and quantity of leaf litter. A decline in the structural integrity of branches and roots further threatens bank stability. Stream banks dominated by other tree species or no trees at all will result in ecosystem-level changes both above and below the waterline. The P. alni taxonomic complex includes different species with varying phenotypes. An improved understanding of their environmental tolerances, virulence and evolution, along with the processes regulating the spread and impacts of the pathogen, would assist in identification of the riparian and stream systems most vulnerable not only to invasion but also to the heaviest disease outbreaks and ecosystem-level impacts. Within the P. alni complex, the highly pathogenic hybrid species P. x alni is favoured by mild winters and warm, but not excessively hot summer temperatures suggesting possible changes in distribution and level of impact under future global climate change.",2016,"MAY","Freshwater Biology","61","5","565-579","WOS:000373833400001","10.1111/fwb.12729","","#1231","Bjelke 2016","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"45","Importance of climate change for the ranges, communities and conservation of birds","Böhning-Gaese, K.; Lemoine, N.; Moller, A. P.; Fielder, W.; Berthold, P.","In this review, we focus on the effects of global climate change on the size and position of geographic ranges and the richness and composition of bird communities. Plenty of evidence exists demonstrating that range boundaries of birds are correlated with climatic factors. In general, the northern range limit of species seems to be influenced rather by abiotic factors such as cold temperatures. The southern range limit of species appears to be determined by climatic factors such as heat or lack of water in and regions and by biotic factors in more humid regions. For communities, species richness is best predicted by measures of ambient temperature at high latitudes and by water-related variables in low-latitude, high-temperature regions. Models predicting range changes under climate change show idiosyncratic responses of different species with range contractions being more frequent than range expansions. Range shifts have been observed in temperate regions with northward shifts of northern range boundaries and no consistent trend of southern range boundaries. Further, upslope movements have been observed on a tropical mountain. For communities, increases in species richness are predicted for northern latitude and high-elevation sites and declines of species richness in and regions. With increasing winter temperature, declines in the proportion of migratory species in bird communities have been predicted and observed. Conservation consequences of global climate change are especially high threats to species in and environments, expected movements of species out of protected areas and increasing land use conflicts. In general, surprisingly few studies document effects of climate change on birds' ranges and communities. Given that range contractions and declines of species richness often initiate conservation efforts, further studies are urgently needed.",2004,"","BIRDS AND CLIMATE CHANGE","35","","211-236","WOS:000225964300010","10.1016/S0065-2504(04)35010-5","","#1315","Böhning-Gaese 2004","Meagan Oldfather (2024-10-05 07:25:39)(Select): No transboundary range shifts discussed;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

However, little is known on how inland SAV quantities are changing globally in response to human activities, where loss threatens the provisioning of these ecosystem services. In this study, we generate a comprehensive global synthesis of trends in SAV quantities using time series (> 10 years) in lakes and identify their main drivers. We compiled trends across methods and metrics, integrating both observational and paleolimnological approaches as well as diverse measures of SAV quantities, including areal extent, density, or abundance classes. The compilation revealed that knowledge on SAV is mostly derived from temperate regions, with major gaps in tropical, boreal, and mountainous lake-rich regions. Similar to other wetland types, we found that 41% of SAV times series are largely decreasing mostly due to land use change and resulting eutrophication. SAV is, however, increasing in 28% of cases, primarily since the 1980s. We show that trends and drivers of SAV quantities vary regionally, with increases in Europe explained mainly by management, decreases in Asia due to eutrophication and land use change, and variable trends in North America consistent with invasive species arrival. By providing a quantitative portrait of trends in SAV quantities worldwide, we identify knowledge gaps and future SAV research priorities. By considering the drivers of different trends, we also offer insight to future lake management related to climate, positive restoration actions, and change in community structure on SAV quantities.",2023,"MAY","Global Change Biology","29","9","2493-2509","WOS:000933182700001","10.1111/gcb.16619","","#1395","Botrel 2023","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The synthesis shows that multiple definitions of adaptation were used across studies, resulting in a conceptual murkiness that is a barrier to generalizing the findings to inform planned adaptation policies and projects. By using a seven-category typology to classify and compare smallholder farmer adaptations across communities, the synthesis shows that in order to reduce their vulnerability smallholder farmers have mostly taken action on environmental management and diversified their livelihoods through market exchange. Some have engaged in labour migration. Very few have pursued communal pooling, storage, or mobility as risk-reducing strategies. Despite the increasing recognition that adaptation is driven by multiple stressors, less than half of the adaptation studies included discussions of multiple stressors.

Q.","Analysis of in situ and satellite data shows evidence of different regional snow cover responses to the widespread warming and increasing winter precipitation that has characterized the Arctic climate for the past 40-50 years. The largest and most rapid decreases in snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow cover duration (SCD) are observed over maritime regions of the Arctic with the highest precipitation amounts. There is also evidence of marked differences in the response of snow cover between the North American and Eurasian sectors of the Arctic, with the North American sector exhibiting decreases in snow cover and snow depth over the entire period of available in situ observations from around 1950, while widespread decreases in snow cover are not apparent over Eurasia until after around 1980. However, snow depths are increasing in many regions of Eurasia. Warming and more frequent winter thaws are contributing to changes in snow pack structure with important implications for land use and provision of ecosystem services. Projected changes in snow cover from Global Climate Models for the 2050 period indicate increases in maximum SWE of up to 15% over much of the Arctic, with the largest increases (15-30%) over the Siberian sector.

K.; Mukherji, A.","Due to its potential geo-political and environmental implications, climate migration is an increasing concern to the international community. However, while there is considerable attention devoted to migration in response to sea-level rise, there is a limited understanding of human mobility due to freshwater and inland hydroclimatic changes. Hence, the aim of this paper is to examine the existing evidence on migration as an adaptation strategy due to freshwater and inland hydroclimatic changes. A meta-review of papers published between 2014 and 2019 yielded 67 publications, the majority of which focus on a handful of countries in the Global South. Droughts, floods, extreme heat, and changes in seasonal precipitation patterns were singled out as the most common hazards triggering migration. Importantly, most of the papers discuss mobility as part of a portfolio of responses. Motivations to migrate at the household level range from survival to searching for better economic opportunities. The outcomes of migration are mixed - spanning from higher incomes to difficulties in finding employment after moving and struggles with a higher cost of living. While remittances can be beneficial, migration does not always have a positive outcome for those who are left behind. Furthermore, this meta-review shows that migration, even when desired, is not an option for some of the most vulnerable households. These multifaceted results suggest that, while climate mobility is certainly happening due to freshwater and inland hydroclimatic changes, studies reviewing it are limited and substantial gaps remain in terms of geographical coverage, implementation assessments, and outcomes evaluation. We argue that these gaps need to be filled to inform climate and migration policies that increasingly need to be intertwined rather than shaped in isolation from each other.",2023,"AUG","Climatic Change","176","8","","WOS:001029146100001","10.1007/s10584-023-03573-6","","#1844","Caretta 2023","","Human movement",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

Reviewed here, as a window into global patterns, are the introduced, cryptogenic, and range expanding barnacles of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North and South America. Five species of thoracic barnacles have invaded the Pacific coasts of the Americas: Amphibalanus improvisus, A. eburneus, and A. subalbidus, all from the Atlantic, and A. amphitrite and A. reticulatus from the Indo-West Pacific. Seven species have invaded the Atlantic coasts of the Americas; six of these are from the Pacific: A. amphitrite and A. reticulatus (shared as invaders with the Pacific coast), and Balanus trigonus, B. glandula, Striatobalanus amaryllis, and Megabalanus coccopoma. The Western North Atlantic A. subalbidus has invaded the Western South Atlantic. Striking are the few barnacle invasions that have occurred on the Pacific coast of South America and these species (A. improvisus, A. amphitrite and A. reticulatus) are reported only from northernmost locations (Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru). For the first 100 years (1853-1955) two species, A. amphitrite and A. improvisus, constituted the majority of invasion events in the Americas, the sole exception being the arrival of the Pacific Balanus trigonus in the 1860s and 1870s in the Atlantic. After 1955, the first records of invasions of A. reticulatus, A. eburneus, B. glandula, M. coccopoma, and S. amaryllis appear, an increased diversity of introductions in close concert with general observations of increasing invasions globally of marine organisms after World War II. Known since the 1970s in Brazil, M. coccopoma appears to be responding to warming northern latitudes and has expanded to North Carolina as of 2005. The native Western Atlantic barnacle Chthamalus fragilis arrived in New England in the 1890s, a range expansion perhaps facilitated by an earlier coastal warming period concomitant with the decline in abundance of its colder-water competitor Semibalanus balanoides, although the latter also appears to have expanded south on the North American Atlantic coast in the twentieth century due to increased habitat availability. Chthamalus is predicted to move north, and Semibalanus is predicted to return to its historical range, both due to continued warming. In turn, the native Eastern North Pacific barnacle Tetraclita rubescens is expanding north due to coastal warming as well. Future invasion scenarios include increased introductions facilitated through a newly expanded Panama Canal, the potential arrival of Austrominius modestus on the North American Atlantic coast (despite its failure to do so throughout the last half of the twentieth century), and the arrival on the warmer North and Central American Pacific coasts of Chthamalus proteus.",2011,"","IN THE WRONG PLACE - ALIEN MARINE CRUSTACEANS: DISTRIBUTION, BIOLOGY AND IMPACTS","6","","159-213","WOS:000293984800005","10.1007/978-94-007-0591-3_510.1007/978-94-007-0591-3","","#1852","Carlton 2011","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

F.","Expansion of the global protected-area network has been proposed as a strategy to address threats from accelerating climate change and species extinction. A key step in increasing the effectiveness of such expansion is understanding how novel threats to biodiversity from climate change alter concepts such as rewilding, which have underpinned many proposals for large interconnected reserves. We reviewed potential challenges that climate change poses to rewilding and found that the conservation value of large protected areas persists under climate change. Nevertheless, more attention should be given to protection of microrefugia, macrorefugia, complete environmental gradients, and areas that connect current and future suitable climates and to maintaining ecosystem processes and stabilizing feedbacks via conservation strategies that are resilient to uncertainty regarding climate trends. Because a major element of the threat from climate change stems from its novel geographic patterns, we examined, as an example, the implications for climate-adaptation planning of latitudinal, longitudinal (continental to maritime), and elevational gradients in climate-change exposure across the Yellowstone-to-Yukon region, the locus of an iconic conservation proposal initially designed to conserve wide-ranging carnivore species. In addition to a continued emphasis on conserving intact landscapes, restoration of degraded low-elevation areas within the region is needed to capture sites important for landscape-level climate resilience. Extreme climate exposure projected for boreal North America suggests the need for ambitious goals for expansion of the protected-area network there to include refugia created by topography and ecological features, such as peatlands, whose conservation can also reduce emissions from carbon stored in soil. Qualitative understanding of underlying reserve design rules and the geography of climate-change exposure can strengthen the outcomes of inclusive regional planning processes that identify specific sites for protection.",2021,"FEB","Conservation Biology","35","1","155-167","WOS:000536718800001","10.1111/cobi.13531","","#1882","Carroll 2021","","Biotic; Intervention; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"57","Future Evolution of Greenland's Marine-Terminating Outlet Glaciers","Catania, G. A.; Stearns, L. A.; Moon, T. A.; Enderlin, E. M.; Jackson, R. H.","Mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) has increased over the last two decades in response to changes in global climate, motivating the scientific community to question how the GrIS will contribute to sea-level rise on timescales that are relevant to coastal communities. Observations also indicate that the impact of a melting GrIS extends beyond sea-level rise, including changes to ocean properties and circulation, nutrient and sediment cycling, and ecosystem function. Unfortunately, despite the rapid growth of interest in GrIS mass loss and its impacts, we still lack the ability to confidently predict the rate of future mass loss and the full impacts of this mass loss on the globe. Uncertainty in GrIS mass loss projections in part stems from the nonlinear response of the ice sheet to climate forcing, with many processes at play that influence how mass is lost. This is particularly true for outlet glaciers in Greenland that terminate in the ocean because their flow is strongly controlled by multiple processes that alter their boundary conditions at the ice-atmosphere, ice-ocean, and ice-bed interfaces. Many of these processes change on a range of overlapping timescales and are challenging to observe, making them difficult to understand and thus missing in prognostic ice sheet/climate models. For example, recent (beginning in the late 1990s) mass loss via outlet glaciers has been attributed primarily to changing ice-ocean interactions, driven by both oceanic and atmospheric warming, but the exact mechanisms controlling the onset of glacier retreat and the processes that regulate the amount of retreat remain uncertain. Here we review the progress in understanding GrIS outlet glacier sensitivity to climate change, how mass loss has changed over time, and how our understanding has evolved as observational capacity expanded. Although many processes are far better understood than they were even a decade ago, fundamental gaps in our understanding of certain processes remain. These gaps impede our ability to understand past changes in dynamics and to make more accurate mass loss projections under future climate change. As such, there is a pressing need for (1) improved, long-term observations at the ice-ocean and ice-bed boundaries, (2) more observationally constrained numerical ice flow models that are coupled to atmosphere and ocean models, and (3) continued development of a collaborative and interdisciplinary scientific community. Plain Language Summary Increasing mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) in response to changes in global climate has motivated the scientific community to understand how much sea level rise will happen in the coming decades. Observations now indicate that the impact of a melting GrIS are more widespread than just sea-level rise and include changes to ocean properties and circulation, nutrient and sediment cycling, and ecosystem function. Major uncertainties still hamper accurate predictions of these impacts, particularly for outlet glaciers in Greenland that terminate in the ocean because their flow is strongly controlled by multiple processes that alter their boundary conditions at the ice-atmosphere, ice-ocean, and ice-bed interfaces. Many of these processes change on a range of overlapping timescales and are challenging to observe. Here we review the scientific progress in understanding how GrIS outlet glaciers respond to climate and how our understanding has changed over time as observations have increased. We conclude with recommendations for (1) improved, long-term observations at the ice- ocean and ice-bed boundaries, (2) more observationally-constrained ice flow models that are linked to atmosphere and ocean models, and (3) continued development of a collaborative and interdisciplinary scientific community.",2020,"FEB","JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE","125","2","","WOS:000519719500008","10.1029/2018JF004873","","#1932","Catania 2020","","Biophysical",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

A.; GilPelegrin, E.; PegueroPina, J. J.; SanchoKnapik, D.","Climate is known to be a critical factor controlling the broad-scale distribution of plants but often the physiological basis for species distribution limits is not well understood, nor is the extent to which populations within species are locally adapted to climate. Reciprocal transplant experiments designed to test for local adaptation are difficult to conduct and interpret in long-lived species, like oaks. Linking the physiological tolerances of species to their climatic distributions is an alternative approach to understanding adaptation to climate, and is important in predicting future distributions of species under changing climatic conditions. Here we synthesize a series of studies in a single lineage of American oaks that span the temperate tropical divide and encompass a range of precipitation and edaphic regimes, to determine (1) the physiological basis for adaptation to seasonal winter and seasonal drought and (2) the variation among populations that associated with climate variation and can be interpreted as local adaptation. We focus primarily on a series of common gardens that allow us to determine the genetically based differences in functional and physiological traits as well as the genetically based responses to contrasting temperature or precipitation regimes. We show that variation in freezing tolerance among closely related species is greater than variation among populations within species. Nevertheless, freezing tolerance varies predictably with climate of origin and is negatively associated with growth rate. In contrast, drought tolerance mechanisms vary more among populations within a single species, at least for the most widely distributed species, Quercus oleoides, than between species. Within this species, climate of origin predicts a suite of leaf physiological traits, and there is evidence for evolutionary trade-off between desiccation avoidance and desiccation resistance. Combined, these results show evidence for local adaptation to both freezing and drought stress within species, as well as adaptive differentiation between closely related species, despite phylogenetic conservatism in functional traits and highly similar physiognomy across the American live oak clade. The results inform conservation efforts aimed at preventing extinction of tree species in the face of global change.",2017,"","OAKS PHYSIOLOGICAL ECOLOGY.

(wild lettuce) is a highly invasive C-3 weed in many countries, including Australia, Canada, and the USA. This weed is a severe threat to agricultural systems, especially in crops grown with reduced or no-tillage approaches, which commonly include wheat, cereals and pulses. Owing to the vertical orientation of its leaves in the north-south plane and its root architecture, L. serriola can maintain high water use efficiency under drought conditions, giving it the ability to expand its range under a drying climate. Each plant can produce up to 100,000 seeds which have no primary dormancy and form a short-term seedbank lasting up to three years. Most seedlings emerge in autumn and overwinter as a rosette, with a small flush of emergence in spring depicting staggered germination. Research into control methods for this weed has been performed, and these methods include chemical herbicides applied alone and in combination, the establishment of plant competition, tillage, mowing and bioherbicide. Herbicides can provide effective control when applied in the seedling or rosette stage; however, spring germination is difficult to control, as it skips the rosette stage. Some biotypes are now resistant to ALS inhibitor and synthetic auxins, causing concern regarding using herbicides. A dedicated integrated management plan for 3-4 years is recommended for the control of this troublesome species. This review will explore the biology, ecology, distribution, current control techniques and previous research on this weed, allowing us to make recommendations for its future research and management.",2021,"OCT","PLANTS-BASEL","10","10","","WOS:000714649700001","10.3390/plants10102157","","#1972","Chadha 2021","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The """"luxury effect"""" posits a positive association between biodiversity and socioeconomic status in urban areas, and is thus reflective of environmental injustice, as the benefits associated with biodiversity are not equitably shared across society. We aimed to determine the generality of the luxury effect, and to identify the factors causing its variation across published studies. Location Urbanized landscapes globally. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Terrestrial animals and plants. Methods We tested the luxury effect across a sample of 337 estimates of the relationship between biodiversity measures and socioeconomic status from 96 studies via a meta-analysis, addressing three hypotheses: (a) the luxury effect is more pronounced where water availability is limited, (b) the luxury effect is more pronounced in developing than developed countries, (c) the luxury effect is stronger in exotic compared to native species. Results There was a significant overall luxury effect: there was a positive association between terrestrial biodiversity measures and socioeconomic status. The strength of the luxury effect was greater in arid areas. There was limited support for a stronger luxury effect in exotic species, but no support for any association with development status. Main conclusions Many key and emerging climate impacts are concentrated in urban areas. Therefore, the degree of environmental injustice represented by the luxury effect may be amplified in the future, especially in arid regions. The objective to increase urban biodiversity through more equitable management and provision of water resources could form part of a wider strategy for sustainable development of cities to promote environmental justice, enhancing the quality of life of urban residents across all sectors of society.

E.; Roulet, N.; Eugster, W.; Kasischke, E.; Rastetter, E. B.; Zimov, S. A.; Running, S. W.","Synthesis of results from several Arctic and boreal research programmes provides evidence for the strong role of high-latitude ecosystems in the climate system. Average surface air temperature has increased 0.3 degreesC per decade during the twentieth century in the western North American Arctic and boreal forest zones. Precipitation has also increased, but changes in soil moisture are uncertain. Disturbance rates have increased in the boreal forest; for example, there has been a doubling of the area burned in North America in the past 20 years. The disturbance regime in tundra may not have changed. Tundra has a 3-6-fold higher winter albedo than boreal forest, but summer albedo and energy partitioning differ more strongly among ecosystems within either tundra or boreal forest than between these two biomes. This indicates a need to improve our understanding of vegetation dynamics within, as well as between, biomes. If regional surface warming were to continue, changes in albedo and energy absorption would likely act as a positive feedback to regional warming due to earlier melting of snow and, over the long term, the northward movement of treeline. Surface drying and a change in dominance from mosses to vascular plants would also enhance sensible heat flux and regional warming in tundra. In the boreal forest of western North America, deciduous forests have twice the albedo of conifer forests in both winter and summer, 50-80% higher evapotranspiration, and therefore only 30-50% of the sensible heat flux of conifers in summer. Therefore, a warming-induced increase in fire frequency that increased the proportion of deciduous forests in the landscape, would act as a negative feedback to regional warming. Changes in thermokarst and the aerial extent of wetlands, lakes, and ponds would alter high-latitude methane flux. There is currently a wide discrepancy among estimates of the size and direction of CO2 flux between high-latitude ecosystems and the atmosphere. These discrepancies relate more strongly to the approach and assumptions for extrapolation than to inconsistencies in the underlying data. Inverse modelling from atmospheric CO2 concentrations suggests that high latitudes are neutral or net sinks for atmospheric CO2, whereas field measurements suggest that high latitudes are neutral or a net CO2 source. Both approaches rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify. The most parsimonious explanation of the available data is that drying in tundra and disturbance in boreal forest enhance CO2 efflux. Nevertheless, many areas of both tundra and boreal forests remain net sinks due to regional variation in climate and local variation in topographically determined soil moisture. Improved understanding of the role of high-latitude ecosystems in the climate system requires a concerted research effort that focuses on geographical variation in the processes controlling land-atmosphere exchange, species composition, and ecosystem structure.

A consequence of global warming and the resultant climate change is the rise in cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyano-HABs) across the world, which pose a threat to public health, aquatic biodiversity, and the livelihood of communities that depend on these water systems, such as farmers and fishers. An increase in cyano-HABs and their intensity is associated with an increase in the leakage of cyanotoxins. Microcystins (MCs) are hepatotoxins produced by some cyanobacterial species, and their organ toxicology has been extensively studied. Recent mouse studies suggest that MCs can induce gut resistome changes. Opportunistic pathogens such as Vibrios are abundantly found in the same habitat as phytoplankton, such as cyanobacteria. Further, MCs can complicate human disorders such as heat stress, cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Firstly, this review describes how climate change mediates the rise in cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms in freshwater, causing increased levels of MCs. In the later sections, we aim to untangle the ways in which MCs can impact various public health concerns, either solely or in combination with other factors resulting from climate change.

For species of wildlife health concern, presence data are often lacking or outdated, thus limiting our ability to assess range changes and subsequent host impacts. We reconstructed the past and present distribution of the winter tick, Dermacentor albipictus, through the compilation of a spatiotemporal database to create the first full baseline map of its occurrence throughout its North American range. The ongoing impacts of winter tick epizootics in moose (Alces alces) and recent mortality events in elk (Cervus canadensis) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have led to a resurgence in interest in the future of this parasite in a warming climate. Over 3400 unique records of winter tick occurrence were compiled from multiple data sources, dating from 1869 to 2020 and spanning from 16.5 to 66.2 degrees N latitude. Both conventional published sources and natural history records were included along with new records from previously unpublished datasets and citizen science observations, to make this a comprehensive occurrence dataset for this species. Along with standardized location information and year of observation, the dataset includes associated host species and descriptive categorization of the type and source of each record, providing new opportunities to examine host-parasite interactions in the winter tick system over time and space. In presenting these data, we discuss the potential sampling biases and lacunas in our integrated database records, particularly at the winter tick's northernmost range. We also document changes in the types and sources of winter tick information from past to present, highlighting potential issues that should be considered before using these data in further analyses and when collecting ongoing records.

These areas confront multiple urgent climate challenges. Adaptation strategies encompass out-migration, community relocation, and enhancing resilience, yet research in this critical area is notably limited, particularly for the most vulnerable communities. This paper presents a comprehensive review of environmental stressors and contextual factors influencing migration decisions in the North American Arctic. While migration is primarily driven by job opportunities, education, healthcare, cultural, and infrastructural factors, factors such as family, culture, safety, subsistence life, and community ties strongly influence residents to stay. The study reveals a lack of clear evidence for climate-driven migration at the individual/household level, but it underscores well-documented community-level relocations. Two major challenges in studying Arctic climate migration are identified: the complexity of migration and the uniqueness of Arctic climate change. Recommendations include considering migration typology, disentangling climate drivers from contextual factors, and addressing data limitations through systematic collection, integration, and creative use of traditional and nontraditional data. The paper underscores the importance of establishing partnerships with local communities to achieve a holistic understanding of factors driving migration or immobility, ensuring research outcomes are connected to addressing community challenges.

Several international agencies have already highlighted the extent of disaster-induced migration and called for interventions. Though these agencies present a broad perspective, either at international, national, or regional level, the status of existing empirical studies on migration induced by specific disaster events is somewhat unknown. Hence, this paper reviews the existing empirical literature on disaster-induced migration with a special emphasis on the spatio-temporal variability in migration types and patterns in response to both slow onset and rapid onset disasters. Using the Web of Science database, PRISMA framework is followed to select 43 research articles to conduct bibliometric analysis and systematic review. The review findings demonstrate a prevalence of studies on migration due to rapid onset disasters like flood, landslides and earthquakes compared to slow onset disasters like droughts. Also, migration from rural areas to urban areas are found to be the most common spatial pattern of migration irrespective of the type of disaster. The existing studies are found to concentrate on the economic drivers that induced disaster-induced migration with very less or no focus on other social or political drivers or an interplay of drivers that may lead to migration.

A review of the recruitment biology of winter annual weeds in Canada. Can. J. Plant Sci. 89: 575-589. Typically, Summer annual weeds have been the primary management target for field crop farmers in Canada, but with changes in cropping systems and with acknowledged global climate change there will be an increasing need to consider the management of species that are present very early in the spring, including winter annual weeds. Knowledge of weed recruitment biology and emergence patterns can be used to guide weed management practices. A review was conducted of the recruitment biology of winter annual weeds in Canada. The key finding was that all of the significant winter annual weeds in Canadian agriculture are facultative, with the majority of species emerging at two peak periods, April-May and September-October. For the weed species included in this review, the information available on recruitment and seed biology was far from comprehensive, and for some species there was very little published information, in particular on specific base temperatures for germination, documented field-based emergence periods and data that could be used to create simple predictive population dynamics models, including fecundity (x environment), seed longevity and overwintering probability. This is particularly true with respect to information in Canadian agricultural contexts. A number of questions result from this review, a key one being whether spring versus fall emergence creates significant differences in fundamental biological characteristics of winter annual weeds including seed dormancy status, microsite requirements, phenology, plant vigour and competitive ability. Given that none of the winter annuals in Canada are constitutive and given ongoing climate change, farmers in Canada should be careful not to encourage summer annuals to become winter annuals. Movement away from fall weed management, including tillage and repeated sowing of winter annual crops will encourage facultative winter annual behaviour. In addition, farmers should be wary of invasion by populations of persistent winter annuals including stinkweed, chickweed and American dragonhead.",2009,"MAY","Canadian Journal of Plant Science","89","3","575-589","WOS:000266473000020","10.4141/CJPS08131","","#2292","Cici 2009","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-13 09:56:49)(Select): canada-centric but includes some information on US - therefore considering this implicitly transboundary for some weeds;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Overall, the meta-analytic average effect on migration is small for both slow- and rapid-onset events; however, it is positive and significant. Accounting for the clustering of the literature, which highlights how specific common features of the collected studies influence the magnitude of the estimated effect, reveals a significant heterogeneity among the four clusters of papers.

E.","We synthesize insights from current understanding of drought impacts at stand-to-biogeographic scales, including management options, and we identify challenges to be addressed with new research. Large stand-level shifts underway in western forests already are showing the importance of interactions involving drought, insects, and fire. Diebacks, changes in composition and structure, and shifting range limits are widely observed. In the eastern US, the effects of increasing drought are becoming better understood at the level of individual trees, but this knowledge cannot yet be confidently translated to predictions of changing structure and diversity of forest stands. While eastern forests have not experienced the types of changes seen in western forests in recent decades, they too are vulnerable to drought and could experience significant changes with increased severity, frequency, or duration in drought. Throughout the continental United States, the combination of projected large climate-induced shifts in suitable habitat from modeling studies and limited potential for the rapid migration of tree populations suggests that changing tree and forest biogeography could substantially lag habitat shifts already underway. Forest management practices can partially ameliorate drought impacts through reductions in stand density, selection of drought-tolerant species and genotypes, artificial regeneration, and the development of multistructured stands. However, silvicultural treatments also could exacerbate drought impacts unless implemented with careful attention to site and stand characteristics. Gaps in our understanding should motivate new research on the effects of interactions involving climate and other species at the stand scale and how interactions and multiple responses are represented in models.

We review the state of the science and identify key research needs to understand the impacts of en route events around the GOM region on populations of intercontinental landbird migrants that breed in North America, including: (1) distribution, timing, and habitat associations; (2) habitat characteristics and quality; (3) migratory connectivity; and (4) threats to and current conservation status of airspace and stopover habitats. Finally, we also call for the development of unified and comprehensive long-term monitoring guidelines and international partnerships to advance our understanding of the role of habitats around the GOM in supporting migratory landbird populations moving between temperate breeding grounds and wintering grounds in Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean.",2017,"MAY","Condor","119","2","327-343","WOS:000402159700013","10.1650/CONDOR-17-20.1","","#2366","Cohen 2017","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-22 07:40:48)(Select): GOM is a transboundary space and migration of birds is important to biodiversity.

Following high-severity fire, forest recovery may be compromised by lack of tree seed sources, warmer and drier postfire climate, or short-interval reburning. A potential outcome of the loss of resilience is the conversion of the prefire forest to a different forest type or nonforest vegetation. Conversion implies major, extensive, and enduring changes in dominant species, life forms, or functions, with impacts on ecosystem services. In the present article, we synthesize a growing body of evidence of fire-driven conversion and our understanding of its causes across western North America.

Despite significant investigation into these factors, an integrated understanding of where and when they may be important is lacking. Here, we review evidence for the factors underlying the historical and contemporary distributions of North American tree species and argue that a cohesive conceptual framework must be informed by an understanding of species ecological and evolutionary history. We further demonstrate that available evidence offers little indication of a significant, independent influence of biotic interactions or dispersal limitation on species distributions. Disturbance may provide important constraints on distributions in limited contexts. Overall, historic and contemporary evidence suggests that species distributions are strongly influenced by climate, yet examples of disequilibrium with climate abound.

An innovative web crawler tool was employed to help critically synthesize the information in the literature. The literature suggests that climate change will impact nutrient dynamics around the globe and exacerbate contemporary water-quality challenges. Nutrient leaching and overland flow transport are projected to increase globally, promoted by extreme precipitation. Seasonal variations in stream flow are expected to emulate changing precipitation patterns, but the specific local impacts of climate change on hydrology and nutrient dynamics will vary both seasonally and regionally. Plant activity may reduce some of this load in nonagricultural soils if the expected increase in plant uptake of nutrients prompted by increased temperatures can compensate for greater nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) mineralization, N deposition, and leaching rates. High-temperature forest and grass fires may help reduce mineralization and microbial turnover by altering N speciation via the pyrolysis of organic matter. In agricultural areas that are at higher risk of erosion, extreme precipitation will exacerbate existing water-quality issues, and greater plant nutrient uptake may lead to an increase in fertilizer use. Future urban expansion will amplify these effects. Higher ambient temperatures will promote harmful cyanobacterial blooms by enhancing thermal stratification, increasing nutrient load into streams and lakes from extreme precipitation events, decreasing summer flow and thus baseflow dilution capacity, and increasing water and nutrient residence times during increasingly frequent droughts. Land management decisions must consider the nuanced regional and seasonal changes identified in this review (realized and predicted).

Intense livestock production, increased travel, and changing climate have increased the risk of catastrophic animal losses due to infectious diseases. In the event of an outbreak, it is essential to properly manage the infected animals to prevent the spread of diseases. The most common disposal methods used during a disease outbreak include burial, landfilling, incineration and composting. Biosecurity, transportation logistics, public perception, and environmental concerns limit the use of some of these methods. During a disease outbreak, the large number of mortalities often exceeds the capacity of local rendering plants and landfills. Transporting mortalities to disposal and incineration facilities outside the production operation introduces biosecurity risks. Burying mortalities is limited by the size and availability of suitable sites and it has the risk of pathogen survival and contamination of groundwater and soil. Portable incinerators are expensive and have the potential to aerosolize infectious particles. Composting, on the other hand, has been recognized as a biosecure disposal method. Research showed that it eliminates bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157: H7, Salmonella spp., as well as viruses including highly pathogenic avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, Newcastle disease, and porcine epidemic diarrhea. This paper summarizes the lessons learned during the major animal disease outbreaks including the 2010 foot-and-mouth disease, 2016 highly pathogenic avian influenza, and recent African swine fever outbreaks. The purpose of this review is to critically discuss the biosecurity of composting as a mortality disposal method during the outbreaks of infectious animal diseases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

H.; Gandhi, K. J. K.","Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) is one of the most important conifer species across eastern North America. However, emerging health issues of eastern white pine have increased dramatically in recent decades, raising serious concerns over the health and future of this species. These emerging issues are due to native pests and pathogens that were mostly innocuous in the past and hence, have been rarely studied. One fungal pathogen of concern, Caliciopsis pinea Peck, is associated with severe resinosis, crown thinning, dieback, cankers, and bark cracks/fissures. Reports of C. pinea have been on the rise since the mid-1990s, particularly in the northeastern U.S. An insect of concern, eastern white pine bast scale (Matsucoccus macrocicatrices Richards), is a sap-sucking pest associated with branch flagging, dieback, and canker formation. Although described as early as 1958, this insect was not reported in the southeastern U.S. until 2006, when it was found on eastern white pine with dieback symptoms. A foliar complex of fungal pathogens has also been on the rise since 2006 in the northeastern U.S. and southern Canada, known collectively as White Pine Needle Damage. This complex results in needle discoloration and necrosis, premature needle drop, and branch dieback. In combination, these emerging health issues are occurring at levels not previously reported and across several regions, indicating an imminent range-wide health concern for eastern white pine. Our goal is to synthesize the ecology, evolutionary and post-settlement history, silvicultural practices, and abiotic and biotic stressors of eastern white pine. By unifying the known ecology and stressors of eastern white pine, we aim to provide a forest health framework to assist resource managers in developing a cohesive conservation, management, and restoration plan for this critical conifer species in North America.",2018,"SEP 1","Forest Ecology and Management","423","","3-17","WOS:000437046900002","10.1016/j.foreco.2018.02.049","","#2500","Costanza 2018","Meagan Oldfather (2024-10-04 07:43:13)(Select): Disease dynamics across entire transboundary range of eastern white pine; flow of disease ;","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

C.","The Great Plains landscape is less topographically complex than most other regions within North America, but diverse aquatic ecosystems, such as playas, pothole lakes, ox-bow lakes, springs, groundwater aquifers, intermittent and ephemeral streams, as well as large rivers and wetlands, are highly dynamic and responsive to extreme climatic fluctuations. We review the evidence for climatic change that demonstrates the historical importance of extremes in north-south differences in summer temperatures and east-west differences in aridity across four large subregions. These physical driving forces alter density stratification, deoxygenation, decomposition and salinity. Biotic community composition and associated ecosystem processes of productivity and nutrient cycling respond rapidly to these climatically driven dynamics. Ecosystem processes also respond to cultural effects such as dams and diversions of water for irrigation, waste dilution and urban demands for drinking water and industrial uses. Distinguishing climatic from cultural effects in future models of aquatic ecosystem functioning will require more refinement in both climatic and economic forecasting.

Water law has thus become one vehicle of climate change adaptation. Legal research into the intersections between climate change and water law in the United States must contend with the facts that: (a) climate change affects different parts of this large country differently; and (b) U.S. water law is itself a complicated subject, with each state having its own laws for surface water and groundwater and the federal government playing a significant role in interstate and international waters, in building and managing large water infrastructure, and in creating water rights for Native American tribes and other federal reservations. Within this complexity, legal research to date has tended to focus on the law governing surface water in the American West, enumerating various problems with the prior appropriation doctrine as the West grows hotter and drier and offering multiple suggestions to increase legal flexibility so that western water can be re-allocated to reflect changing social-ecological realities. These suggestions extend to new, more comprehensive, and more adaptive water governance approaches.

Biomes whose extents are limited by temperature or precipitation, such as the tundra and savanna, may be particularly strongly affected by climate change. While woody plant encroachment is prevalent across both biomes, its relationship to temperature and precipitation change remains unknown. Here, we quantify the degree to which woody encroachment is related to climate change and identify its main associated drivers. Location Tundra and savanna biomes. Time period 1992 +/- 20.27-2010 +/- 5.62 (mean +/- SD). 1876-2016 (range). Major taxa studied Woody plants (shrubs and trees). Methods We compiled a dataset comprising 1,089 records from 899 sites of woody plant cover over time and attributed drivers of woody cover change across these two biomes. We calculated cover change in each biome and assessed the degree to which cover change corresponds to concurrent temperature and precipitation changes using multiple climate metrics. Finally, we conducted a quantitative literature review of the relative importance of attributed drivers of woody cover change. Results Woody encroachment was widespread geographically and across climate gradients. Rates of woody cover change (positive or negative) were 1.8 times lower in the tundra than in the savanna (1.8 vs. 3.2%), while rates of woody cover increase (i.e., encroachment) were c. 1.7 times lower in the tundra compared with the savanna (3.7 vs. 6.3% per decade). In the tundra, magnitudes of woody cover change did not correspond to climate, while in the savanna, greater cover change corresponded with increases in precipitation. We found higher rates of woody cover change in wetter versus drier sites with warming in the tundra biome, and higher rates of woody cover change in drier versus wetter sites with increasing precipitation in the savanna. However, faster rates of woody cover change were not associated with more rapid rates of climate change across sites, except for maximum precipitation in the savanna. Main conclusions Woody encroachment was positively related to warming in the tundra and increased rainfall in the savanna. However, cover change rates were not predicted by rates of climate change, which can be partially explained by climate interactions in both biomes. Additional likely influences include site-level factors, time-lags, plant-specific responses, and land use and other non-climate drivers.

E.; Welty, J.; Mayer, K. E.","Fire regimes in sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems have been greatly altered across the western United States. Broad-scale invasion of non-native annual grasses, climate change, and human activities have accelerated wildfire cycles, increased fire size and severity, and lengthened fire seasons in many sagebrush ecosystems to the point that current wildfire-management practices and postfire restoration efforts cannot keep pace to ameliorate the ecological consequences of sagebrush ecosystem loss. The greatest impact of uncharacteristically frequent fire is the transition from native sagebrush-perennial grass communities to invasive, non-native, annual grasslands that are highly flammable. These community transitions are often permanent, owing to the low probability of reestablishing native perennial plants in non-native annual grass -dominated communities. Moreover, these grasses can form extensive and continuous fine fuel loads that promote more frequent fire and the continued expansion of invasive, non-native annuals. More frequent, larger, and severe wildfires necessitate greater resources for fire-prevention, fire-suppression, and postfire restoration activities, while decreasing critical ecosystem services, economic and recreational opportunities, and cultural traditions. Increased flexibility and better prioritization of management activities based on ecological needs, including commitment to long-term prefire and postfire management, are needed to achieve notable reductions in uncharacteristic wildfire activity and associated negative impacts. Collaboration and partnerships across jurisdictional boundaries, agencies, and disciplines can improve consistency in sagebrush-management approaches and thereby contribute to this effort. Here, we provide a synthesis on sagebrush wildfire trends and the impacts of uncharacteristic fire regimes on sage-brush plant communities, dependent wildlife species, fire-suppression costs, and ecosystem services. We also provide an overview of wildland fire coordination effort s among federal, state, and tribal entities.Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Society for Range Management.

Changes are already ongoing in Arctic systems, but there is a lack of coordinated monitoring of Arctic freshwaters that hinders our ability to assess changes in biodiversity. To address the need for coordinated monitoring on a circumpolar scale, the Arctic Council working group, Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna, established the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program, which is an adaptive monitoring program for the Arctic centred around four ecosystem themes (i.e., Freshwater, Terrestrial, Coastal, Marine). The freshwater theme developed a monitoring plan for Arctic freshwater biodiversity and recently completed the first assessment of status and trends in Arctic freshwater biodiversity. Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program-Freshwater has compiled and analysed a database of Arctic freshwater monitoring data to form the first report of the state of circumpolar Arctic freshwater biodiversity. This special issue presents the scientific analyses that underlie the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program-Freshwater report and provides analyses of spatial and temporal diversity patterns and the multiple-stressor scenarios that act on the biological assemblages and biogeochemistry of Arctic lakes and rivers.

Hematophagous arthropods can be vectors of infectious and potentially lethal pathogens and parasites, thus constituting a growing threat to humans-especially when associated with biological invasions. Today, several major vector-borne diseases, currently described as emerging or re-emerging, are expanding in a world dominated by climate change, land-use change and intensive transportation of humans and goods. In this review, we retrace the historical trajectory of these invasions to better understand their ecological, physiological and genetic drivers and their impacts on ecosystems and human health. We also discuss arthropod management strategies to mitigate future risks by harnessing ecology, public health, economics and social-ethnological considerations. Trade and transport of goods and materials, including vertebrate introductions and worn tires, have historically been important introduction pathways for the most prominent invasive hematophagous arthropods, but sources and pathways are likely to diversify with future globalization. Burgeoning urbanization, climate change and the urban heat island effect are likely to interact to favor invasive hematophagous arthropods and the diseases they can vector. To mitigate future invasions of hematophagous arthropods and novel disease outbreaks, stronger preventative monitoring and transboundary surveillance measures are urgently required. Proactive approaches, such as the use of monitoring and increased engagement in citizen science, would reduce epidemiological and ecological risks and could save millions of lives and billions of dollars spent on arthropod control and disease management.

T.","Many arid grasslands around the world are affected by woody plant encroachment and by the replacement of a relatively continuous grass cover with shrub patches bordered by bare soil. This shift in plant community composition is often abrupt in space and time, suggesting that it is likely sustained by positive feedbacks between vegetation and environmental conditions (e.g. resource availability) or disturbance regime (e.g. fire or freeze). These feedbacks amplify the effects of drivers of shrub encroachment, i.e. of conditions favouring a shift from grass to shrub dominance (e.g. overgrazing, climate change). Here, we review some major drivers and feedbacks and identify the basic stages in the transition from grassland to shrubland. We discuss some possible scenarios of interactions between drivers and feedbacks that could explain the transition from a stage to the next and the potential irreversibility of the shift from grass to shrub dominance.

Marine ectotherms such as fish experience elevated distribution shifts, as temperature plays a key role in physiological functions and delineating population ranges through thermal constraints. Distributional response predictions necessary for population management have been complicated by high heterogeneity in magnitude and direction of movements, which may be explained by both biological as well as methodological study differences. To date, however, there has been no comprehensive synthesis of the interacting ecological factors influencing fish distributions in response to climate change and the confounding methodological factors that can affect their estimation. In this study we analyzed published studies meeting criteria of reporting range shift responses to global warming in 115 taxa spanning all major oceanic regions, totaling 595 three-dimensional population responses (latitudinal, longitudinal, and depth), with temperature identified as a significant driver. We found that latitudinal shifts were the fastest in non-exploited, tropical populations, and inversely correlated with depth shifts which, in turn, dominated at the trailing edges of population ranges. While poleward responses increased with rate of temperature change and latitude, niche was a key factor in predicting both depth (18% of variation) and latitudinal responses (13%), with methodological predictors explaining between 10% and 28% of the observed variance in marine fish responses to temperature change.

Monitoring of these ecotones is important in light of the potential for change. Equally important is an understanding of past changes so that future changes and their impacts can be forecast. This paper provides an overview of methods that have been used to detect and measure change at forest-tundra ecotones worldwide, with examples drawn from studies of treelines in alpine areas of the subarctic. These methods include resurveys of field plots and transects, repeat photography, dendrochronology, use of historical records, remote sensing, and paleoecological techniques such as palynology and subfossil analysis. The benefits and limitations of each approach are identified and evaluated. It is shown that there is no single best method, largely because each is only capable of resolving change within a specific range of temporal and spatial extents. Multiscale approaches that integrate several methods and techniques provide a more comprehensive picture of change and can be used to identify the variables that influence treeline dynamics and better understand functional mechanisms of response.",2011,"SEP","Geography Compass","5","9","","WOS:000214325500001","10.1111/j.1749-8198.2011.00447.x","","#2697","Danby 2011","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-19 14:00:27)(Select): """"Thus, treelines are expected to advance as temperatures warm, and evidence of more advanced treeline positions during past warm periods supports this.""""

Here we present a meta-analysis of the impacts of climate fluctuation and Euro-Canadian settlement on burned areas from 1850 to 1990 in a large zone (>100 000 km(2)) in northern temperate and boreal forests of eastern Canada. Using Cox regression models, we tested for potential statistical relationships between historical burned areas in 12 large landscapes (reconstructed with dendrochronological data) with climate reconstructions, changes in the Euro-Canadian population, and active suppression (all reconstructed at the decadal scale). Our results revealed a dominant impact of climate fluctuations on forest burned areas, with the driest decades showing fire hazards between 5 to 15 times higher than the average decades. Comparatively, the Euro-Canadian settlement had a much weaker effect, having increased burned areas significantly only during less fire-prone climate conditions. During periods of fire-prone climate, burned areas were maximum independent of fluctuations in Euro-Canadian populations. Moreover, the development of active fire suppression did not appear to reduce burned areas. These results suggest that a potential increase in climate moisture deficit and drought may trigger unprecedented burned areas and extreme fire events no matter the effects of anthropogenic ignition or suppression.",2021,"NOV","Environmental Research Letters","16","11","","WOS:000709104000001","10.1088/1748-9326/ac2ce7","","#2708","Danneyrolles 2021","","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This study uses a recently developed geospatial database of ship traffic to provide the first synthesized overview of the spatial and temporal variability of different vessel types in Arctic Canada during the 26-year period from 1990 to 2015. This examination shows that, overall, the distance traveled by ships in Arctic Canada nearly tripled (from 364 179 km in 1990 to 918 266 km in 2015), that the largest proportion of ship traffic in the region is from general cargo vessels and government icebreakers (including research ships), and that the fastest growing vessel type by far is pleasure craft (private yachts).

S.","Persistence of natural populations during periods of climate change is likely to depend on migration (range shifts) or adaptation. These responses were traditionally considered discrete processes and conceptually divided into the realms of ecology and evolution. In a milestone paper, Davis and Shaw (2001) Science 292:673 argued that the interplay of adaptation and migration was central to biotic responses to Quaternary climate, but since then there has been no synthesis of efforts made to set up this research program. Here we review some of the salient findings from molecular genetic studies assessing ecological and evolutionary responses to Quaternary climate change. These studies have revolutionized our understanding of population processes associated with past species migration. However, knowledge remains limited about the role of natural selection for local adaptation of populations to Quaternary environmental fluctuations and associated range shifts, and for the footprints this might have left on extant populations. Next-generation sequencing technologies, high-resolution paleoclimate analyses, and advances in population genetic theory offer an unprecedented opportunity to test hypotheses about adaptation through time. Recent population genomics studies have greatly improved our understanding of the role of contemporary adaptation to local environments in shaping spatial patterns of genetic diversity across modern-day landscapes. Advances in this burgeoning field provide important conceptual and methodological bases to decipher the historical role of natural selection and assess adaptation to past environmental variation. We suggest that a process called """"temporal conditional neutrality"""" has taken place: some alleles favored in glacial environments become selectively neutral in modern-day conditions, whereas some alleles that had been neutral during glacial periods become under selection in modern environments.

A.","Arctic warming is occurring at amuch faster rate than in other parts of the globe, with potentially devastating consequences for the diverse array of species within ecologically and biologically sensitive areas in the Arctic marine region. However, climate change research in this region is sparse compared to other biomes, hindering conservation efforts. In this article, we review and synthesize the available literature to understand the observed and potential impacts of climate change on different species and ecosystems in the Arctic marine region. We reviewed 253 articles reporting changes in species and ecosystems in the Arctic marine region in response to climate change (225 studies documenting observed impacts and 28 reporting predicted impacts). The review revealed that most research effort has been concentrated in only a subset of Arctic Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) (5/18 LMEs), with the majority of Arctic LMEs being poorly studied. The majority of the reviewed papers focused on marine mammals (19%) followed by microalgae (17%). A number of studies documented variability in planktonic communities (microalgae, macroalgae, zooplankton), resulting in alteration in ecosystem structure and function. Reproductive failure, decline in populations, and changes in diet composition, behavior, and breeding biology were reported for sea birds and mammals. Further, shifts in spatial distribution of fishes were observed by several studies. This review provides persuasive evidence that multiple climate change indices in the Arctic region are changing, with impacts on almost all components of marine biotic ecosystems (from plankton to top predators). We identify a number of gaps (such as limited inventory of biota, robustness of data supporting climate change indices on an Arctic Ocean scale, and climate suitability assessment for all species) in climate change research in Arctic marine ecosystems where future studies can help to quantify the impacts of climate change on species and ecosystems and advance understanding for their adaptive management.",2023,"SEP","Environmental Reviews","31","3","403-451","WOS:000963001200001","10.1139/er-2022-0101","","#2881","Deb 2023","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-19 04:28:12)(Select): This definitely relates to biodiversity + climate change.

A.; Yousefpour, R.","Forest thinning can significantly affect hydrological processes. However, these effects largely vary with forest types, climate, thinning intensity, and hydrological variables of interest. Understanding these effects and their variations can significantly support thinning treatments' design and selection to ensure desired hydrological benefits. In this global-level review paper, we report the first comprehensive meta-analysis on the effects of thinning on major hydrological processes with an emphasis on rainfall partitioning, soil moisture and evapotranspiration processes. The synthesized and reviewed studies encompass different biophysical conditions (climate and forest ecosystems), silvicultural systems, and time scales (from weeks to decades) across continents. The results showed a significant increase in net precipitation, soil moisture and tree-level water use after thinning (the effect sizes are 1.19, 1.14 and 1.56 relative to the value of the control, respectively), while decreases in stemflow and transpiration (the effect sizes of 0.42 and 0.6 relative to the value of the control, respectively). Thinning intensity of about 50% of the stand density is determined as the threshold at or over which hydrological processes are significantly affected. The duration of thinning effect can be set between 2.6 and 4.3 (throughfall) and 3.1-8.6 years (soil moisture and transpiration), asking for repeated thinning in order to effectively sustain these effects. These global averages can serve as benchmarks for assessment and comparisons, but the effects of thinning depend on local biophysical conditions and thinning treatments. The literature review on the rest of the studied hydrological variables suggests that thinning generally enhance runoff to increase water yield and groundwater recharge. Thinning can also have a positive or limited role in water use efficiency (WUE), but it mitigates the effects of drought through increasing WUE. Moderate adverse effects on water quality can be prevented by adequate forest managements to prevent soil degradation. Nevertheless, more researches at relatively less studied regions are needed to support a more robust analysis of these reviewed hydrological variables. The management implications of the synthesized and reviewed results are suggested and discussed within the context of climate change.",2022,"SEP 1","Forest Ecology and Management","519","","","WOS:000821335600001","10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120324","","#2914","delCampo 2022","","Biophysical; Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Declines can occur simultaneously at both large and small regional scales rendering factors driving the decreases more elusive. On the south coast of Newfoundland abundance of Atlantic salmon at Conne River fell by 92% over a period of almost four decades in contrast with most other populations in the region suggesting local factors may be contributing to the decline. Here factors potentially contributing to the long-term decline of salmon are reviewed by (1) examining long-term trends in abundance and survival at different life stages, (2) presenting a synopsis on the presence and absence of factors impacting survival and productivity of this population, (3) using a semi-quantitative two dimensional classification system, based on expert opinion, to rank factors potentially contributing to the decline, and (4) utilizing a quantitative Random Forest analysis to complement the expert opinion approach in identifying factors possibly affecting salmon abundance in this south coast Newfoundland population. Results from both qualitative and quantitative analyses identified factors associated with salmon aquaculture as a possible driver of the decline. Additional factors include the influence of both climate change and predation in freshwater and marine habitats.

Besides increasing adaptation and mitigation efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, climate change remains a major challenge in the twenty-first century and beyond especially for tourism which is highly climate sensitive. Hence, it is necessary for tourism to adapt to survive. The aim of the study is to provide a systematic overview of the topic to offer a foundation for better understanding different ways of integrating climate finance initiatives with tourism. Design/methodology/approach - The research focused on the top-ranked, peer reviewed journals of each of the two selected research fields. To address this topic, an in-depth systematic literature review in the fields of climate change finance and tourism adaptation development was conducted. Furthermore, because it is a relatively new research topic, conference proceedings were also explored. To guarantee wide coverage of the literature, a query of the following scholarly databases was considered: Elsevier, ScienceDirect and Web of Science. Findings - Based on the analyses of the literature available on the topic, the paper highlights the main research trends and conclusions. It is argued that there is imbalance of knowledge on climate change finance as it relates to tourism. To date, there have been relatively few published articles on this topic in the context of tourism. Based on the findings, promising areas for future research were identified, and in particular for small island communities and recommendations for future research are outlined. Research limitations/implications - The paper is limited by the scope of the literature review accessed by the researcher. The results of this review may vary according to the databases used. Originality/value - Currently, there is no extensive review of articles on climate finance and tourism adaptation.

S.","Kelp forests worldwide are threatened by both climate change and localized anthropogenic impacts. Species with cold-temperate, subpolar, or polar distributions are projected to experience range contractions over the coming decades, which may be exacerbated by climatic events such as marine heatwaves and increased freshwater and sediment input from rapidly contracting glaciers. The northeast Pacific has an extensive history of harvesting and cultivating kelps for subsistence, commercial, and other uses, and, therefore, declines in kelp abundance and distributional shifts will have significant impacts on this region. Gaps in our understanding of how cold-temperate kelp species respond to climate stressors have limited our ability to forecast the status of kelp forests in future oceans, which hampers conservation and management efforts. Here, we conducted a structured literature review to provide a synthesis of the impacts of multiple climate-related stressors on kelp forests in the northeast Pacific, assess existing knowledge gaps, and suggest potential research priorities. We chose to focus on temperature, salinity, sediment load, and light as the stressors most likely to vary and impact kelps as climate change progresses. Our results revealed biases in the existing literature toward studies investigating the impacts of temperature, or temperature in combination with light. Other stressors, particularly salinity and sediment load, have received much less focus despite rapidly changing conditions in high-latitude regions. Furthermore, multiple stressor studies appear to focus on kelp sporophytes, and it is necessary that we improve our understanding of how kelp microstages will be affected by stressor combinations.

Numerous straits in the Indonesian Seas provide oceanic channels for planetary waves propagating between the tropical Pacific and the southeast Indian Ocean. On a large scale, the inter-basin mass transports and planetary waves change the ocean thermal structure, triggering strong air-sea interactions, and further regulating the variability of Walker and Hadley Circulations.

However, concerns have been raised about the threat that climate change poses to the functions of oceans. This study examines the impacts, threats, and adaptation strategies of climate change and marine biodiversity. Using bibliometric and secondary data analysis, this study determines that climate change leads to rising sea temperatures, marine heatwaves, acidification, and increasing sea levels. These factors undermine the significance of ocean ecosystem services. This study also identifies the significant risks posed by climate change to marine species diversity and distribution, primarily through habitat degradation and shifts in species ranges. Scholarly focus on these challenges has grown over time, focusing on adaptation strategies and building resilience to mitigate adverse impacts. This study critically evaluates various adaptation measures, including nature-based and human-based solutions such as habitat restoration, policy and legislative frameworks, and their potential to protect marine ecosystems. It provides detailed discussions on the effectiveness of adaptation strategies such as marine protected areas (MPAs), mangrove and coral reef restoration, and species range shifts. This review also emphasises the significance of indigenous knowledge systems and community participation in marine conservation efforts to achieve holistic and sustainable management.

B.","A consistent methodology for assessing the accumulating effects of natural and manmade change on riverine systems has not been developed for a whole host of reasons including a lack of data, disagreement over core elements to consider, and complexity. Accumulated state assessments of aquatic systems is an integral component of watershed cumulative effects assessment. The Yukon River is the largest free flowing river in the world and is the fourth largest drainage basin in North America, draining 855000km(2) in Canada and the United States. Because of its remote location, it is considered pristine but little is known about its cumulative state. This review identified 7 hot spot areas in the Yukon River Basin including Lake Laberge, Yukon River at Dawson City, the Charley and Yukon River confluence, Porcupine and Yukon River confluence, Yukon River at the Dalton Highway Bridge, Tolovana River near Tolovana, and Tanana River at Fairbanks. Climate change, natural stressors, and anthropogenic stresses have resulted in accumulating changes including measurable levels of contaminants in surface waters and fish tissues, fish and human disease, changes in surface hydrology, as well as shifts in biogeochemical loads. This article is the first integrated accumulated state assessment for the Yukon River basin based on a literature review. It is the first part of a 2-part series.

"103","Adapting North American agriculture to climate change in review","Easterling, W. E.","The adaptability of North American agriculture to climate change is assessed through a review of current literature. A baseline of North American agriculture without climate change suggests that farming faces serious challenges in the future (e.g. declining domestic demand, loss of comparative advantage, rising environmental costs). Climate change adjustments at the farm-level and in government policy, including international trade policy, are inventoried from the literature. The adaptive potential of agriculture is demonstrated historically with situations that are analogous to climate change, including the translocation of crops across natural climate gradients, the rapid introduction of new crops such as soybeans in the US and canola in Canada, and resource substitutions prompted by changes in prices of production inputs. A wide selection of modeling studies is reviewed which, in net, suggests several agronomic and economic adaptation strategies that are available to agriculture. Agronomic strategies include changes in crop varieties and species, timing of operations, and land management including irrigation. Economic strategies include investment in new technologies, infrastructure and labor, and shifts in international trade. Overall, such agronomic strategies were found to offset either partially or completely the loss of productivity caused by climate change. Economic adaptations were found to render the agricultural costs of climate change small by comparison with the overall expansion of agricultural production. New avenues of adaptive research are recommended including the formalization of the incorporation of adaptation strategies into modeling, linkage of adaptation to the terrestrial carbon cycle, anticipation of future technologies, attention to scaling from in situ modeling to the landscape scale, expansion of data sets and the measurement and modeling of unpriced costs. The final assessment is that climate change should not pose an insurmountable obstacle to North American agriculture. The portfolio of assets needed to adapt is large in terms of land, water, energy, genetic diversity, physical intrastructure and human resources, research capacity and information systems, and political institutions and world trade-the research reviewed here gives ample evidence of the ability of agriculture to utilize such assets. In conclusion, the apparent efficiency with which North American agriculture may adapt to climate changes provides little inducement for diverting agricultural adaptation resources to efforts to slow or halt the climate changes.",1996,"JUN","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","80","1","1-53","WOS:A1996UV51900002","10.1016/0168-1923(95)02315-1","","#3323","Easterling 1996","","Human movement; Original study; Potentially relevant",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE

They are enhanced by burning of fossil fuels and the emission of huge amounts of CO2 gas which resulted in greenhouse effect. It is expected that the average global temperature will increase with 2-5 degrees C in the next decades. As a result, the earth will exhibit marked climatic changes characterized by extremer weather events in the coming decades, such as the increase in temperature, rainfall, summertime, droughts, more frequent and stronger tornadoes and hurricanes. Epidemiological disease cycle includes host, pathogen and in certain cases intermediate host/vector. A complex mixture of various environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and humidity) determines the suitable habitat/ecological niche for every vector host. The availability of suitable vectors is a precondition for the emergence of vector-borne pathogens. Climate changes and global warming will have catastrophic effects on human, animal and environmental ecosystems. Pathogens, especially neglected tropical disease agents, are expected to emerge and re-emerge in several countries including Europe and North America.

M.; Meiswinkel, R.","Vector-borne animal diseases pose a continuous and substantial threat to livestock economies around the globe. Increasing international travel, the globalisation of trade, and climate change are likely to play a progressively more important role in the introduction, establishment and spread of arthropod-borne pathogens worldwide. A review of the literature reveals that many climatic variables, functioning singly or in combination, exert varying effects on the distribution and range of Culicoides vector midges and mosquitoes. For example, higher temperatures may be associated with increased insect abundance thereby amplifying the risk of disease transmission but there are no indications yet of dramatic shifts occurring in the geographic range of Culicoides midges. However, the same cannot be said for mosquitoes: over the last few decades, multiple Asian species have established themselves in Europe, spread and are unlikely to ever be eradicated. Research on how insects respond to changes in climate is still in its infancy. The authors argue that we need to grasp how other annectant changes, such as extremes in precipitation (drought and flooding), may affect the dispersal capability of mosquitoes. Models are useful for assessing the interplay between mosquito vectors expanding their range and the native flora and fauna; however, ecological studies employing classical mark-release-recapture techniques remain essential for addressing fundamental questions about the survival and dispersal of mosquito species, with the resulting parameters fed directly into new-generation disease transmission models. Studies on the eventual impact of mosquitoes on animal and human health should be tackled through large-scale integrated research programmes.

D.; Dalby, L.","The term 'short-stopping' is increasingly used in ecology to describe spatio-temporal changes in occurrence of migratory species. Spurred by the insight that it has been used in a variety of contexts, we reviewed its use in avian ecology. A literature search yielded 59 papers explicitly treating short-stopping in birds, most of them in peer-reviewed journals. The term was first used in 1967 to describe a northward shift in wintering Canada Geese in North America and has been used with increasing frequency to the present day. Geese dominate the short-stopping literature, which is confined to the northern hemisphere. Short-stopping has been used to describe (1) a shortened autumn migration that results in a wintering distribution closer to breeding areas, (2) a shortened spring migration that results in a breeding distribution closer to wintering areas, and (3) a delay in autumn migration that leads to a perceived reduced abundance in some part of the winter range. We advocate that short-stopping should be used only to describe (1) range shifts that involve shortening of the migratory corridor, and that they are qualified explicitly by season (i.e. breeding/winter) and degree (i.e. full or partial range shift). In other cases of breeding, wintering or entire range shifts where the migratory corridor is elongated or remains the same, we recommend using the term 'range shift', qualified by season, geography and orientation (i.e. the direction of the range shift).

Implementing an ecosystem approach can contribute to climate change adaptation by improving ecosystem resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, by providing planning strategies and tools to monitor and assess the impacts of climate change on fisheries, and by relying on precautionary, flexible, and adaptive approaches that account for the uncertainties, surprises, unpredictability, and dynamism of ecosystems in a changing climate. In this article, I provide an overview of some key considerations framing the mandate and capacity of regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements to implement ecosystem approaches in the context of climate change. The article first addresses the extent to which international law of the sea, and in particular the 1995 United Nations Fish Stock Agreement, endorses and implements an ecosystem approach to fisheries for the management of straddling and highly migratory stocks. It then addresses the barriers to more effective implementation of an integrated and adaptive ecosystem approach to fisheries in transboundary settings, including the decentralized and consensus-based nature of international law, stationary visions of ecosystems, and principles of certainty and stability. This analysis is then expanded to focus on specific challenges of adapting to climate-induced changes to transboundary stocks distribution and abundance. I address preparing and planning for climate change, responsive decision-making procedures, regulation of new fisheries, jurisdictional challenges, enhancing marine resilience, and revisiting allocation agreements, highlighting legal provisions and policy developments that may support or enhance the adaptive capacity of transboundary fisheries arrangements. I conclude that, despite some supportive legal provisions and practices, structural, legal, and political barriers severely hinder the pace and the scope of required governance and management responses to climate-induced changes to transboundary stocks.",2020,"DEC","Ecology and Society","25","4","","WOS:000603995100032","10.5751/ES-11988-250443","","#3464","Engler 2020","Tyler McIntosh (2024-09-03 08:50:34)(Select): global paper with very little that is specific to NAm, but suggest including given explicit discussions of a number of specific transboundary drivers & policies interacting with climate & biod

The adoption of an evolutionary ecology framework aimed to diminish the impact of tick-borne diseases needs to be part of strategies to protect human and animal populations. We present a review of current knowledge on the adaptation of ticks to their environment, and the impact that global change could have on their geographic distribution in North America. Environmental pressures will affect tick population genetics by selecting genotypes able to withstand new and changing environments and by altering the connectivity and isolation of several tick populations. Research in these areas is particularly lacking in the southern United States and most of Mexico with knowledge gaps on the ecology of these diseases, including a void in the identity of reservoir hosts for several tick-borne pathogens. Additionally, the way in which anthropogenic changes to landscapes may influence tick-borne disease ecology remains to be fully understood. Enhanced knowledge in these areas is needed in order to implement effective and sustainable integrated tick management strategies. We propose to refocus ecology studies with emphasis on metacommunity-based approaches to enable a holistic perspective addressing whole pathogen and host assemblages. Network analyses could be used to develop mechanistic models involving multihost-pathogen communities. An increase in our understanding of the ecology of tick-borne diseases across their geographic distribution will aid in the design of effective area-wide tick control strategies aimed to diminish the burden of pathogens transmitted by ticks.

Local to global drivers of plant disease change in response to disasters, often creating environments more conducive to plant disease. Most disasters have indirect effects on plant health through factors such as disrupted supply chains and damaged infrastructure. There is also the potential for direct effects from disasters, such as pathogen or vector dispersal due to floods, hurricanes, and human migration driven by war. Pulse stressors such as hurricanes and war require rapid responses, whereas press stressors such as climate change leave more time for management adaptation but may ultimately cause broader challenges. Smart solutions for the effects of disasters can be deployed through digital agriculture and decision support systems supporting disaster preparedness and optimized humanitarian aid across scales. Here, we use the disaster plant pathology framework to synthesize the effects of disasters in plant pathology and outline solutions to maintain food security and plant health in catastrophic scenarios.

However, increasing water demand from population growth and economic development, combined with more extreme and prolonged droughts due to climate change, poses significant challenges for governments in the 21st century. Improved understanding of the cascading multisectoral impacts and adaptive responses resulting from extreme drought can aid in adaptive planning and highlight key processes in modeling drought impacts. The record drought spanning 2008 to 2015 in the Colorado Basin in the state of Texas, United States, serves as an outstanding illustration to assess multisectoral impacts and responses to severe, multi-year drought.

Bats are a species-rich, globally distributed group of organisms that are thought to be particularly sensitive to the effects of climate change because of their high surface-to-volume ratios and low reproductive rates. We systematically reviewed the literature on bat responses to climate change to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge, identify research gaps and biases and highlight future research needs. We found that studies are geographically biased towards Europe, North America and Australia, and temperate and Mediterranean biomes, thus missing a substantial proportion of bat diversity and thermal responses. Less than half of the published studies provide concrete evidence for bat responses to climate change. For over a third of studied bat species, response evidence is only based on predictive species distribution models. Consequently, the most frequently reported responses involve range shifts (57% of species) and changes in patterns of species diversity (26%). Bats showed a variety of responses, including both positive (e.g. range expansion and population increase) and negative responses (range contraction and population decrease), although responses to extreme events were always negative or neutral. Spatial responses varied in their outcome and across families, with almost all taxonomic groups featuring both range expansions and contractions, while demographic responses were strongly biased towards negative outcomes, particularly among Pteropodidae and Molossidae. The commonly used correlative modelling approaches can be applied to many species, but do not provide mechanistic insight into behavioural, physiological, phenological or genetic responses. There was a paucity of experimental studies (26%), and only a small proportion of the 396 bat species covered in the examined studies were studied using long-term and/or experimental approaches (11%), even though they are more informative about the effects of climate change. We emphasise the need for more empirical studies to unravel the multifaceted nature of bats' responses to climate change and the need for standardised study designs that will enable synthesis and meta-analysis of the literature. Finally, we stress the importance of overcoming geographic and taxonomic disparities through strengthening research capacity in the Global South to provide a more comprehensive view of terrestrial biodiversity responses to climate change.",2023,"FEB","Biological Reviews","98","1","19-33","WOS:000842446000001","10.1111/brv.12893","","#3734","Festa 2023","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"116","Disturbances in deciduous temperate forest ecosystems of the northern hemisphere: their effects on both recent and future forest development","Fischer, A.; Marshall, P.; Camp, A.","Disturbances in forests can kill mature trees, but also create the conditions necessary for the establishment of new tree cohorts and create micro-habitats for new plant and animal species, thereby increasing the species diversity compared to undisturbed stands. We review the types and intensities of disturbances on forests in three regions of the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere: northeastern North America, Central Europe, and East Asia. We focus on (1) the ways in which disturbances affect forest stand development; (2) the differences among the three areas in this regard; (3) the consequences for future forest management. In both northeastern North America and East Asia, hurricanes and typhoons represent the major mode of natural disturbance, while in Central Europe winter windstorms occur after deciduous trees have lost their leaves. Tornadoes can have even greater destructive power (but affect relatively narrow strips of land), and the more severe of these mainly occur in North America. The general disturbance patch system therefore is relatively large in northeastern North America, small in Central Europe, and of intermediate size in temperate East Asia. In addition to wholly natural disturbance factors, human commerce and globalization have enabled new disturbance types by introducing pests and diseases from one region to another. In North America especially, several of the most important foundation species in temperate forests are strongly affected, so that not just the species composition but also the whole forest structure is changing fundamentally. In all three areas in the past the change in land use by growing human populations strongly affected the structure as well as the species composition of forests. Nearly all the recent forest stands of the temperate zone had been used in the past in a particular way, and many of today's forests had previously been converted into agricultural land. Finally climate change is superimposing itself on forest development worldwide. Nevertheless, climate change is not a new phenomenon, so forest ecosystems in all time periods have been exposed to changing climatic conditions and have had to adapt. Each forest stand therefore represents a unique recent expression of the interaction of environmental conditions and plant species, a """"snapshot"""" of the relevant abiotic and biotic factors, including human impact.",2013,"AUG","Biodiversity and Conservation","22","9","1863-1893","WOS:000322619300001","10.1007/s10531-013-0525-1","","#3768","Fischer 2013","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-17 13:43:46)(Select): Definitely some relevant examples!

M.","This paper addresses the impacts of climate change on forest fires and describes how this, in turn, will impact on the forests of the United States. In addition to reviewing existing studies on climate change and forest fires we have used two transient general circulation models (GCMs), namely the Hadley Centre and the Canadian GCMs, to estimate fire season severity in the middle of the next century. Ratios of 2 x CO2 seasonal severity rating (SSR) over present day SSR were calculated for the means and maximums for North America. The results suggest that the SSR will increase by 10-50% over most of North America; although, there are regions of little change or where the SSR may decrease by the middle of the next century. Increased SSRs should translate into increased forest fire activity. Thus, forest fires could be viewed as an agent of change for US forests as the fire regime will respond rapidly to climate warming. This change in the fire regime has the potential to overshadow the direct effects of climate change on species distribution and migration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

S.","The Holocene record of eolian sand and loess deposition is reviewed for numerous presently stabilized dune fields on the Great Plains of North America. Dune field activity reflects decade-to-century-scale dominance of drought that exceeded historic conditions, with a growing season deficit of precipitation > 25%. The largest dune fields, the Nebraska Sand Hills and ergs in eastern Colorado, Kansas and the Southern High Plains showed peak activity sometime between ca. 7 and 5 cal. ka. Loess deposition between ca. 10 and 4 cal. ka also signifies widespread aridity. Most dune fields exhibit evidence for one or more reactivation events sometime in the past 2 cal. ka; a number of localities register two events post 1 cal. ka, the latest potentially after 1400 AD. However, there is not a clear association of the latest dune remobilization events with up to 13 droughts in the past 2 cal. ka identified in dendroclimatic and lacustrine records. Periods of persistent drought are associated with a La Nina-dominated climate state, with cooling of sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean and later of the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico that significantly weakens cyclogenesis over central North America. As drought proceeds, reduced soil moisture and vegetation cover would lessen evaporative cooling arid increase surface temperatures. These surface changes strengthen the eastward expansion of a high-pressure ridge aloft and shift the jet stream northward, further enhancing continent-wide drought. Uncertainty persists if dune fields will reactivate in the future at a scale similar to the Holocene because of widespread irrigation, the lack of migratory bison herds, and the suppression of prairie fires, all of which enhance stabilization of dune fields in the Great Plains.

A global scan of the literature resulted in the consideration of 12 case studies of large water bodies within large watersheds, excluding in-lake geoengineering approaches. Although all of the systems experience excessive nutrient loading, they vary in two key ways: sources of nutrients and manifestations of eutrophication ranging from HABs, to limited recreational uses, to the additional complexity of internal loadings and fish kills, up to drinking water shutdowns. The case studies were analyzed with respect to four categories of approaches, namely: (i) regulatory; (ii) incentive-based; (iii) risk mitigation; and (iv) outreach, engagement, and educational.

Because of a coincidence of high species richness and human presence, Mediterranean biodiversity is particularly threatened by processes such as habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss, pollution, climate change and introduction of invasive species. Invasive tree pathogens are among the problematic exotic species of California, Chile, the Mediterranean, South Africa and Australia. In this review, we provide an update on a selection of non-native tree pathogens currently posing a threat in Mediterranean ecosystems. The impact of exotic forest pathogens range from large-scale tree and shrub mortality in native ecosystems (Phytophthora ramorum on the West Coast of the USA) to disruption of plantations of exotic (e.g., Seiridium cardinale on planted Monterey cypress in California, Fusarium circinatum on Monterey pine worldwide) and native trees (introduction of the North American Heterobasidion irregulare in stone pine woodland in Italy). Genetic analyses are instrumental in improving our understanding and management of these outbreaks. There is a need for more empirical data on how novel pathosystems are likely to develop under novel climates, as well as interdisciplinary collaborations among forest pathologists, theoretical modellers and climatologists.

We find that model and observational data suggest coastal upwelling-favorable winds in poleward portions of EBUS have intensified and will continue to do so in the future. Although evidence is weak in data that are presently available, future projections show that this pattern might be driven by changes in the positioning of the oceanic high-pressure systems rather than by deepening of the continental low-pressure systems, as previously proposed. There is low confidence regarding the future effects of climate change on coastal temperatures and biogeochemistry due to uncertainty in the countervailing responses to increasing upwelling and coastal warming, the latter of which could increase thermal stratification and render upwelling less effective in lifting nutrient-rich deep waters into the photic zone. Although predictions of ecosystem responses are uncertain, EBUS experience considerable natural variability and may be inherently resilient.

Increasingly, however, crops and livestock are produced in isolation, particularly in farms operating at the commercial scale. It has been suggested that re-integrating crop and livestock systems at the field and farm level could help reduce the pollution associated with modern agricultural production and increase yields. Despite this potential, there has been no systematic review to assess remaining knowledge gaps in both the social and ecological dimensions of integrated crop and livestock systems (ICLS), particularly within commercial agricultural systems. Based on a multi-disciplinary workshop of international experts and additional literature review, we assess the current knowledge and remaining uncertainties about large-scale, commercial ICLS and identify the source of remaining knowledge gaps to establish priorities for future research. We find that much is understood about nutrient flows, soil quality, crop performance, and animal weight gain in commercial ICLS, but there is little knowledge about its spatial extent, animal behavior or welfare in ICLS, or the tradeoffs between biodiversity, pest and disease control, greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, and drought and heat tolerance in ICLS. There is some evidence regarding the economic outcomes in commercial ICLS and supply chain and policy barriers to adoption, but little understanding of broader social outcomes or cultural factors influencing adoption. Many of these knowledge gaps arise from a basic lack of data at both the field and system scales, which undermines both statistical analysis and modeling efforts.

Data describing the epidemiology and ecology of IAVs among wildlife in the arctic are less frequently published compared to southern temperate regions, where prevalence and subtype diversity are more routinely documented. Following PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review addresses this gap by describing the prevalence, spatiotemporal distribution, and ecological characteristics of IAVs detected among wildlife and the environment in this understudied region of the globe. The literature search was performed in PubMed and Google Scholar using a set of pre-defined search terms to identify publications reporting on IAVs in Arctic regions between 1978 and February 2022. A total of 2125 articles were initially screened, 267 were assessed for eligibility, and 71 articles met inclusion criteria. IAVs have been detected in multiple wildlife species in all Arctic regions, including seabirds, shorebirds, waterfowl, seals, sea lions, whales, and terrestrial mammals, and in the environment. Isolates from wild birds comprise the majority of documented viruses derived from wildlife; however, among all animals and environmental matrices, 26 unique low and highly pathogenic subtypes have been characterized in the scientific literature from Arctic regions. Pooled prevalence across studies indicates 4.23% for wild birds, 3.42% among tested environmental matrices, and seroprevalences of 9.29% and 1.69% among marine and terrestrial mammals, respectively. Surveillance data are geographically biased, with most data from the Alaskan Arctic and many fewer reports from the Russian, Canadian, North Atlantic, and Western European Arctic. We highlight multiple important aspects of wildlife host, pathogen, and environmental ecology of IAVs in Arctic regions, including the role of avian migration and breeding cycles for the global spread of IAVs, evidence of inter-species and inter-continental reassortment at high latitudes, and how climate change-driven ecosystem shifts, including changes in the seasonal availability and distribution of dietary resources, have the potential to alter host-pathogen-environment dynamics in Arctic regions.

We evaluated whether refuge creation, changes in land use on the wintering and staging grounds, and climate warming have contributed to this expansion by affecting the distribution, habitat use, body condition, and migration phenology of birds. We also reviewed the effects of the increasing population on marshes on the wintering grounds, along the migratory routes and on the tundra in summer. Refuges established before 1970 may have contributed to the initial demographic increase. The most important change, however, was the switch from a diet entirely based on marsh plants in spring and winter (rhizomes of Scirpus/Spartina) to one dominated by crops (corn/young grass shoots) during the 1970s and 1980s. Geese now winter further north along the US Atlantic coast, leading to reduced hunting mortality. Their migratory routes now include portions of southwestern Quebec where corn production has increased exponentially. Since the mid-1960s, average temperatures have increased by 1-2.4 degrees C throughout the geographic range of geese, which may have contributed to the northward shift in wintering range and an earlier migration in spring. Access to spilled corn in spring improved fat reserves upon departure for the Arctic and may have contributed to a high fecundity. The population increase has led to intense grazing of natural wetlands used by geese although these habitats are still largely undamaged.

Here we review Arctic cod habitats, distribution, ecology, and physiology to assess how climate change and other anthropogenic stressors are affecting this key species. This review identifies vulnerabilities for different life stages across the entire distribution range of Arctic cod. We explore the impact of environmental (abiotic and biotic) and anthropogenic stressors on Arctic cod with a regional perspective in a scenario up to the year 2050 and identify knowledge gaps constraining predictions. Epipelagic eggs and larvae are more vulnerable to climate change and stressors than adults. Increased water temperatures, sea-ice decline, altered freshwater input, acidification, changing prey field, increased interspecific competition, new predators, and pollution are the principal stressors that will affect Arctic cod populations. Detrimental effects are likely to be greater in regions characterized by the advection of warmer Atlantic and Pacific waters. In contrast, Arctic cod may benefit from ocean warming in colder areas of the High Arctic. The risk from fisheries is moderate and primarily limited to bycatch. Overall, a decrease in suitable habitat and an associated decline in total Arctic cod biomass are predicted. In most Arctic seas, the relative abundance of Arctic cod within the fish community will likely fluctuate in accordance with cold and warm periods. A reduced abundance of Arctic cod will negatively affect the abundance, distribution, and physiological condition of certain predators, whereas some predators will successfully adapt to a more boreal diet.

Beginning in 2002, the USDA-APHIS collaboration with USDA-ARS and Texas Cooperative Extension programs began to supplement release sites in Texas beyond those initiated by the University of Texas, Austin phorid fly project. In 2005, private citizens began to participate in the spread of Pseudacteon to new sites. By fall 2006, P. tricuspis, expanding from releases between 1999 and 2001, was found on more than 3 million hectares of Central and Coastal Texas, while P. curvatus, with its later start, is only now beginning to expand at some sites. Pseudacteon that established more easily in mesic and moderate climates has difficulty surviving unfavorable weather in South Texas. However, two sites where flies """"failed"""" to become established were revealed to be false negatives after the record rains of summer 2007. Starting in late 2006, the first releases of P. obtusus Borgmeier in North America established, and three to five additional species are being released.",2008,"MAR","Southwestern Entomologist","33","1","15-29","WOS:000255486300002","10.3958/0147-1724-33.1.15","","#4270","Gilbert 2008","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"130","Threats to mangroves from climate change and adaptation options: A review","Gilman, E. L.; Ellison, J.; Duke, N. C.; Field, C.","Mangrove ecosystems are threatened by climate change. We review the state of knowledge of mangrove Vulnerability and responses to predicted climate change and consider adaptation options. Based on available evidence, of all the climate change outcomes, relative sea-level rise may be the greatest threat to mangroves. Most mangrove sediment surface elevations are not keeping pace with sea-level rise, although longer term studies from a larger number of regions are needed. Rising sea-level will have the greatest impact oil mangroves experiencing net lowering in sediment elevation, where there is limited area for landward migration. The Pacific Islands mangroves have been demonstrated to be at high risk of substantial reductions. There is less certainly over other climate change outcomes and mangrove responses. More research is needed on assessment methods and standard indicators of change in response to effects from climate change, while regional monitoring networks are needed to observe these responses to enable educated adaptation. Adaptation measures can offset anticipated mangrove losses and improve resistance and resilience to climate change. Coastal planning can adapt to facilitate mangrove migration with sea-level rise. Management of activities within the catchment that affect long-term trends in the mangrove sediment elevation, better management of other stressors oil mangroves, rehabilitation of degraded mangrove areas, and increases in systems of strategically designed protected area networks that include mangroves and functionally linked ecosystems through representation, replication and refugia, are additional adaptation options.

The review includes a synthesis of our knowledge regarding the main sources supplying moisture to the Arctic, the changes experienced over the last few decades due to variations in the transport of moisture, the factors that control interannual variability, and the inherent contrast in the mechanisms related to the effect of changes in moisture transport on SIE in the Arctic. We note that the precise identification of the moisture sources for the Arctic depends both on the definition of the Arctic region itself and on the approach used to identify the sources, with the remote regions over the extratropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans being universally important, as are some continental areas over Siberia and North America. This review also reaffirms the absence of any clear agreement regarding the trends in atmospheric moisture transport to the Arctic, and highlights discrepancies between different data sets and approaches in the quantification of moisture transport, implying that its long-term impact on the intensification of the hydrological cycle in the Arctic remains unclear. We confirm the influence of the major modes of climate variability, planetary circulation patterns, and the changes in cyclonic activity in the variability of moisture transport to the Arctic. We reaffirm that the effect of moisture transport on the Arctic SIE through changes in humidity, cloud cover, and precipitation over the Arctic is a complex scientific problem that requires further detailed study over the decades to come, and we propose some important challenges for future research.

At local and regional scales, other local human stressors (LS) can interact with CC and modify its effects on marine ecosystems. Understanding the response of the marine environment to the combined effects of CC and LS is crucial to inform marine ecosystem-based management and planning, yet our knowledge of the potential effects of such interactions is fragmented. At a global scale, we explored how cumulative effect assessments (CEAs) have addressed CC in the marine realm and discuss progress and shortcomings of current approaches. For this we conducted a systematic review on how CEAs investigated at different levels of biological organization ecological responses, functional aspects, and the combined effect of CC and HS. Globally, the effects of 52 LS and of 27 CC-related stressors on the marine environment have been studied in combination, such as industrial fisheries with change in temperature, or sea level rise with artisanal fisheries, marine litter, change in sediment load and introduced alien species. CC generally intensified the effects of LS at species level. At trophic groups and ecosystem levels, the effects of CC either intensified or mitigated the effects of other HS depending on the trophic groups or the environmental conditions involved, thus suggesting that the combined effects of CC and LS are context-dependent and vary among and within ecosystems. Our results highlight that large-scale assessments on the spatial interaction and combined effects of CC and LS remain limited. More importantly, our results strengthen the urgent need of CEAs to capture local-scale effects of stressors that can exacerbate climate-induced changes. Ultimately, this will allow identifying management measures that aid counteracting CC effects at relevant scales. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Specifically, we will focus on alphaviruses (Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus) and flaviviruses (Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus). Most of these viruses were originally found in tropical regions such as Africa and South America or in some regions in Asia. However, they have dispersed widely and currently cause diseases around the world. Global warming, increasing urbanization and population size in tropical regions, faster transportation and rapid spread of arthropod vectors contribute in continuous spreading of arboviruses into new geographic areas causing reemerging or resurging diseases.

Climate warming and subsequent landscape transformations result in rapid ecological change in Arctic freshwaters. Here we provide a synthesis of the diversity of benthic diatoms, plankton, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates, and fish in Arctic freshwaters. 2. We developed a multi-organism measure of alpha diversity to characterise circumpolar spatial patterns and their environmental correlates, and we assessed ecoregion-level beta diversity for all organism groups across the Arctic. 3. Alpha diversity was lowest at high latitudes and elevations and where dispersal barriers exist. Diversity was positively related to temperature, and both temperature and connectivity limited diversity on high latitude islands. Beta diversity was highly variable among ecoregions for most organism groups, ranging from 0 (complete similarity) to 1 (complete dissimilarity). The high degree of dissimilarity within many ecoregions illustrates the uniqueness of many Arctic freshwater communities. 4. Northward range expansion of freshwater taxa into Arctic regions may lead to increased competition for cold-stenothermic and cold-adapted species, and ultimately lead to the extinction of unique Arctic species. Societal responses to predicted impacts include: (1) actions to improve detection of changes (e.g., harmonised monitoring, remote sensing) and engagement with Arctic residents and Indigenous Peoples; and (2) actions to reduce the impact of unwanted changes (e.g., reductions of CO2 emissions, action against the spread of invasive species). 5. Current Arctic freshwater monitoring shows large gaps in spatial coverage, while time series data are scarce.

Quantifying the complex spatial dynamics taking place at range edges is critical for understanding future distributions of species, yet very few systems have sufficient data or the spatial resolution to empirically test these dynamics. This paper reviews how data from a large-scale pest management programme have provided important contributions to the fields of population dynamics and invasion biology. 2. The invasion of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) is well-documented from its introduction near Boston, Massachusetts USA in 1869 to its current extent of over 900,000 km(2) in Eastern North America. Over the past two decades, the USDA Forest Service Slow the Spread (STS) programme for managing the future spread of gypsy moth has produced unrivalled spatiotemporal data across the invasion front. 3. The STS programme annually deploys a grid of 60,000-100,000 pheromone-baited traps, currently extending from Minnesota to North Carolina. The data from this programme have provided the foundation for investigations of complex population dynamics and the ability to examine ecological hypotheses previously untestable outside of theoretical venues, particularly regarding invasive spread and Allee effects. 4. This system provides empirical data on the importance of long-distance dispersal and time-lags on population establishment and spatial spread. Studies showing high rates of spatiotemporal variation of the range edge, from rapid spread to border stasis and even retraction, highlight future opportunities to test mechanisms that influence both invasive and native species ranges. 5. The STS trap data have also created a unique opportunity to study low-density population dynamics and quantify Allee effects with empirical data. Notable contributions include evidence for spatiotemporal variation in Allee effects, demonstrating empirical links between Allee effects and spatial spread, and testing mechanisms of population persistence and growth rates at range edges. 6. There remain several outstanding questions in spatial ecology and population biology that can be tested within this system, such as the scaling of local ecological processes to large-scale dynamics across landscapes.

The capacity of communities and households to respond to these changes (i.e., their adaptive capacity) will determine the impacts of climate and co-occurring stressors. To date, empirical evidence linking theoretical measures of adaptive capacity to community and household responses remains limited. Here, we conduct a global meta-analysis examining how metrics of adaptive capacity translate to human responses to change (Adapt, React, Cope response) in 22 small-scale fishing case studies from 20 countries (n=191 responses). Using both thematic and qualitative comparative analysis, we evaluate how responses to climate, environmental, and social change were influenced by domains of adaptive capacity. Our findings show that adaptive responses at the community level only occurred in situations where the community had Access to Assets, in combination with other domains including Diversity and Flexibility, Learning and Knowledge, and Natural Capital. In contrast, Access to Assets was nonessential for adaptive responses at the household level. Adaptive households demonstrated Diversity and Flexibility when supported by strong Governance or Institutions and were often able to substitute Learning and Knowledge and Natural Capital with one another. Standardized metrics of adaptive capacity are essential to designing effective policies promoting resilience in natural resource-dependent communities and understanding how social and ecological aspects of communities interact to influence responses.

In many ice-sourced headwaters of western North America, stoneflies in the genus Lednia (Plecoptera: Nemouridae) are a prominent member of the invertebrate community. With a broad distribution in mountain streams and close ties to declining glacier cover, Lednia has emerged as a sentinel of climate change threats to high-elevation aquatic biodiversity. Lednia tumana, which is endemic to Glacier National Park, USA and the surrounding mountains, is the most well-studied species in the genus and in 2019 became federally protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) due to climate-induced loss of meltwater habitats. Three other Lednia species have also been described, and like L. tumana, each is endemic to a mountain region of western North America: Lednia sierra in the Sierra Nevada, Lednia borealis in the Cascade Range, and Lednia tetonica in the Teton Range. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of Lednia ecology, genetics, and physiology, with an emphasis on the conservation outlook for the group and species with similar headwater distributions. We highlight substantial progress made in the last decade to better understand the ecology and evolution of Lednia, including the identification of 140 Lednia-containing streams (an increase from 12 streams in 2010), and a more complete understanding of the degree to which warming streams may imperil species in the genus. In light of the ESA listing of L. tumana, we show that similar conservation threats likely face all extant Lednia species. However, substantial gaps in our knowledge remain, primarily centering around their distributions (and the potential for as yet undescribed species), life history, ecophysiology, and trophic ecology.

We summarize resilience assessments conducted in each system to provide a synthesis and reference by the other articles in this special feature. We also present a general framework used to evaluate the interactions between society and ecosystem regimes and the governance regimes chosen to mediate those interactions. The case studies show different ways that adaptive governance may be triggered, facilitated, or constrained by ecological and/or legal processes. The resilience assessments indicate that complex interactions among the governance and ecosystem components of these systems can produce different trajectories, which include patterns of (a) development and stabilization, (b) cycles of crisis and recovery, which includes lurches in adaptation and learning, and (3) periods of innovation, novelty, and transformation. Exploration of cross scale (Panarchy) interactions among levels and sectors of government and society illustrate that they may constrain development trajectories, but may also provide stability during crisis or innovation at smaller scales; create crises, but may also facilitate recovery; and constrain system transformation, but may also provide windows of opportunity in which transformation, and the resources to accomplish it, may occur.

E. M.","Implementation of wildfire- and climate-adaptation strategies in seasonally dry forests of western North America is impeded by numerous constraints and uncertainties. After more than a century of resource and land use change, some question the need for proactive management, particularly given novel social, ecological, and climatic conditions. To address this question, we first provide a framework for assessing changes in landscape conditions and fire regimes. Using this framework, we then evaluate evidence of change in contemporary conditions relative to those maintained by active fire regimes, i.e., those uninterrupted by a century or more of human-induced fire exclusion. The cumulative results of more than a century of research document a persistent and substantial fire deficit and widespread alterations to ecological structures and functions. These changes are not necessarily apparent at all spatial scales or in all dimensions of fire regimes and forest and nonforest conditions. Nonetheless, loss of the once abundant influence of low- and moderate-severity fires suggests that even the least fire-prone ecosystems may be affected by alteration of the surrounding landscape and, consequently, ecosystem functions. Vegetation spatial patterns in fire-excluded forested landscapes no longer reflect the heterogeneity maintained by interacting fires of active fire regimes. Live and dead vegetation (surface and canopy fuels) is generally more abundant and continuous than before European colonization. As a result, current conditions are more vulnerable to the direct and indirect effects of seasonal and episodic increases in drought and fire, especially under a rapidly warming climate. Long-term fire exclusion and contemporaneous social-ecological influences continue to extensively modify seasonally dry forested landscapes. Management that realigns or adapts fire-excluded conditions to seasonal and episodic increases in drought and fire can moderate ecosystem transitions as forests and human communities adapt to changing climatic and disturbance regimes. As adaptation strategies are developed, evaluated, and implemented, objective scientific evaluation of ongoing research and monitoring can aid differentiation of warranted and unwarranted uncertainties.",2021,"DEC","Ecological Applications","31","8","","WOS:000706158700001","10.1002/eap.2431","","#4731","Hagmann 2021","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-23 08:36:57)(Select): c1: yes

B.","Over the last decade, considerable progress has been made in developing vulnerability assessment tools and in applying these methodologies to identify and implement climate change adaptation approaches for forest ecosystems and forest management organizations in Canada and the United States. However, given that adaptation processes are in early stages, evaluation of approaches across agency, organizational, and geographic boundaries is critical. Thus, we conducted a qualitative comparison of three conceptual frameworks for climate change vulnerability assessment and adaptation efforts in the Canadian and United States forestry agency contexts. We focus our comparison on components of the conceptual frameworks, development process, intended users, similarities and differences in institutional contexts (geographic and organizational), and implementation. Finally, we present case studies to illustrate how the frameworks have been implemented on the ground and in different contexts. Despite different trajectories of development, the Canadian and US forest agencies have developed similar conceptual frameworks for vulnerability assessment and adaptation. We found that key components of the conceptual frameworks included: establishing a science-management partnership; evaluating current forest conditions and management objectives; conducting detailed science-based vulnerability assessments; developing adaptation approaches and on-the-ground tactics; implementing adaptation tactics; and monitoring outcomes and adjusting as needed.

"145","The state of glacier hydrology research in Canada","Hanly, K.; Marshall, S.; McDowell, G.","Glaciers across Canada are rapidly retreating, engendering significant implications for glacier-fed hydrological systems, ranging from aquatic ecology and groundwater recharge to downstream economic activities and traditional cultural values. Despite a well-developed body of literature regarding glacio-hydrological systems and dynamics, there has been no systematic assessment of this research to date. In response, this study adopted a systematic review methodology to examine the state of existing peer-reviewed glacio-hydrological literature in Canada (1900-2021). We found that peer-reviewed glacio-hydrological research in Canada emerged in the early 1950s and has substantially grown over the last two decades, with almost all work being done by natural scientists using field-based approaches to examine physical hydrology, water quantity and resources, and water quality in western Canada. There is a declining trend in research related to glacio-hydrological hazards and a relative lack of research related to glacier ecohydrology, human vulnerability, and adaptation. The absence of such work constrains our ability to adapt to the consequences of climatic change and other anthropogenic stressors. In highlighting these gaps, this study aims to inform research needs and contribute to evidence-based policy formation that supports regionally appropriate plans, enhancing our ability to navigate the current and future challenges facing glacio-hydrologic systems in Canada, including the human and non-human systems that depend on them.

Increasing international travel and trade of plant materials enhances the risk of introducing new viruses and their vectors into production systems. In addition, changing climate conditions can contribute to a successful spread of newly introduced viruses or their vectors and establishment of these organisms in areas that were previously unfavorable.

"147","A review of modern treeline migration, the factors controlling it and the implications for carbon storage","Hansson, A.; Dargusch, P.; Shulmeister, J.","Numerous studies have reported that treelines are moving to higher elevations and higher latitudes. Most treelines are temperature limited and warmer climate expands the area in which trees are capable of growing. Hence, climate change has been assumed to be the main driver behind this treeline movement. The latest review of treeline studies was published in 2009 by Harsch et al. Since then, a plethora of papers have been published studying local treeline migration. Here we bring together this knowledge through a review of 142 treeline related publications, including 477 study locations. We summarize the information known about factors limiting tree-growth at and near treelines. Treeline migration is not only dependent on favorable growing conditions but also requires seedling establishment and survival above the current treeline. These conditions appear to have become favorable at many locations, particularly so in recent years. The review revealed that at 66% of these treeline sites forest cover had increased in elevational or latitudinal extent. The physical form of treelines influences how likely they are to migrate and can be used as an indicator when predicting future treeline movements. Our analysis also revealed that while a greater percentage of elevational treelines are moving, the latitudinal treelines are capable of moving at greater horizontal speed. This can potentially have substantial impacts on ecosystem carbon storage. To conclude the review, we present the three main hypotheses as to whether ecosystem carbon budgets will be reduced, increased or remain the same due to treeline migration. While the answer still remains under debate, we believe that all three hypotheses are likely to apply depending on the encroached ecosystem. Concerningly, evidence is emerging on how treeline migration may turn tundra landscapes from net sinks to net sources of carbon dioxide in the future.",2021,"FEB","Journal of Mountain Science","18","2","291-306","WOS:000615794600001","10.1007/s11629-020-6221-1","","#4832","Hansson 2021","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The 2019 conference focused on assessing ecosystem health based on 61 indicators. Although there has been considerable improvement in the Detroit River since the 1960s, much additional cleanup is needed to restore ecosystem health. Western Lake Erie is now at risk of crossing several potential tipping points caused by the interactions of a variety of drivers and their stresses. This assessment identified eight environmental and natural resource challenges: climate change; population growth/transportation expansion/land use changes; chemicals of concern; human health/environmental justice; aquatic invasive species; habitat loss/degradation; nonpoint source pollution; and eutrophication/harmful algal blooms. Specific recommendations for addressing each challenge were also made. Climate change is the most pressing environmental challenge of our time and considered a ``threat multiplier"""" whereby warmer, wetter, and more extreme climatic conditions amplify other threats such as poor air quality effects on vulnerable residents, species changes, and nonpoint source runoff and combined sewer overflow events that contribute to eutrophication and can manifest as harmful algal blooms.

They also offer many benefits to humankind and are considered essential to the mitigation of the effects of climate change. Nevertheless, throughout the world they are suffering the most intense of anthropogenic pressures so are, of all ecosystems, among the most endangered. Here, we bring together and synthesise existing ecological understanding of the mechanisms underlying the high heterogeneity and diversity of temperate floodplain forests and of the pressures threatening their high biological value due to habitat homogenisation. Floodplain forests depend on the periodic disturbances under which they evolved, including fluvial dynamics, traditional management practices and the activities of herbivores. However, they have been heavily degraded by climate change, invasion of exotic species, river-flow regulation, landscape fragmentation, eutrophication and the cessation of traditional management. We can now observe two general trends in temperate floodplain forests: (1) Due to intensive landscape exploitation, they are now more open and thus prone to the spread of competitive species, including of invasive exotics and (2) Due to the cessation of traditional management, along with modified hydrological conditions, they are composed of species in the later successional stages (i.e., more shade-tolerant and mesic) while light-demanding species are quickly vanishing. Restoration practices have brought about contrasting results when restoration of floodplains to their natural states has been problematic. This is likely because of interplay between various natural and artificial processes not previously taken into proper consideration. We would like to draw attention to the fact that restoration projects or the preservation of existing floodplain forest ecosystems should combine the restoration of watercourses with the mitigation of other important threats acting at different scales of the landscape (spread of invasive species, eutrophication of watersheds and inappropriate forest management).",2023,"JAN 1","Science of the Total Environment","854","","","WOS:000867707800013","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158743","","#4936","Havrdová 2023","Elliott Parsons (2024-10-30 13:20:41)(Select): 1 (yes it is a review), 2 = yes, climate change impacts on hydrology, flooding, 3 = yes, mentions composition of forests, 4 = North America = yes (review restricted to northern hemisphere)., 5 = 1 (highly likely - map 1 C shows Canada & US.; Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-15 11:48:30)(Select): Figure 3 shows species at the U.S.-Canada border and the rest of the paper discusses changing floodplain areas.

F.","This synthesis focuses on the estuarine and ocean ecology of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) across their southern ranges in North America. General life history and ecology share many common traits including iteroparity, duration of freshwater (0-3 years) and marine (2-5 years) rearing, ocean emigration at relatively large sizes and strong surface orientation compared to other salmonids. Despite parallels in life history and anthropogenic pressures, several differences emerged for these species. First, steelhead have greater life history diversity and a broader geographic distribution. Generally, estuary habitats serve as short-term migration corridors for both species. However, some steelhead populations used lagoon habitat in south-coast watersheds. While both species are epipelagic, Atlantic salmon exhibit more vertical migration. Atlantic salmon tend to follow migratory highways-relatively narrow bands along the coastal shelf, then crossing the Atlantic to feed inshore and in fjords of West Greenland. Conversely, steelhead exit the coastal shelf quickly, dispersing across the Pacific, and rarely use coastal environments. Despite inhabiting rivers in warm dry Mediterranean climates, the extended range and stability of southern steelhead distribution is likely buffered by cool upwelled waters of the California Current. Whereas Atlantic salmon populations are restricted by warmer Northwest Atlantic circulation patterns lacking cool upwelling with greater susceptibility to warming associated with climate change. Determining the rate of marine habitat changes in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is important to the conservation of these species, including subtleties of temporal and spatial habitat use, and adaptability to ocean ecosystems under climate change.",2014,"SEP","Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries","24","3","757-780","WOS:000340455200006","10.1007/s11160-014-9348-8","","#4954","Hayes 2014","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Juvenile cod preyed on a wider range of taxa than larvae, but euphausiids were the main target prey. Analysis of regional variations in the relative abundances of C. finmarchicus and Para/Pseudocalanus spp. in the plankton, as estimated by the continuous plankton recorder (CPR) surveys, showed a similar geographical pattern to the larval cod stomach contents. Comparison of CPR data from the 1960s and 70s with data from the 1990s showed that the boundary between C. finmarchicus and Para/Pseudocalanus spp. dominance has shifted northwards on both sides of the Atlantic, whilst the abundance of euphausiids in the southern cod stock regions has declined.

While redistribution may be necessary for species persistence, there can also be impacts on existing communities upon arrival of novel, range-shifting species. Anticipating the beneficial versus deleterious impacts of range-shifting species is essential for determining whether active management is needed, which could include implementation of strategies from facilitation (eg managed relocation) to suppression (eg prevention and control). We used an impact assessment protocol developed for invasive species to evaluate potential consequences of range shifts in coastal marine ecosystems of North America. Our review demonstrates how invasion impact assessment combined with species vulnerability assessment could support decisions about management of range shifts. We found that similar to 50% of these shifting coastal species have had negative impacts in their expanded ranges.

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the ecophysiological effects of groundwater drawdown on phreatophytes and methodological approaches were synthesized from peer-reviewed articles published from 1988 to 2022. The highest relative count of studies was found in arid and semi-arid high-income countries, such as Australia and North America (18-24%), while the lowest relative count to no data was found in hyper-arid countries, such as north African countries (0-3.65%). The groundwater depth effects on phreatophyte ecophysiology had the highest relative count (53.65%), followed by large-scale tree plantation effects on the groundwater characteristics (44.37%) and groundwater depth and biological invasion relationship (1.99%). The results revealed that as the groundwater depth increased, the phreatophytic vegetation growth, productivity, and community structure decreased across the ecosystem types. A groundwater withdrawal also had a significant impact on the physiology of the phreatophytes, specifically on the transpiration rate, xylem water potential, hydraulic conductance, and photosynthetic rate. Many of the reviewed studies concluded that large-scale tree plantations can deplete groundwater resources due to an increased evapotranspiration rate. Further, species' diversity, evenness, dominance, composition, and distribution, as well as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), are commonly measured parameters in the reviewed studies through vegetation and groundwater monitoring.

Frameworks are intended to serve as international governance to help regulate corporate actions. However, companies' climate-related activities are voluntary and produce several issues. The current research addresses the following questions: How do international business frameworks work for governing and enforcing the practical implementation of corporate activities? In the future, what functions are expected to work for business sectors ensuring the 2050 goals?

First, the development process of the motivation of corporate activities is examined, from Corporate Social Responsibility to the long-term vision. Second, we conduct a thorough review of the public and private regimes and identify three key components of private regimes to achieve effective, legitimate, and compliant functions: participation, accountability, and norms. These three components are not ensured by one regime, but by different types of international frameworks: industry associations, international organizations, and third parties. This study illustrates how these three types of frameworks work with the key components for enforcement.

C.; Pacillo, G.; Laderach, P.; Spillane, C.","The Central American Dry Corridor (CADC) is among the most climate-vulnerable regions worldwide. Climate change, commonly referred to as a """"threat multiplier"""" of pre-existing socioeconomic issues, already undermines rural livelihoods by reducing agricultural yields and income opportunities. This paper provides a review of climate-related migration in the CADC region while identifying the specific pathways by which climate change manifests itself as a threat multiplier to migration. Different forms of human mobility (seasonal/temporal/permanent and internal/international migration) are increasingly attempted as adaptation strategies by affected households to diversify incomes and offset climate impacts. Preferred intra-regional migrant destinations tend to be less climate-vulnerable and also less violent. Notably, climate change is not isolated from socioeconomic and political migration drivers. Erosion of rural livelihoods reduces the costs of engaging in illicit coping strategies (e.g., illegal crop production) and simultaneously favours rapid urbanisation, which is linked to (forced) gang recruitment, primarily affecting the youth. These processes contribute to extraordinarily high violence levels, which are a major push factor for migration on their own, ultimately challenging state authority. Moreover, as outmigration from the region is projected to increase, the observed securitisation of borders, particularly along the USA-Mexico border and the Mexico-Guatemala border, while unfit to limit migration attempts, make migration more desperate and dangerous, allowing organised crime to step in and exploit migration as an economic undertaking.

E.","P>The preceding articles in this series review the history, biology and management of white pine blister rust in North America, Europe and eastern Asia. In this integration, we connect and discuss seven recurring themes important for understanding and managing epidemics of Cronartium ribicola in the white pines (five-needle pines in subgenus Strobus). Information and action priorities for research and management of the pathogen, telial and aecial hosts, and their interactions are listed in a detailed Appendix. Syntheses focused on genetics, plant disease, invasive species or forest management have provided alternative but knowledgeable lessons on the white pine blister rust pathosystem. Two critical issues for the conservation of white pines are to sustain ecosystems affected by blister rust and to maintain genetic diversity for adaptive traits such as disease resistance. Forest genetics includes tree improvement and molecular techniques for research; their application can increase rust resistance by artificial and natural selection. Silviculture augments genetics with methods to deploy and enhance resistance as well as to regenerate and tend white pine stands. Although cultivated or wild Ribes might serve as inoculum sources, silviculture and horticulture can reduce the risk of serious impacts from blister rust using genetics for breeding and epidemiology for hazard assessment and disease control. Climate change threatens to cause major alterations in temperature and precipitation regimes, resulting in maladapted conifers succumbing to various diseases and insect outbreaks. In contrast, many white pine species have broad ecological ranges and are tolerant of harsh environments-traits that permit successful establishment and growth over wide geographic and altitudinal zones. Given appropriate management, white pines could thrive as valuable commercial and ecologically important keystone species. In an uncertain environment, adaptive management provides a learning and participatory approach for sustaining resilient ecosystems.",2010,"AUG","Forest Pathology","40","3-4","402-417","WOS:000280995700013","10.1111/j.1439-0329.2010.00665.x","","#5421","Hunt 2010","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Even so, the case studies also demonstrate that overarching themes amenable to policy can be identified. Global organizations and researchers from a multiplicity of disciplinary backgrounds have strong imperatives and unique but often overlooked capacity to innovate and experiment in addressing climate vulnerability-migration-health interlinkages.

In this article, we review some of this evidence, providing migration research examples that integrate environmental context and are applicable to core migration theories, including neoclassical economic and migration systems perspectives, the """"push-pull"""" framework, and the new economics of labor migration. We suggest that neglecting consideration of the natural environment may yield misspecified migration models that attribute migration too heavily to social and economic factors, particularly in the context of contemporary climate change. On the other hand, we suggest, failure to consider migration theory in climate scenarios may lead to simplistic projections and understandings, as in the case of """"climate refugees.""""

As fire regimes change, it is important to understand how mammals respond to these altered post-fire landscapes. Because fires vary in size, severity and landscape context, it is important to know the experimental designs and response variables used to address post-fire responses of mammals. We analysed 48 papers published from 1988 to 2015 that examined responses of small mammals to natural or prescribed fire in North American conifer forests. These papers used different experimental contrasts (e.g. burned vs unburned sites, time series, within-fire heterogeneity). Most studies (89.6%) presented species richness or index-derived abundances of common species as their response variable(s). Many studies did not fully describe the fires being examined; these omissions make it more difficult to interpret and compare results among studies. The limited scope of inference presented by the papers in this review leads us to recommend a minimal set of information that should be presented about each fire studied. We conclude by outlining how different experimental designs and response variables can be used for effective inference.

Given current and potential threats to biodiversity from climate change, fisheries, and aquaculture, we provide a summary review of Canada's progress in fulfilling its obligations to protect, conserve, recover, and responsibly exploit marine biodiversity. We conclude that Canada has made little substantive progress, when compared to most developed nations, in meeting its biodiversity commitments. Much of Canada's policy and rhetoric has not been operationalised, leaving many of the country's national and international obligations unfulfilled in some key areas, such as the establishment of marine protected areas and incorporation of the precautionary approach to fisheries management. We conclude that regulatory conflict within Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) and the absolute discretion exercised by the national Minister of Fisheries and Oceans contribute significantly to an unduly slow rate of policy and statute implementation. We recommend new approaches and measures to sustain Canadian marine biodiversity and new research initiatives to support scientific advice to decision-makers. Many recommendations focus on management actions required to meet existing commitments to biodiversity conservation. Overall, we conclude that the most effective strategy is to protect existing biological diversity and to rebuild depleted populations and species to restore natural diversity.

In response, coniferous forest ecosystems will transition toward dominance by fire-adapted hardwoods, shrubs, meadows, and grasslands, which may benefit some faunal communities, but not others. We describe factors that limit and promote faunal resilience to shifting wildfire regimes for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We highlight the potential value of interspersed nonforest patches to terrestrial wildlife. Similarly, we review watershed thresholds and factors that control the resilience of aquatic ecosystems to wildfire, mediated by thermal changes and chemical, debris, and sediment loadings. We present a 2-dimensional life history framework to describe temporal and spatial life history traits that species use to resist wildfire effects or to recover after wildfire disturbance at a metapopulation scale. The role of fire refuge is explored for metapopulations of species. In aquatic systems, recovery of assemblages postfire may be faster for smaller fires where unburned tributary basins or instream structures provide refuge from debris and sediment flows. We envision that more-frequent, lower-severity fires will favor opportunistic species and that less-frequent high-severity fires will favor better competitors. Along the spatial dimension, we hypothesize that fire regimes that are predictable and generate burned patches in close proximity to refuge will favor species that move to refuges and later recolonize, whereas fire regimes that tend to generate less-severely burned patches may favor species that shelter in place.

"165","Monarch Butterflies in Western North America: A Holistic Review of Population Trends, Ecology, Stressors, Resilience and Adaptation","James, D. G.","Monarch butterfly populations in western North America suffered a substantial decline, from millions of butterflies overwintering in California in the 1980s to less than 400,000 at the beginning of the 21st century. The introduction of neonicotinoid insecticides in the mid-1990s and their subsequent widespread use appears to be the most likely major factor behind this sudden decline. Habitat loss and unfavorable climates (high temperatures, aridity, and winter storms) have also played important and ongoing roles. These factors kept overwintering populations stable but below 300,000 during 2001-2017. Late winter storm mortality and consequent poor spring reproduction drove winter populations to less than 30,000 butterflies during 2018-2019. Record high temperatures in California during the fall of 2020 appeared to prematurely terminate monarch migration, resulting in the lowest overwintering population (1899) ever recorded. Many migrants formed winter-breeding populations in urban areas. Normal seasonal temperatures in the autumns of 2021 and 2022 enabled overwintering populations to return to around the 300,000 level, characteristic of the previous two decades. Natural enemies (predators, parasitoids, parasites, and pathogens) may be important regional or local drivers at times but they are a consistent and fundamental part of monarch ecology. Human interference (capture, rearing) likely has the least impact on monarch populations. The rearing of monarch caterpillars, particularly by children, is an important human link to nature that has positive ramifications for insect conservation beyond monarch butterflies and should be encouraged.",2024,"JAN","Insects","15","1","","WOS:001151481800001","10.3390/insects15010040","","#5638","James 2024","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-16 13:25:56)(Select): Monarchs migrate between Mexico and the US.

A.; Rollinson, D.","Zoonotic parasites are important causes of endemic and emerging human disease in northern North America and Greenland (the North), where prevalence of some parasites is higher than in the general North American population. The North today is in transition, facing increased resource extraction, globalisation of trade and travel, and rapid and accelerating environmental change. This comprehensive review addresses the diversity, distribution, ecology, epidemiology, and significance of nine zoonotic parasites in animal and human populations in the North. Based on a qualitative risk assessment with criteria heavily weighted for human health, these zoonotic parasites are ranked, in the order of decreasing importance, as follows: Echinococcus multilocularis, Toxoplasma gondii, Trichinella and Giardia, Echinococcus granulosus/canadensis and Cryptosporidium, Toxocara, anisakid nematodes, and diphyllobothriid cestodes. Recent and future trends in the importance of these parasites for human health in the North are explored. For example, the incidence of human exposure to endemic helminth zoonoses (e.g. Diphyllobothrium, Trichinella, and Echinococcus) appears to be declining, while water-borne protozoans such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Toxoplasma may be emerging causes of human disease in a warming North. Parasites that undergo temperature-dependent development in the environment (such as Toxoplasma, ascarid and anisakid nematodes, and diphyllobothriid cestodes) will likely undergo accelerated development in endemic areas and temperate-adapted strains/species will move north, resulting in faunal shifts. Food-borne pathogens (e.g. Trichinella, Toxoplasma, anisakid nematodes, and diphyllobothriid cestodes) may be increasingly important as animal products are exported from the North and tourists, workers, and domestic animals enter the North.

"167","Old problems on a new playing field: Helminth zoonoses transmitted among dogs, wildlife, and people in a changing northern climate","Jenkins, E. J.; Schurer, J. M.; Gesy, K. M.","Although surveillance is limited, indigenous residents at latitudes ranging from 53 to 73 degrees N in Canada appear to have a higher occurrence of infection with some zoonotic parasites than the general population. Conversely, they are relatively naive to other zoonotic parasites that have previously been unable to establish at northern latitudes. For those parasites that circulate among dogs, wildlife, and people, potential risk factors in the North include limited availability of veterinary services, presence of free-roaming dog populations, and consumption of locally harvested fish and wildlife. These regions are also experiencing some of the greatest impacts of climate change in North America, including increased temperature, precipitation, and frequency and severity of extreme weather. We review the current taxonomy, genetic diversity, host and geographic distributions, epidemiology and risk factors for 3 genera of helminths (Diphyllobothrium spp., Echinococcus spp., and Toxocara sp.) in Canada's North in order to identify climate-sensitive aspects of their ecology. Free-living stages of parasitic zoonoses endemic in the Arctic (such as Diphyllobothrium dendriticum, the cervid strain of Echinococcus granulosus, and Arctic strains of Echinococcus multilocularis) will experience trade-offs between enhanced survival under wetter conditions and increased mortality under warmer conditions. Climate change might also lead to the introduction and establishment in the Arctic of parasitic zoonoses previously restricted to the sub-Arctic, such as Diphyllobothrium latum, Toxocara cants, and the prairie strain of E. multilocularis. Molecular techniques applied in broad geographic surveys are needed to address critical knowledge gaps in the geographic distribution, genetic diversity, and public health significance of zoonotic helminths already in the circumpolar North, and to determine the current barriers to range expansion of temperate-adapted parasites into the North. Dogs will continue to play important roles in the North, including that of a """"bridging"""" host between sylvatic cycles and human communities. In a warming north, increased opportunities for business, agriculture, and tourism favor importation of dogs and their parasites into a newly suitable environment. Collaborations among veterinarians, public health personnel, and policy-makers are needed to enhance surveillance and mitigate for dog-transmitted parasitic zoonoses in a changing North.

M.","To avoid irreversible climate damages, countries with different political systems must commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the world. The challenge posed to federal countries participating in international climate agreements through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is that successful implementation requires buy-in from their subnational governments. However, subnational climate action may not be aligned with the political priorities of the national government and could either undermine or support commitments made through the agreement. To explore these dynamics, we review the incoherence between international commitments, national and subnational policies of Canada and the United States, relying on case studies of investments in low-carbon energy and emissions outcomes. Political and policy incoherence has flowed in both directions. Both countries have seen periods of federal government action, which have been undermined by subnational inaction or opposition. Similarly, both countries have seen periods of federal government inaction, which has placed the onus on subnational governments. Our analysis enables a greater understanding about how the dynamics of federalist political systems influence policy, thus the energy investment and emissions outcomes of national commitments to international agreements. The implications of our findings for other federalist political systems are discussed. We suggest that during national leadership voids, subnational governments can counteract the associated negative policy outcomes by implementing climate policies that support low-carbon technologies and reducing emissions.

Many observers now believe that a """"new"""" climate governance is emerging through transnational and/or local forms of action that will eventually plug the resulting governance gaps. Yet states, which remain oddly absent from most discussions of the """"new"""" governance, will remain key players as governance becomes more polycentric. This paper introduces a special issue that explores the ability of states to rise to these interconnected challenges through the analytical prism of policy innovation. It reveals that policy innovation is much more multi-dimensional than is often thought; it encompasses three vital activities: invention (centering on the 'source' of new policy elements), diffusion (that produces different 'patterns' of policy adoption), and the evaluation of the 'effects' that such innovations create in reality. The papers, which range from qualitative case studies to large 'n' quantitative studies, offer new insights into the varied roles that states play in relation to all three. They show, for instance that: the policy activity of states has risen dramatically in the past decade; that state innovation is affected to similar degrees by internal and external factors; and that policies that offer flexibility to target groups on how to meet policy goals are most effective but that voluntary reporting requirements are ineffective. This paper draws upon these and many other insights to offer a much more nuanced reflection on the future of climate governance; one that deservedly puts states at the front and center of analysis.

M.; Stimmelmayr, R.; Stephen, C.; Walzer, C.","The COVID-19 pandemic has re-focused attention on mechanisms that lead to zoonotic disease spillover and spread. Commercial wildlife trade, and associated markets, are recognized mechanisms for zoonotic disease emergence, resulting in a growing global conversation around reducing human disease risks from spillover associated with hunting, trade, and consumption of wild animals. These discussions are especially relevant to people who rely on harvesting wildlife to meet nutritional, and cultural needs, including those in Arctic and boreal regions. Global policies around wildlife use and trade can impact food sovereignty and security, especially of Indigenous Peoples. We reviewed known zoonotic pathogens and current risks of transmission from wildlife (including fish) to humans in North American Arctic and boreal biomes, and evaluated the epidemic and pandemic potential of these zoonoses. We discuss future concerns, and consider monitoring and mitigation measures in these changing socio-ecological systems. While multiple zoonotic pathogens circulate in these systems, risks to humans are mostly limited to individual illness or local community outbreaks. These regions are relatively remote, subject to very cold temperatures, have relatively low wildlife, domestic animal, and pathogen diversity, and in many cases low density, including of humans. Hence, favorable conditions for emergence of novel diseases or major amplification of a spillover event are currently not present. The greatest risk to northern communities from pathogens of pandemic potential is via introduction with humans visiting from other areas. However, Arctic and boreal ecosystems are undergoing rapid changes through climate warming, habitat encroachment, and development; all of which can change host and pathogen relationships, thereby affecting the probability of the emergence of new (and re-emergence of old) zoonoses. Indigenous leadership and engagement in disease monitoring, prevention and response, is vital from the outset, and would increase the success of such efforts, as well as ensure the protection of Indigenous rights as outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Red List indices show that these migrants have become more threatened since 1988, with 33 species deteriorating and just six improving in status. There is also increasing evidence of regional declines. Population trend data show that more Nearctic-Neotropical migrants have declined than increased in North America since the 1980s, and more Palearctic-Afrotropical migrants breeding in Europe declined than increased during 1970-2000. Reviews of the status of migratory raptors show unfavourable conservation status for 51% of species in the African-Eurasian region (in 2005), and 33% of species in Central, South and East Asia (in 2007). Land-use change owing to agriculture is the most frequently cited threat affecting nearly 80% of all threatened and near-threatened species. However, while agricultural intensification on the breeding grounds is often proposed as the major driver of declines in Palearctic-Afrotropical migrants, some species appear to be limited by the quantity and quality of available habitat in non-breeding areas, notably the drylands of tropical Africa. Forest fragmentation in breeding areas has contributed to the declines of Nearctic-Neotropical migrants with deforestation in non-breeding areas another possible factor. Infrastructure development including wind turbines, cables, towers and masts can also be a threat. Over-harvesting and persecution remain serious threats, particularly at key migration locations. Climate change is affecting birds already, is expected to exacerbate all these pressures, and may also increase competition between migratory and non-migratory species. The conservation of migratory birds thus requires a multitude of approaches. Many migratory birds require effective management of their critical sites, and Important Bird Areas (IBAs) provide an important foundation for such action; however to function effectively in conserving migratory species, IBAs need to be protected and the coherence of the network requires regular review. Since many migratory species (c. 55%) are widely dispersed across their breeding or non-breeding ranges, it is essential to address the human-induced changes at the wider landscape scale, a very considerable challenge. Efforts to conserve migratory birds in one part of the range are less effective if unaddressed threats are reducing these species' populations and habitats elsewhere. International collaboration and coordinated action along migration flyways as a whole are thus key elements in any strategy for the conservation of migratory birds.",2008,"SEP","Bird Conservation International","18","","S49-S73","WOS:000259453100005","10.1017/S0959270908000439","","#6280","Kirby 2008","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

M.","Vector-borne disease incidence and burden are on the rise. Weather events and climate patterns are known to influence vector populations and disease distribution and incidence. Changes in weather trends and climatic factors can shift seasonal vector activity and host behavior, thus altering pathogen distribution and introducing diseases to new geographic regions. With the upward trend in global temperature, changes in the incidence and distribution of disease vectors possibly linked to climate change have been documented. Forecasting and modeling efforts are valuable for incorporating climate into predicting changes in vector and vector-borne disease distribution. These predictions serve to optimize disease outbreak preparedness and response. The purpose of this scoping review was to describe the use of climate data in vector-borne disease prediction in North America between 2000 and 2022. The most investigated diseases were West Nile virus infection, Lyme disease, and dengue. The uneven geographical distribution of publications could suggest regional differences in the availability of surveillance data required for vector-borne disease predictions and forecasts across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Studies incorporated environmental data from ground-based sources, satellite data, previously existing data, and field-collected data. While environmental data such as meteorological and topographic factors were well-represented, further research is warranted to ascertain if relationships with less common variables, such as oceanographic characteristics and drought, hold among various vector populations and throughout wider geographical areas.

Negative correlations between the Den Oever glass eel recruitment index (DOI) and the North Atlantic Oscillation Index since 1938 are discussed, together with older anecdotal evidence. Correlations are established between the DOI and sea surface temperature anomalies at 100-250 in between 1952 and 1995 in the Sargasso Sea/Sub-Tropical Gyre (STG) spawning area. It is hypothesised that, associated with global warming trends, STG warming inhibits spring thermocline mixing and nutrient circulation, with negative impacts on productivity and hence food for leptocephalus larvae. Concurrent gyre spin-up also affects major currents and slowing of oceanic migration has probably enhanced starvation and predation losses. Local factors, such as unfavourable wind-driven currents, can also affect recruitment of glass eels on continental shelves. In contrast, evidence is discussed that indicates fishing mortality and continental climate change appear to have had lesser impacts. Similar starvation-advection explanations for declines in Japanese eel recruitment are proposed. Predictions for the future are made and multidisciplinary and integrated monitoring and research are recommended for managing eel stocks and fisheries. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

A.; Levenstein, B.; Watson, A.; Ivanova, I.; Lento, J.","Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic have for millennia relied on freshwaters for drinking water and freshwater species that comprise important subsistence harvests, which promotes a strong connection to the land and unique understanding of organisms and ecosystem processes and changes. Despite the importance of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services to Arctic Indigenous communities, there have been limited attempts to summarise available Indigenous Knowledge (IK) regarding Arctic freshwater systems and to understand how conservation can benefit from this knowledge base. This paper presents a systematic review of literature documenting circumpolar Arctic IK with a focus on freshwater biodiversity in Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland), Russia, and the U.S.A. (Alaska). Standardised search terms and methodologies were used to locate relevant documents using Google Scholar and Google Advanced search engines. Thematic coding was used to identify freshwater biodiversity themes within the identified documents. Documented IK of freshwater biodiversity was found from all five geographic regions and included data on both species presence and habitat changes with potential to affect biodiversity. Canada had the highest number of relevant documents (n = 127), followed by the U.S.A. (Alaska;n = 116), Fennoscandia (n = 38), Russia (n = 27), and Greenland (n = 5). The number of relevant documents with IK published per year was highest in most recent years, from 2010 onwards, in all geographic regions. Fish represented the highest number of faunal observations with 59 species observed, approximately half of which were Salmonidae (29 species). Local-scale assessment of fish diversity found observations of the highest number of species (11-25) in Alaska, and individual observations of 6-10 species were found throughout Alaska, mainland areas of Canada, and the Kola Peninsula in Russia. Documented IK also contributed new information on historical fish diversity and indicated local-scale loss or gain of species. Such information is of vital importance to provide long-term records of fish composition and abundance, especially when this information does not exist in other knowledge bases such as western science datasets. Indigenous Knowledge included observations of changes in freshwater and terrestrial habitat associated with a warming climate, such as: decreasing water levels and more draining/drying of lakes and rivers, a shorter period of ice cover (late freeze and early break-up), decreasing ice thickness, and increasing occurrence of permafrost thaw and eroding banks. Such observations by those who actively rely on Arctic freshwater ecosystem services are important because they signify that change is occurring and that action is needed to mitigate the impacts on freshwater habitats and the biodiversity therein. This study demonstrates that previously documented IK provides valuable information towards determining freshwater biodiversity baselines and patterns of change in the circumpolar Arctic. However, these results do not sufficiently cover the depth and breadth of IK on freshwater biodiversity and ecology held by Indigenous communities. Further work incorporating Indigenous worldviews around freshwater ecology would provide context to the knowledge collected and a deeper understanding of Arctic circumpolar freshwater environments.",2022,"JAN","Freshwater Biology","67","1","194-209","WOS:000546714600001","10.1111/fwb.13570","","#6344","Knopp 2022","","Biophysical",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

L.","Multi-trophic conservation and management strategies may be necessary if reciprocal linkages between primary producers and their consumers are strong. While herbivory on aquatic plants is well-studied, direct top-down control of seagrass populations has received comparatively little attention, particularly in temperate regions. Herein, we used qualitative and meta-analytic approaches to assess the scope and consequences of avian (primarily waterfowl) herbivory on temperate seagrasses of the genus Zostera. Meta-analyses revealed widespread evidence of spatio-temporal correlations between Zostera and waterfowl abundances as well as strong top-down effects of grazing on Zostera. We also documented the identity and diversity of avian species reported to consume Zostera and qualitatively assessed their potential to exert top-down control. Our results demonstrate that Zostera and their avian herbivores are ecologically linked and we suggest that bird herbivory may influence the spatial structure, composition, and functioning of the seagrass ecosystem. Therefore, the consequences of avian herbivory should be considered in the management of seagrass populations. Of particular concern are instances of seagrass overgrazing by waterfowl which result in long-term reductions in seagrass biomass or coverage, with subsequent impacts on local populations of waterfowl and other seagrass-affiliated species. While our results showed that bird density and type may affect the magnitude of the top-down effects of avian herbivory, empirical research on the strength, context-dependency, and indirect effects of waterfowl-Zostera interactions remains limited. For example, increased efforts that explicitly measure the effects of different functional groups of birds on seagrass abundance and/or document how climate change-driven shifts in waterfowl migratory patterns impact seagrass phenology and population structure will advance research programs for both ecologists and managers concerned with the joint conservation of both seagrasses and their avian herbivores.",2017,"DEC 22","Frontiers in Plant Science","8","","","WOS:000418578300001","10.3389/fpls.2017.02119","","#6378","Kollars 2017","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

D.; Navarro, C.; Padolina, C.; Bordacs, S.; Jamnadass, R.; Graudal, L.; Ramamonjisoa, L.","Over the last 200 years, genetic resources of forest trees have been increasingly transferred, within and outside of species' native distribution ranges, for forestry and for research and development (R&D). Transferred germplasm has been deployed to grow trees for numerous purposes, ranging from the production of wood and non-wood products to the provision of ecosystem services such as the restoration of forests for biodiversity conservation. The oldest form of R&D, provenance trials, revealed early on that seed origin has a major influence on the performance of planted trees. International provenance trials have been essential for selecting seed sources for reforestation and for improving tree germplasm through breeding. Many tree breeding programmes were initiated in the 1950s, but as one round of testing and selection typically takes decades, the most advanced of them are only in their third cycle. Recent advances in forest genomics have increased the understanding of the genetic basis of different traits, but it is unlikely that molecular marker-assisted approaches will quickly replace traditional tree breeding methods. Furthermore, provenance trials and progeny tests are still needed to complement new research approaches. Currently, seed of boreal and temperate trees for reforestation purposes are largely obtained from improved sources. The situation is similar for fast growing tropical and subtropical trees grown in plantations, but in the case of tropical hardwoods and many agroforestry trees, only limited tested or improved seed sources are available. Transfers of tree germplasm involve some risks of spreading pests and diseases, of introducing invasive tree species and of polluting the genetic make-up of already present tree populations. Many of these risks have been underestimated in the past, but they are now better understood and managed. Relatively few tree species used for forestry have become invasive, and the risk of spreading pests and diseases while transferring seed is considerably lower than when moving live plants. The implementation of the Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and benefit sharing (ABS) may significantly change current transfer practices in the forestry sector by increasing transaction costs and the time needed to lawfully obtain forest genetic resources for R&D purposes. Many countries are likely to struggle to establish a well-functioning ABS regulatory system, slowing down the process of obtaining the necessary documentation for exchange. This is unfortunate, as climate change, outbreaks of pests and diseases, and continual pressure to support productivity, increase the need for transferring tree germplasm and accelerating R&D.

L.","Climate change is affecting physical and biological components and processes of marine ecosystems in many ways. Resulting changes in abundance and distribution of commercially valuable species are anticipated to create or exacerbate challenges for fisheries management across national boundaries by raising questions around catch allocation, membership in the management organizations, and forms of cooperation between the organizations. In this paper we assess eight transboundary fisheries arrangements in the Northwest Atlantic and North Pacific on their preparedness to respond to climate-change driven changes. For each arrangement a three-part analysis is provided. A general introduction to fisheries management responsibilities, including species and geographic scope, is first followed by a review of how climate-related science is being supported and a discussion of how climate change is being addressed directly or indirectly in management. The review shows that none of the examined treaties and founding documents mention climate change or direct parties to include climate change in their research programs and management measures. Nevertheless, climate change is on the radar screen of all eight arrangements although adopting management approaches that do not rely on single stock assessments remains politically difficult. The seaworthiness of the eight arrangements to address climate change varies considerably. Three arrangements were categorized as the most seaworthy for investing significant resources in ecosystem-based management and climate science. Three were assessed to be moderately seaworthy for recognizing precautionary and ecosystem approaches in their treaties, or for taking steps toward this objective, as well as supporting climate science. However, they are relying on single-stock management and, at times, struggle with making decisions based on scientific evidence. Two arrangements appear to be least seaworthy because they are largely ignoring climate change and the need for an ecosystem approach in their management or have inadequate legal tools to address these needs effectively.",2020,"DEC","Ecology and Society","25","4","","WOS:000603995100011","10.5751/ES-11835-250442","","#6445","Koubrak 2020","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-26 11:02:43)(Select): review of fisheries management that is explicitly transboundary and focused on whether/how much climate change impacts these agreements.

The warming and resultant longer open water periods suggest a potential for expansion of marine vegetation along the vast Arctic coastline. We compiled and reviewed the scattered time series on Arctic marine vegetation and explored trends for macroalgae and eelgrass (Zostera marina). We identified a total of 38 sites, distributed between Arctic coastal regions in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway/Svalbard, and Russia, having time series extending into the 21st Century. The majority of these exhibited increase in abundance, productivity or species richness, and/or expansion of geographical distribution limits, several time series showed no significant trend. Only four time series displayed a negative trend, largely due to urchin grazing or increased turbidity. Overall, the observations support with medium confidence (i.e., 5-8 in 10 chance of being correct, adopting the IPCC confidence scale) the prediction that macrophytes are expanding in the Arctic. Species distribution modeling was challenged by limited observations and lack of information on substrate, but suggested a current (20002017) potential pan-Arctic macroalgal distribution area of 820.000 km(2) (145.000 km 2 intertidal, 675.000 km(2) subtidal), representing an increase of about 30% for subtidaland 6% for intertidal macroalgae since 1940-1950, and associated polar migration rates averaging 18-23 km decade(-1). Adjusting the potential macroalgal distribution area by the fraction of shores represented by cliffs halves the estimate (412,634 km(2)). Warming and reduced sea ice cover along the Arctic coastlines are expected to stimulate further expansion of marine vegetation from boreal latitudes. The changes likely affect the functioning of coastal Arctic ecosystems because of the vegetation's roles as habitat, and for carbon and nutrient cycling and storage.

Understanding the underlying ecological drivers of bear responses to climate variability and change, and the implications for conflict, will be critical for maintaining human-bear coexistence in North America. We synthesized 120 articles that identified direct and indirect mechanisms by which climate variability and change affect brown bears (Ursus arctos) and American black bears (Ursus americanus) in North America. The literature focused on examining climate impacts on bear diet, body size, habitat selection, space use, activity, denning chronology, and population demographics and dynamics. Across these categories, we summarized the documented and projected bear responses and resulting implications for human-bear interactions. Climate-driven changes in natural food availability were frequently implicated in influencing bear behavior and demography, and creating conditions under which interactions with humans are likely to increase. Bears in North America may face increased challenges as habitat and natural food availability continue to be altered by climate change. Our review provides a foundation upon which to identify climate drivers of bear ecology, conditions conducive to human-bear interactions, and adaptive management strategies.

A Synthesis","Laamrani, A.; Valeria, O.; Chehbouni, A.; Bergeron, Y.","Northern boreal forests are characterized by accumulation of accumulation of peat (e.g., known as paludification). The functioning of northern boreal forest species and their capacity to adapt to environmental changes appear to depend on soil conditions. Climate warming is expected to have particularly pronounced effects on paludified boreal ecosystems and can alter current forest species composition and adaptation by changing soil conditions such as moisture, temperature regimes, and soil respiration. In this paper, we review and synthesize results from various reported studies (i.e., 88 research articles cited hereafter) to assess the effects of climatic warming on soil conditions of paludified forests in North America. Predictions that global warming may increase the decomposition rate must be considered in combination with its impact on soil moisture, which appears to be a limiting factor. Local adaptation or acclimation to current climatic conditions is occurring in boreal forests, which is likely to be important for continued ecosystem stability in the context of climate change. The most commonly cited response of boreal forest species to global warming is a northward migration that tracks the climate and soil conditions (e.g., temperature and moisture) to which they are adapted. Yet, some constraints may influence this kind of adaptation, such as water availability, changes in fire regimes, decomposer adaptations, and the dynamic of peat accumulation. In this paper, as a study case, we examined an example of potential effects of climatic warming on future paludification changes in the eastern lowland region of Canada through three different combined hypothetical scenarios based on temperature and precipitation (e.g., unchanged, increase, or decrease). An increase scenario in precipitation will likely favor peat accumulation in boreal forest stands prone to paludification and facilitate forested peatland expansion into upland forest, while decreased or unchanged precipitation combined with an increase in temperature will probably favor succession of forested peatlands to upland boreal forests. Each of the three scenarios were discussed in this study, and consequent silvicultural treatment options were suggested for each scenario to cope with anticipated soil and species changes in the boreal forests. We concluded that, despite the fact boreal soils will not constrain adaptation of boreal forests, some consequences of climatic warming may reduce the ability of certain species to respond to natural disturbances such as pest and disease outbreaks, and extreme weather events.",2020,"NOV","Forests","11","11","","WOS:000593215700001","10.3390/f11111176","","#6637","Laamrani 2020","","Biophysical; Biotic; Intervention; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Tropical marine habitats and fish stocks, however, are vulnerable to the physical and biogeochemical oceanic changes associated with rising greenhouse gases. These changes to fish stocks, and subsequent impacts on fish production, have substantial implications for the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In this Review, we synthesize the effects of climate change on tropical marine fisheries, highlighting the socio-economic impacts to both tropical and extratropical nations, and discuss potential adaptation measures. Driven by ocean warming, acidification, deoxygenation and sea-level rise, the maximum catch potential of tropical fish stocks in some tropical exclusive economic zones is projected to decline by up to 40% by the 2050s under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario, relative to the 2000s. Climate-driven reductions in fisheries production and alterations in fish-species composition will subsequently increase the vulnerability of tropical countries with limited adaptive capacity. Thus, given the billions of people dependent on tropical marine fisheries in some capacity, there is a clear need to account for the effects of climate change on these resources and identify practical adaptations when building climate-resilient sustainable-development pathways.

Scientific evidence shows that meltwater of Arctic sources contributes to sea-level rise significantly while accounting for 35% of current global sea-level rise. Arctic communities have to find ways to deal with rapidly changing environmental conditions that are leading to social impacts such as outmigration, similarly to the global South. International debates on Loss and Damage have not addressed the Arctic so far. We review literature to show what impacts of climate change are already visible in the Arctic, and present local cases in order to provide empirical evidence of losses and damages in the Arctic region.

With water conflicts increasing due to stressors such as population growth, climate change, and aging infrastructure, stakeholder engagement holds the promise to improve decisions, save time and money, and improve relationships between governing bodies and stakeholders. This opinion paper reviews the benefits of engaging stakeholders in water supply management decision-making, assesses the current state of the practice, and predicts future trends in the North American setting. The current use of technology will undoubtedly continue, allowing water managers to engage more stakeholders and engage them more substantively. We predict increased roles for the private and nongovernmental sectors in stakeholder engagement, taking place at different scales, but with a focus on the local level. Evaluating the benefits and effectiveness of engagement processes will help justify the investments, and also support practitioners to determine the most appropriate tools and techniques. Finally, foundational principles of open communication, building and maintaining trust, and ethical decision-making must be placed front and center.

The number of studies has grown during this time in warm desert to forest ecosystems on primarily federal lands. The most common study topics included fire effects on native species, the role of invasive species and woody encroachment on wildfire risk, historical fire regimes, and remote sensing and modeling to study wildfire risk across the landscape. A majority of fuel treatment studies focused on prescribed burns, and fuel treatments collectively had mixed effects on mitigating future wildfire risk and threats to ecosystems depending on vegetation and fire characteristics.

I.; Reid, N.","In addition to abiotic determinants, biotic factors, including competitive, interspecific interactions, limit species' distributions. Environmental changes in human disturbance, land use and climate are predicted to have widespread impacts on interactions between species, especially in the order Lagomorpha due to the higher latitudes and more extreme environmental conditions they occupy. We reviewed the published literature on interspecific interactions in the order Lagomorpha and compared the biogeography, macroecology, phylogeny and traits of species known to interact with those of species with no reported interactions, to investigate how projected future environmental change may affect interactions and potentially alter species' distributions. Thirty-three lagomorph species have competitive interactions reported in the literature; the majority involve hares (Lepus sp.) or the eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus). Key regions for interactions are located between 30-50 degrees N of the Equator, and include eastern Asia (southern Russia on the border of Mongolia) and North America (north-western USA). Closely related, large-bodied, similarly sized species occurring in regions of human-modified, typically agricultural landscapes, or at high elevations, are significantly more likely to have reported competitive interactions than other lagomorph species. We identify species' traits associated with competitive interactions, and highlight some potential impacts that future environmental change may have on interspecific interactions. Our approach using bibliometric and biological data is widely applicable, and with relatively straightforward methodologies, can provide insights into interactions between species. Our results have implications for predicting species' responses to global change, and we advise that capturing, parameterizing and incorporating interspecific interactions into analyses (e.g. species distribution modelling) may be more important than suggested by the literature.",2015,"APR","Mammal Review","45","2","88-102","WOS:000351538600002","10.1111/mam.12035","","#6799","Leach 2015","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

G.; Ponte, R. M.; Thomas, M. D.","Scientific and societal interest in the relationship between the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and U.S. East Coast sea level has intensified over the past decade, largely due to (1) projected, and potentially ongoing, enhancement of sea level rise associated with AMOC weakening and (2) the potential for observations of U.S. East Coast sea level to inform reconstructions of North Atlantic circulation and climate. These implications have inspired a wealth of model- and observation-based analyses. Here, we review this research, finding consistent support in numerical models for an antiphase relationship between AMOC strength and dynamic sea level. However, simulations exhibit substantial along-coast and intermodel differences in the amplitude of AMOC-associated dynamic sea level variability. Observational analyses focusing on shorter (generally less than decadal) timescales show robust relationships between some components of the North Atlantic large-scale circulation and coastal sea level variability, but the causal relationships between different observational metrics, AMOC, and sea level are often unclear. We highlight the importance of existing and future research seeking to understand relationships between AMOC and its component currents, the role of ageostrophic processes near the coast, and the interplay of local and remote forcing. Such research will help reconcile the results of different numerical simulations with each other and with observations, inform the physical origins of covariability, and reveal the sensitivity of scaling relationships to forcing, timescale, and model representation.

F.","As one of the five components of Earth's climatic system, the cryosphere has been undergoing rapid shrinking due to global warming. Studies on the formation, evolution, distribution and dynamics of cryospheric components and their interactions with the human system are of increasing importance to society. In recent decades, the mass loss of glaciers, including the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, has accelerated. The extent of sea ice and snow cover has been shrinking, and permafrost has been degrading. The main sustainable development goals in cryospheric regions have been impacted. The shrinking of the cryosphere results in sea-level rise, which is currently affecting, or is soon expected to affect, 17 coastal megacities and some small island countries. In East Asia, South Asia and North America, climate anomalies are closely related to the extent of Arctic sea ice and snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere. Increasing freshwater melting from the ice sheets and sea ice may be one reason for the slowdown in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation in the Arctic and Southern Oceans. The foundations of ports and infrastructure in the circum-Arctic permafrost regions suffer from the consequences of permafrost degradation. In high plateaus and mountainous regions, the cryosphere's shrinking has led to fluctuations in river runoff, caused water shortages and increased flooding risks in certain areas. These changes in cryospheric components have shown significant heterogeneity at different temporal and spatial scales. Our results suggest that the quantitative evaluation of future changes in the cryosphere still needs to be improved by enhancing existing observations and model simulations.

Over centuries or millennia, Native Americans learned that they could enhance production of desired resources by regularly igniting low-intensity surface fires in stands of black oak. Although black oak is likely to remain widespread in the future, a warming climate, increasingly dense forests, and altered fire regimes threaten the large, full-crowned mature trees that produce crops of high-quality acorns and provide cavities for many wildlife species. To examine the effects of different kinds of burns on tribal values including associated plants, fungi, and wildlife of special cultural significance, we reviewed and synthesized scientific studies of black oak in conjunction with interviews and workshops with tribal members who use the species and recall burning by their ancestors. We conducted two exploratory analyses to understand trends in large black oaks and potential tradeoffs regarding black oak restoration.

L.; D'Antonio, C. M.; Dudley, T. L.; Fehlberg, S. D.; Gaskin, J. F.; Glenn, E. P.; Hultine, K. R.","Patterns of woody-plant mortality have been linked to global-scale environmental changes, such as extreme drought, heat stress, more frequent and intense fires, and episodic outbreaks of insects and pathogens. Although many studies have focussed on survival and mortality in response to specific physiological stresses, little attention has been paid to the role of genetic heritability of traits and local adaptation in influencing patterns of plant mortality, especially in non-native species. Tamarix spp. is a dominant, non-native riparian tree in western North America that is experiencing dieback in some areas of its range due to episodic herbivory by the recently introduced northern tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda carinulata). We propose that genotype x environment interactions largely underpin current and future patterns of Tamarix mortality. We anticipate that (i) despite its recent introduction, and the potential for significant gene flow, Tamarix in western North America is generally adapted to local environmental conditions across its current range in part due to hybridization of two species; (ii) local adaptation to specific climate, soil and resource availability will yield predictable responses to episodic herbivory; and (iii) the ability to cope with a combination of episodic herbivory and increased aridity associated with climate change will be largely based on functional tradeoffs in resource allocation. This review focusses on the potential heritability of plant carbon allocation patterns in Tamarix, focussing on the relative contribution of acquired carbon to non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools versus other sinks as the basis for surviving episodic disturbance. Where high aridity and/or poor edaphic position lead to chronic stress, NSC pools may fall below a minimum threshold because of an imbalance between the supply of carbon and its demand by various sinks. Identifying patterns of local adaptation of traits related to resource allocation will improve forecasting of Tamarix population susceptibility to episodic herbivory.",2017,"MAR 28","Conservation Physiology","5","","","WOS:000402600900001","10.1093/conphys/cox016","","#7357","Long 2017","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-16 07:09:31)(Select): including, as paper mentions southwestern USA and northern Mexico; Dayo Osinubi (2024-08-11 04:25:57)(Select): Review of local adaptations in an introduced or invasive plant species (Tamarix).

M.","Pinus strobiformis (southwestern white pine) is one of the least studied and understood five-needle white pine species in North America. Recently, this species has become increasingly challenged by Cronartium ribicola (white pine blister rust). This review examines literature relevant to P. strobiformis taxonomy, environmental associations, community associations, stand dynamics, and fire and disturbance ecology in order to better inform the management of this understudied species. In its US range, P. strobiformis occurs in central and southern Arizona and New Mexico and western Texas and has been documented as far north as southwestern Colorado. In Mexico, it occurs in northeastern Sonora, western Chihuahua and Durango, northern Zacatecas, southern Coahuila and central Nuevo Leon. Although P. strobiformis is a relatively high-elevation species preferring mesic habitats, it occurs across a variety of aspects, slope positions, and elevations. It rarely dominates forest composition but is most often found in complex species mixtures. While located in mixed-conifer habitats at the northern end of its range, it is associated with more diverse forest communities in the southern part of its range. Studies generally indicate P. strobiformis is a mid-seral species, although its low abundance and broad environmental amplitude complicate classification. Regeneration ecology is poorly understood, but bird and rodent seed dispersal do occur in portions of its range. Historical fire regimes in P. strobiformis mixed-conifer forests in the US were primarily characterized by frequent, low-severity surface fire, with less evidence of mixed- and high-severity fire. In Mexico, low-severity surface fire appears to have been ubiquitous within P. strobiformis habitats, with historical fire regimes still largely intact. Information is limited on the effects of disturbances other than fire. Increased temperatures and drought severity associated with climate change could potentially shrink the distribution of P. strobiformis, while altering its dominance in future forest communities. Future research on the ecology and management of P. strobiformis is necessary to effectively manage this species given climate change and white pine blister rust selection pressure.

The essay also reviews recent developments in mangrove ecology and ecophysiology that enlighten how mangroves might respond to changes in temperature and rainfall, sea level rise, and other anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Mangroves in the Anthropocene will also face changes in their species composition given the current movement of mangroves species across continental barriers as a result of human activity. These trends will lead to novel mangrove forests and in some cases expand the range of mangroves worldwide. The solution to mangrove persistence in the Anthropocene is not to isolate mangroves from people, but to regulate interactions between mangroves and humans through effective management.

Climate conditions can directly impact ungulates via changes in the costs of thermoregulation and locomotion, or indirectly, via changes in habitat and forage availability, predation, and species interactions. Many studies have documented the effects of climate variability and climate change on North America's ungulates, recording impacts to population demographics, physiology, foraging behavior, migratory patterns, and more. However, ungulate responses are not uniform and vary by species and geography. Here, we present a systematic map describing the abundance and distribution of evidence on the effects of climate variability and climate change on native ungulates in North America.Methods We searched for all evidence documenting or projecting how climate variability and climate change affect the 15 ungulate species native to the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Greenland. We searched Web of Science, Scopus, and the websites of 62 wildlife management agencies to identify relevant academic and grey literature. We screened English-language documents for inclusion at both the title and abstract and full-text levels. Data from all articles that passed full-text review were extracted and coded in a database. We identified knowledge clusters and gaps related to the species, locations, climate variables, and outcome variables measured in the literature.Review findings We identified a total of 674 relevant articles published from 1947 until September 2020. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus), elk (Cervus canadensis), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were the most frequently studied species. Geographically, more research has been conducted in the western U.S. and western Canada, though a notable concentration of research is also located in the Great Lakes region. Nearly 75% more articles examined the effects of precipitation on ungulates compared to temperature, with variables related to snow being the most commonly measured climate variables. Most studies examined the effects of climate on ungulate population demographics, habitat and forage, and physiology and condition, with far fewer examining the effects on disturbances, migratory behavior, and seasonal range and corridor habitat.Conclusions The effects of climate change, and its interactions with stressors such as land-use change, predation, and disease, is of increasing concern to wildlife managers. With its broad scope, this systematic map can help ungulate managers identify relevant climate impacts and prepare for future changes to the populations they manage. Decisions regarding population control measures, supplemental feeding, translocation, and the application of habitat treatments are just some of the management decisions that can be informed by an improved understanding of climate impacts. This systematic map also identified several gaps in the literature that would benefit from additional research, including climate effects on ungulate migratory patterns, on species that are relatively understudied yet known to be sensitive to changes in climate, such as pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), and on ungulates in the eastern U.S. and Mexico.",2024,"APR 4","Environmental Evidence","13","1","","WOS:001197165300001","10.1186/s13750-024-00331-8","","#7699","Malpeli 2024","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

"201","Shifting global <i>Larix</i> distributions: Northern expansion and southern retraction as species respond to changing climate","Mamet, S. D.; Brown, C. D.; Trant, A. J.; Laroque, C. P.","Aim Recent and rapid warming is reorganizing terrestrial vegetation, creating novel species assemblages, and shifting range limits. Relative to the evergreen species that currently dominate much of the boreal forest landscape, Larix (larch) distributions may be particularly responsive to climatic change due to their deciduous habit, and quick growth and reproduction. Here, we amassed data from 83 studies to describe and explain observed patterns of Larix range shifts under contemporary climate change. Location Northern hemisphere. Taxon Species of the genus Larix, deciduous gymnosperms. Methods With 181 observations of Larix range limit dynamics, we used five distribution parameters (tree line advance, stand infilling, tree line recession, stand thinning, no response) and their determinants (climate, land use change, natural disturbance) to describe and explain observed patterns of Larix range shifts under contemporary climate change. We ran a redundancy analysis on the matrix of five distribution parameters considered with other climatic and nonclimatic parameters as explanatory variables. We also characterized the climatic niche of Larix species (temperature and precipitation) and how the niche has changed during the 20th century. Results Of 173 sites studied over the full distribution of Larix, 63% experienced Larix population increases, 18% had population decreases, and no response was detected at 19% of sites. Latitudinal Larix tree lines in Siberia and North America appear to be infilling and shifting their distributions northward, whereas Larix recession and thinning was more common in southern regions, suggesting southern populations may be experiencing greater drought stress than their northern counterparts. Climatic niches of most Larix species shifted towards warmer and wetter conditions, with tree line advance/forest infilling in cool/dry climate space, and recession/thinning in warm/dry space. Main conclusions Northern expansion is underway or seems imminent for boreal Larix species, primarily L. laricina in North America. Retraction in southern regions and disappearance of some mountainous populations may be inevitable due to their narrow ecological niches. Species restricted to mountainous habitats may expand locally, though will likely not contribute to broad scale range expansion. These changes will depend on suitable climate, disturbance, and dispersal mechanisms.",2019,"JAN","Journal of Biogeography","46","1","30-44","WOS:000456346000003","10.1111/jbi.13465","","#7705","Mamet 2019","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"202","Conservation of Northwestern and Southwestern Pond Turtles: Threats, Population Size Estimates, and Population Viability Analysis","Manzo, S.; Nicholson, E. G.; Devereux, Z.; Fisher, R. N.; Brown, C. W.; Scott, P. A.; Shaffer, H. B.","Accurate status assessments of long-lived, widely distributed taxa depend on the availability of long-term monitoring data from multiple populations. However, monitoring populations across large temporal and spatial scales is often beyond the scope of any one researcher or research group. Consequently, wildlife managers may be tasked with utilizing limited information from different sources to detect range-wide evidence of population declines and their causes. When assessments need to be made under such constraints, the research and management communities must determine how to extrapolate from variable population data to species-level inferences. Here, using three different approaches, we integrate and analyze data from the peer-reviewed literature and government agency reports to inform conservation for northwestern pond turtles (NPT) Actinemys marmorata and southwestern pond turtles (SPT) Actinemys pallida. Both NPT and SPT are long-lived freshwater turtles distributed along the west coast of the United States and Mexico. Conservation concerns exist for both species; however, SPT may face more severe threats and are thought to exist at lower densities throughout their range than NPT. For each species, we ranked the impacts of 13 potential threats, estimated population sizes, and modeled population viability with and without long-term droughts. Our results suggest that predation of hatchlings by invasive predators, such as American bullfrogs Lithobates catesbeianus and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, is a high-ranking threat for NPT and SPT. Southwestern pond turtles may also face more severe impacts associated with natural disasters (droughts, wildfires, and floods) than do NPT. Population size estimates from trapping surveys indicate that SPT have smaller population sizes on average than do NPT (P = 0.0003), suggesting they may be at greater risk of local extirpation. Population viability analysis models revealed that long-term droughts are a key environmental parameter; as the frequency of severe droughts increases with climate change, the likelihood of population recovery decreases, especially when census sizes are low. Given current population trends and vulnerability to natural disasters throughout their range, we suggest that conservation and recovery actions first focus on SPT to prevent further population declines.",2021,"DEC","JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT","12","2","485-501","WOS:000728017600007","10.3996/JFWM-20-094","","#7752","Manzo 2021","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The nature of interventions for displaced populations itself influences food security in hosting areas, and recent debates over refugee assistance have indicated some ways in which existing practice can be counterproductive. The recognition that environmental change can be associated with forced migration has made an important contribution to debates over who should be the legitimate beneficiaries of international relief, but the term 'environmental refugee' is misleading conceptually and is legally and institutionally unfounded.

A.; Derksen, C.","Understanding the processes driving terrestrial vegetation productivity dynamics in boreal ecosystems is critical for accurate assessments of carbon dynamics. Monitoring these dynamics typically requires a fusion of broad-scale remote sensing observations, climate information and other geospatial data inputs, which often have unknown errors, are difficult to obtain, or limit spatial and temporal resolutions of productivity estimates. The past decade has seen notable advances in technologies and the diversity of observed wavelengths from remote sensing instruments, offering new insights on vegetation carbon dynamics. In this communication, we review key current approaches for modeling terrestrial vegetation productivity, followed by a discussion on new remote sensing instruments and derived products including Sentinel-3 Land Surface Temperature, freeze & thaw state from the Soil Moisture & Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, and soil moisture from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. We outline how these products can improve the spatial detail and temporal representation of boreal productivity estimates driven entirely by a fusion of remote sensing observations. We conclude with a demonstration of how these different elements can be integrated across key land cover types in the Hudson plains, an extensive wetland-dominated region of the Canadian boreal, and provide recommendations for future model development.

"208","Kelp distribution in the northwest Atlantic Ocean under a changing climate","Merzouk, A.; Johnson, L. E.","Warming of the planet has accelerated in recent years and is predicted to continue over the next century. Environmental consequences include increasing water temperatures, and evidence of ecological responses to current warming in marine coastal ecosystems is found in poleward shifts in the geographic range of species as well as changes in the composition of nearshore benthic communities. Most evidence has, however, been obtained from intertidal studies, but similar shifts should be occurring for subtidal communities as well, especially for the ecologically important kelp species that provide both food and shelter to a multitude of organisms. Kelp may be particularly vulnerable to climate change due to their cold-water affinities and limited dispersal ability. A major biogeographic transition occurs along northwest Atlantic shores of Canada between subarctic and boreal zones where major shifts can be seen in the composition of kelp assemblages of Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata, Saccharina longicruris and Saccharina latissima. Here we review the historic and recent distribution and abundance of these species and find no evidence of changes in the past century. However, sparse coverage of data, inconsistent methodology and a lack of adequate time series prevent us from concluding that no changes have occurred, especially with respect to natural variation and anthropogenic alteration. These shortcomings illustrate the need for identifying sentinel species and sites for studies dedicated to the specific questions of climate-induced changes in kelp abundance and distribution. We suggest that a combination of traditional and modern tools (e.g., benthic surveys and climate model forecasting, respectively) offers the best path forward.

Climate-induced changes must be assessed in the context of massive anthropogenic changes in water quantity and quality resulting from altered patterns of land use, water withdrawal, and species invasions; these may dwarf or exacerbate climate-induced changes. Water to meet instream needs is competing with other uses of water, and that competition is likely to be increased by climate change. We review recent predictions of the impacts of climate change on aquatic ecosystems in eight regions of North America. Impacts include warmer temperatures that alter lake mixing regimes and availability of fish habitat; changed magnitude and seasonality of runoff regimes that alter nutrient loading and limit habitat availability at low flow; and loss of prairie pothole wetlands that reduces waterfowl populations. Many of the predicted changes in aquatic ecosystems are a consequence of climatic effects on terrestrial ecosystems; shifts in riparian vegetation and hydrology are particularly critical. We review models that could be used to explore potential effects of climate change on freshwater ecosystems; these include models of instream flow, bioenergetics models, nutrient spiraling models, and models relating riverine food webs to hydrologic regime.

Despite substantial improvement in understanding the species, major questions remain about their recruitment, offshore behaviors, captive rearing, and management. Recently, southern flounder have also been in focus because of substantial synchronous population declines throughout their range with specific concerns that recruitment failure and possibly climate change may be implicated. Management of southern flounder has thus far taken place within individual states, but coming into focus is the possibility that larger coastwide management approaches may need to be considered due to both the migratory nature of the species and the possibility of population stressors acting at regional scales.

Although effective antifouling paints incorporating organotins have considerably reduced fouling biomass these paints have a limited period of effectiveness, which may be less than the ships' inter-docking period, depending on sea temperature and abrasion. Vessels immersed over several years can allow fouling communities to develop and spread beyond their native distribution. This process of establishment is not fully understood. This review proposes that short rapid turnaround of vessels with mature attached biota can result in synchronized spawnings and production of sufficient zygotes to form a founder population. Spawning may be induced by changes in temperature or salinity on entry into a port, according to season. The diversity of taxa. in transit on ships' hulls includes commercial molluscs, which have the potential to transmit their diseases or pests to port regions. Several factors may act in the further enhancement of exotic species establishment including changes of in-port berthing regions to more marine conditions. Ships today are generally larger, and faster, and have a high frequency of port visits thereby increasing the number of spawning opportunities, perhaps with a larger inoculum size. With trade expansion, new trading routes, political events and changes in climate, new pathways for invasion will emerge. Greater controls on industrial discharges, improved treatments of urban wastes and better management of waste runoff into rivers as well as a phasing out of organotin antifoulants will mean a reduced toxicity in port regions. This may enable a smaller inoculum to colonize by creating opportunities for establishment not present in the previous 25 years.

It is a complex process, and drought tolerance response is carried out by various genes, transcription factors, microRNAs, hormones, proteins, co-factors, ions and metabolites. This complexity has limited the development of crop cultivars for drought tolerance. Breeding for drought tolerance is further complicated because several types of abiotic stress, such as high temperatures, high irradiance, and nutrient toxicities or deficiencies, can challenge crop plants simultaneously. Although marker-assisted selection is now widely deployed in wheat, it has not contributed significantly to cultivar improvement for adaptation to low-yielding environments, and breeding has relied largely on direct phenotypic selection for improved performance in these difficult environments. Advances in plant breeding to produce improved and higher performing wheat cultivars are key to making dryland food-production systems more efficient and more resistant to pressure from drought, extremes of cold and heat, unpredictable rainfall, and new pests and diseases. For optimal performance, wheat cultivars can be targeted to specific farming systems, depending on local conditions and stresses. Genetic gain in wheat yield potential during the last century has been achieved by plant breeding and is well documented. It has been studied by comparing, in the same field trial, the yield of cultivars characterised by different years of release. Genomic selection (GS) and high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) have attracted the interest of plant breeders, and both approaches promise to revolutionise the prediction of complex traits, including growth, yield and adaptation to stress. This review describes the impact of drought on yield, trends in yield for boosting crop yields to meet the projected demands of rising global population by 2050, and genetic gain achieved by plant breeding in the last decades; and gathers known functional information on the genes, metabolites and traits and their direct involvement in conferring drought tolerance in wheat.

This synthesis of empirical and modeling studies includes tree DNA evidence suggesting tree migrations since the last glaciation were much slower, at least under postglacial conditions, than is needed to keep up with current and future climate warming. Exceedances of US and Canadian ozone air quality standards are apparent and offset CO2-induced gains in biomass and predispose trees to other stresses. The deposition of nitrogen and sulfate in the northeastern United States changes forest nutrient availability and retention, reduces reproductive success and frost hardiness, causes physical damage to leaf surfaces, and alters performance of forest pests and diseases. These interacting stresses may increase future tree declines and ecosystem disturbances during transition to a warmer climate. Recent modeling work predicts warmer climates will increase suitable habitat (not necessarily actual distribution) for most tree species in the northeastern United States.

"215","A new paradigm of water, food, and energy nexus","Molajou, A.; Afshar, A.; Khosravi, M.; Soleimanian, E.; Vahabzadeh, M.; Variani, H. A.","In recent decades, global forecasts show that the demands for freshwater, energy, and food have been affected by population growth, economic development, international trade, and increasing urbanization and food diversity. Moreover, cultural changes and other phenomena have adversely affected the water, energy, and food (WEF) resources demand. Consequently, climate change adverse impact, which is an undesirable phenomenon, will be increased at a staggering rate. Numerous studies have emphasized that the lack of integrated and systematic management strategies threaten these indispensable resources' ability to meet growing demand. In many countries, the security of WEF resources, which is related to each other, has become three non-traditional security challenges that overshadow these communities' development. Before realizing the importance of interactions between these three vital resources, the management strategies were typically used for one source, which was completely independent of the other two. Since these strategies did not consider the interactions between the three systems, the applied strategies' results were sometimes contradictory. Also, due to the lack of attention to these three sectors' vital connections, the competition level among these systems has been increased. Therefore, in recent years, the study of the complex interactions and connections between these resources has led to the emergence of a new term called WEF nexus in the scientific communities.

There is strong evidence that thinning, particularly heavy thinning, reduces the impact of drought and also the risk and severity of fire when harvest slash is burned or removed. Thinning also increases the growth and vigor of residual trees, making them less susceptible to eruptive insects and pathogens, while targeted removal of host species, susceptible individuals and infected trees can slow the spread of outbreaks. However, the evidence that thinning has consistent positive effects is limited to a few insects and pathogens, and negative effects on root rot infection severity were also reported. At this point, our review reveals insufficient evidence from rigorous experiments to draw general conclusions. Although thinning initially increases the risk of windthrow, there is good evidence that thinning young stands reduces the long-term risk by promoting the development of structural roots and favouring the acclimation of trees to high wind loads. While our review suggests that thinning should not be promoted as a tool that will universally increase the resistance and resilience of forests, current evidence suggests that thinning could still be an effective tool to reduce forest vulnerability to several stressors, creating a window of opportunity to implement longer term adaptive management strategies such as assisted migration. We highlight knowledge gaps that should be targeted by future research to assess the potential contribution of thinning to adaptive forest management. One of these gaps is that studies from boreal and tropical regions are drastically underrepresented, with almost no studies conducted in Asia and the southern hemisphere.

The ecology of the virus is driven by numerous factors, including climate and avian migration patterns, yet relatively little is known about these drivers. Long-distance transport of the virus is tied to inter- and intra-continental bird migration, while enhanced viral reassortment is linked to breeding habitats in Beringia shared by migrant species from North America and Asia. Furthermore, water temperature, pH, salinity, and co-existing biota all impact the viability and persistence of the virus in the environment. Changes in climate can potentially alter the ecology of AIV through multiple pathways. Warming temperatures can change the timing and patterns of bird migration, creating novel assemblages of species and new opportunities for viral transport and reassortment. Water temperature and chemistry may also be altered, resulting in changes in virus survival. In this review, we explain how these shifts have the potential to increase viral persistence, pathogenicity, and transmissibility and amplify the threat of pandemic disease in animal and human hosts.

W.","Hydrological and carbon cycles are inherently coupled and play a pivotal role in the earth system. Water stress is one of the most limiting factors constraining vegetation productivity in both direct and indirect ways (mainly through nutrition cycling). In this article, we first reviewed the concepts of hydrological and carbon cycles and their interactions and then summarized recent advances in our understanding of how global climate change affects water stress, ecosystem carbon cycling, disturbances, and water use efficiency. A warming climate may continue to benefit plant growth in energy limited areas such as high latitudes and altitudes. However, over many water-limited regions of the world, a warming climate has led to a drying trend, posing negative effects on land carbon sink capability, as shown by reductions in vegetation growth and increases in ecosystem disturbances (wildfires, insect outbreaks, and tree mortality). Carbon cycle and water use efficiency have responded to climate change in different ways in different areas. Further integrating information from climate records, flux measurements at eddy flux towers, and observations from satellites will greatly advance our understanding of the hydrological and carbon cycles and their evolution.

Environmental and land-use change is increasingly compromising access to, availability of, and consumption of berries. In this review, I consider (a) how climate and land-use change are impacting cultural use berries across species and places, as documented by Indigenous Peoples and in the scientific literature, and (b) how stewardship practices are being applied to promote resilience and sustainability in berrying landscapes experiencing stress. Climate impacts on Arctic and subarctic berry species include earlier ripening, changes in taste, or increased variability in abundance. These same regions are experiencing a proliferation of shrubs, while forests throughout the lower 48 and Canada are suffering from suffocating fuel loads and stand densities that are not conducive to berry habitat for many species. In the Pacific West, berries are influenced by prolonged droughts and increasing spring and summer temperatures. Climate change impacts are amplified by shifts in land use for forestry and agriculture. Biocultural stewardship practices, like low-intensity fire, thinning, transplanting, and cultural care, can be used to mitigate these impacts and promote berry microclimate habitats.

A.","Bronze birch borer (Agrilus anxius Gory) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), a specialist wood-borer endemic to North America, is prone to periodic outbreaks that have caused widespread mortality of birch (Betula spp.) in boreal and north temperate forests. It is also the key pest of birch in ornamental landscapes. Amenity plantings have extended the distribution of birch in North America, for which we report an updated map. Life history and phenology also are summarized. Larvae feed primarily on phloem tissue of stems and branches, which can girdle and kill trees. Stressors such as drought, elevated temperature, and defoliation predispose trees to bronze birch borer colonization and trigger outbreaks, which implicates the availability of suitable host material in the bottom-up regulation of populations. Stress imposed by climate change may increase the frequency of outbreaks and alter the distribution of birch. Bronze birch borer has a diverse array of natural enemies, but their role in top-down population regulation has not been studied. There is substantial interspecific variation in resistance to this insect. North American species share a coevolutionary history with bronze birch borer and are much more resistant than Eurasian species, which are evolutionarily naive. Potential resistance mechanisms are reviewed. The high susceptibility of Eurasian birch species and climatic similarities of North America and Eurasia create high risk of widespread birch mortality in Eurasia if the borer was inadvertently introduced.

Our findings indicate significant variability in this relationship across different scales of farming operations, including large, medium, small, and landless farmers. We also identify several local contextual factors-such as access to credit, social structures, social fractionalization, conflicts, and migrant networks- that intricately influence this association. Our review departs from previous literature by providing a unique theoretical perspective on the diverse evidence surrounding migration and climate change. We propose a conceptual framework to better understand migration responses in less-developed countries and pinpoint policy gaps that limit agricultural households' ability to adapt to climate change.

B.","Over the past century, two introduced Eurasian trees, saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) have become wide spread on western United States of American (U. S.) rivers. This paper reviews the literature on the following five key areas related to their distribution and abundance in the western United States: (1) the history of introduction, planting, and spread of saltcedar and Russian olive; (2) their current distribution; (3) their current abundance; (4) factors controlling their current distribution and abundance; and (5) models that have been developed to predict their future distribution and abundance. Saltcedar and Russian olive are now the third and fourth most frequently occurring woody riparian plants and the second and fifth most abundant species (out of 42 native and non-native species) along rivers in the western United States. Currently there is not a precise estimate of the areas that these species occupy in the entire West. Climatic variables are important determinants of their distribution and abundance. For example, saltcedar is limited by its sensitivity to hard freezes, whereas Russian olive appears to have a chilling requirement for bud break and seed germination, and can presumably survive colder winter temperatures. Either species can be dominant, co-dominant or sub-dominant relative to native species on a given river system. A number of environmental factors such as water availability, soil salinity, degree of streamflow regulation, and fire frequency can influence the abundance of these species relative to native species. Numerous studies suggest that both species have spread on western rivers primarily through a replacement process, whereby stress-tolerant species have moved into expanded niches that are no longer suitable for mesic native pioneer species. Better maps of current distribution and rigorous monitoring of distributional changes though time can help to resolve differences in predictions of potential future spread. An adequate understanding does not yet exist of what fraction of western riparian zones is resistant to dominance by either of these species, what fraction is at risk and could benefit from intervention, and what fraction has been altered to the point that saltcedar or Russian olive are most likely to thrive.",2011,"","Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences","30","6","508-523","WOS:000298323800002","10.1080/07352689.2011.615689","","#8687","Nagler 2011","Colleen Miller (2024-08-29 04:00:20)(Select): discuss invasion of Canada of Russian olive (presumably from US);","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

P.; Erickson, T.","Introduction Climate change has been scientifically documented, and its effects on wildlife have been prognosticated. We sought to predict the overall impact of climate change on venomous terrestrial species. We hypothesize that given the close relationship between terrestrial venomous species and climate, a changing global environment may result in increased species migration, geographical redistribution, and longer seasons for envenomation, which would have repercussions on human health. Methods A retrospective analysis of environmental, ecological, and medical literature was performed with a focus on climate change, toxinology, and future modeling specific to venomous terrestrial creatures. Species included venomous reptiles, snakes, arthropods, spiders, and Hymenoptera (ants and bees). Animals that are vectors of hemorrhagic infectious disease (eg, mosquitos, ticks) were excluded. Results Our review of the literature indicates that changes to climatic norms will have a potentially dramatic effect on terrestrial venomous creatures. Empirical evidence demonstrates that geographic distributions of many species have already shifted due to changing climatic conditions. Given that most terrestrial venomous species are ectotherms closely tied to ambient temperature, and that climate change is shifting temperature zones away from the equator, further significant distribution and population changes should be anticipated. For those species able to migrate to match the changing temperatures, new geographical locations may open. For those species with limited distribution capabilities, the rate of climate change may accelerate faster than species can adapt, causing population declines. Specifically, poisonous snakes and spiders will likely maintain their population numbers but will shift their geographic distribution to traditionally temperate zones more often inhabited by humans. Fire ants and Africanized honey bees are expected to have an expanded range distribution due to predicted warming trends. Human encounters with these types of creatures are likely to increase, resulting in potential human morbidity and mortality. Conclusions Temperature extremes and changes to climatic norms may have a dramatic effect on venomous terrestrial species.

E.","In the warming Arctic, aquatic habitats are in flux and salmon are exploring their options. Adult Pacific salmon, including sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), coho (O. kisutch), Chinook (O. tshawytscha), pink (O. gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) have been captured throughout the Arctic. Pink and chum salmon are the most common species found in the Arctic today. These species are less dependent on freshwater habitats as juveniles and grow quickly in marine habitats. Putative spawning populations are rare in the North American Arctic and limited to pink salmon in drainages north of Point Hope, Alaska, chum salmon spawning rivers draining to the northwestern Beaufort Sea, and small populations of chum and pink salmon in Canada's Mackenzie River. Pacific salmon have colonized several large river basins draining to the Kara, Laptev and East Siberian seas in the Russian Arctic. These populations probably developed from hatchery supplementation efforts in the 1960's. Hundreds of populations of Arctic Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are found in Russia, Norway and Finland. Atlantic salmon have extended their range eastward as far as the Kara Sea in central Russian. A small native population of Atlantic salmon is found in Canada's Ungava Bay. The northern tip of Quebec seems to be an Atlantic salmon migration barrier for other North American stocks. Compatibility between life history requirements and ecological conditions are prerequisite for salmon colonizing Arctic habitats. Broad-scale predictive models of climate change in the Arctic give little information about feedback processes contributing to local conditions, especially in freshwater systems.

A.","Altered precipitation patterns resulting from climate change will have particularly significant consequences in water-limited ecosystems, such as arid to semi-arid ecosystems, where discontinuous inputs of water control biological processes. Given that these ecosystems cover more than a third of Earth's terrestrial surface, it is important to understand how they respond to such alterations. Altered water availability may impact both aboveground and belowground communities and the interactions between these, with potential impacts on ecosystem functioning; however, most studies to date have focused exclusively on vegetation responses to altered precipitation regimes. To synthesize our understanding of potential climate change impacts on dryland ecosystems, we present here a review of current literature that reports the effects of precipitation events and altered precipitation regimes on belowground biota and biogeochemical cycling. Increased precipitation generally increases microbial biomass and fungal:bacterial ratio. Few studies report responses to reduced precipitation but the effects likely counter those of increased precipitation. Altered precipitation regimes have also been found to alter microbial community composition but broader generalizations are difficult to make. Changes in event size and frequency influences invertebrate activity and density with cascading impacts on the soil food web, which will likely impact carbon and nutrient pools. The long-term implications for biogeochemical cycling are inconclusive but several studies suggest that increased aridity may cause decoupling of carbon and nutrient cycling. We propose a new conceptual framework that incorporates hierarchical biotic responses to individual precipitation events more explicitly, including moderation of microbial activity and biomass by invertebrate grazing, and use this framework to make some predictions on impacts of altered precipitation regimes in terms of event size and frequency as well as mean annual precipitation. While our understanding of dryland ecosystems is improving, there is still a great need for longer term in situ manipulations of precipitation regime to test our model.",2015,"APR","Global Change Biology","21","4","1407-1421","WOS:000351214100006","10.1111/gcb.12789","","#8874","Nielsen 2015","","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"226","The role of hydrochory in structuring riparian and wetland vegetation","Nilsson, C.; Brown, R. L.; Jansson, R.; Merritt, D. M.","Hydrochory, or the passive dispersal of organisms by water, is an important means of propagule transport, especially for plants. During recent years, knowledge about hydrochory and its ecological consequences has increased considerably and a substantial body of literature has been produced. Here, we review this literature and define the state of the art of the discipline. A substantial proportion of species growing in or near water have propagules (fruits, seeds or vegetative units) able to disperse by water, either floating, submerged in flowing water, or with the help of floating vessels. Hydrochory can enable plants to colonize sites out of reach with other dispersal vectors, but the timing of dispersal and mechanisms of establishment are important for successful establishment. At the population level, hydrochory may increase the effective size and longevity of populations, and control their spatial configuration. Hydrochory is also an important source of species colonizing recruitment-limited riparian and wetland communities, contributing to maintenance of community species richness. Dispersal by water may even influence community composition in different landscape elements, resulting in landscape-level patterns. Genetically, hydrochory may reduce spatial aggregation of genetically related individuals, lead to high gene flow among populations, and increase genetic diversity in populations receiving many propagules. Humans have impacted hydrochory in many ways. For example, dams affect hydrochory by reducing peak flows and hence dispersal capacity, altering the timing of dispersal, and by presenting physical barriers to dispersal, with consequences for riverine plant communities. Hydrochory has been inferred to be an important vector for the spread of many invasive species, but there is also the potential for enhancing ecosystem restoration by improving or restoring water dispersal pathways. Climate change may alter the role of hydrochory by modifying the hydrology of water-bodies as well as conditions for propagule release and plant colonization.",2010,"NOV","Biological Reviews","85","4","837-858","WOS:000282880900009","10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00129.x","","#8887","Nilsson 2010","","Biophysical; Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

M.","The New England - Acadian Forest (NEAF) is an ecoregion spanning 24 million hectares of the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. The region is characterized as a transitional forest naturally composed of both boreal and temperate species. The term """"borealization"""" is sometimes used to describe various processes driving the NEAF toward a more boreal character at the expense of its temperate forest species and ecological communities. That the NEAF has undergone significant landscape-scale change in the last four centuries since European settlement is well understood. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the literature on the forest composition and dynamics of this region to investigate whether past, current, and (or) predicted future processes of change are indeed driving the forest toward a more boreal character. We examine studies on the historical forest composition and impacts of past and current land-use practices, as well as indirect anthropogenic changes that are predicted to influence future forest compositions of the NEAF. We review over 100 peer-reviewed scientific journal articles and government reports related to this issue. We find ample evidence to suggest that, at the landscape scale, there has been widespread replacement of temperate tree species by boreal species since European settlement. Five primary drivers have facilitated borealization across the NEAF: logging and high-grading, natural reforestation of abandoned farmland, industrial clearcutting, anthropogenic fire, and boreal conifer plantations. Furthermore, the borealization of the NEAF has continued to occur in direct contrast to the predicted impacts of climate change.

N.; Levin, E. D.","Climate change induced by anthropogenic warming of the earth's atmosphere is a daunting problem. This review examines one of the consequences of climate change that has only recently attracted attention: namely, the effects of climate change on the environmental distribution and toxicity of chemical pollutants. A review was undertaken of the scientific literature (original research articles, reviews, government and intergovernmental reports) focusing on the interactions of toxicants with the environmental parameters, temperature, precipitation, and salinity, as altered by climate change. Three broad classes of chemical toxicants of global significance were the focus: air pollutants, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including some organochlorine pesticides, and other classes of pesticides. Generally, increases in temperature will enhance the toxicity of contaminants and increase concentrations of tropospheric ozone regionally, but will also likely increase rates of chemical degradation. While further research is needed, climate change coupled with air pollutant exposures may have potentially serious adverse consequences for human health in urban and polluted regions. Climate change producing alterations in: food webs, lipid dynamics. ice and snow melt, and organic carbon cycling could result in increased POP levels in water, soil, and biota. There is also compelling evidence that increasing temperatures could be deleterious to pollutant-exposed wildlife. For example, elevated water temperatures may alter the biotransformation of contaminants to more bioactive metabolites and impair homeostasis. The complex interactions between climate change and pollutants may be particularly problematic for species living at the edge of their physiological tolerance range where acclimation capacity may be limited. In addition to temperature increases, regional precipitation patterns are projected to be altered with climate change. Regions subject to decreases in precipitation may experience enhanced volatilization of POPs and pesticides to the atmosphere. Reduced precipitation will also increase air pollution in urbanized regions resulting in negative health effects, which may be exacerbated by temperature increases. Regions subject to increased precipitation will have lower levels of air pollution, but will likely experience enhanced surface deposition of airborne POPs and increased run-off of pesticides. Moreover, increases in the intensity and frequency of storm events linked to climate change could lead to more severe episodes of chemical contamination of water bodies and surrounding watersheds. Changes in salinity may affect aquatic organisms as an independent stressor as well as by altering the bioavailability and in some instances increasing the toxicity of chemicals. A paramount issue will be to identify species and populations especially vulnerable to climate-pollutant interactions, in the context of the many other physical, chemical, and biological stressors that will be altered with climate change. Moreover, it will be important to predict tipping points that might trigger or accelerate synergistic interactions between climate change and contaminant exposures, (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2009,"AUG","Environment International","35","6","971-986","WOS:000267415500020","10.1016/j.envint.2009.02.006","","#8955","Noyes 2009","","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of the southeastern United States, the frequency and intensity of extreme freeze events greatly influence whether coastal wetlands are dominated by freeze-sensitive woody plants (mangrove forests) or freeze-tolerant grass-like plants (salt marshes). In response to warming winters, mangroves have been expanding and displacing salt marshes at varying degrees of severity in parts of north Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. As winter warming accelerates, mangrove range expansion is expected to increasingly modify wetland ecosystem structure and function. Because there are differences in the ecological and societal benefits that salt marshes and mangroves provide, coastal environmental managers are challenged to anticipate the effects of mangrove expansion on critical wetland ecosystem services, including those related to carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, storm protection, erosion reduction, water purification, fisheries support, and recreation. Mangrove range expansion may also affect wetland stability in the face of extreme climatic events and rising sea levels. Here, we review the current understanding of the effects of mangrove range expansion and displacement of salt marshes on wetland ecosystem services in the southeastern United States. We also identify critical knowledge gaps and emerging research needs regarding the ecological and societal implications of salt marsh displacement by expanding mangrove forests. One consistent theme throughout our review is that there are ecological trade-offs for consideration by coastal managers. Mangrove expansion and marsh displacement can produce beneficial changes in some ecosystem services, while simultaneously producing detrimental changes in other services. Thus, there can be local-scale differences in perceptions of the impacts of mangrove expansion into salt marshes. For very specific local reasons, some individuals may see mangrove expansion as a positive change to be embraced, while others may see mangrove expansion as a negative change to be constrained.",2022,"MAY","Global Change Biology","28","10","3163-3187","WOS:000756328500001","10.1111/gcb.16111","","#9144","Osland 2022","Anna LoPresti (2024-10-16 05:25:27)(Select): maps in the paper show range expansion from mexico into south Texas, so considering this to be transboundary; Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-15 12:57:29)(Select): Range shifts are very close to the US-Mexico border, interesting insights can be gleaned; ","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"231","Climate change and <i>Ixodes</i> tick-borne diseases of humans","Ostfeld, R. S.; Brunner, J. L.","The evidence that climate warming is changing the distribution of Ixodes ticks and the pathogens they transmit is reviewed and evaluated. The primary approaches are either phenomenological, which typically assume that climate alone limits current and future distributions, or mechanistic, asking which tick-demographic parameters are affected by specific abiotic conditions. Both approaches have promise but are severely limited when applied separately. For instance, phenomenological approaches (e.g. climate envelope models) often select abiotic variables arbitrarily and produce results that can be hard to interpret biologically. On the other hand, although laboratory studies demonstrate strict temperature and humidity thresholds for tick survival, these limits rarely apply to field situations. Similarly, no studies address the influence of abiotic conditions on more than a few life stages, transitions or demographic processes, preventing comprehensive assessments. Nevertheless, despite their divergent approaches, both mechanistic and phenomenological models suggest dramatic range expansions of Ixodes ticks and tick-borne disease as the climate warms. The predicted distributions, however, vary strongly with the models' assumptions, which are rarely tested against reasonable alternatives. These inconsistencies, limited data about key tick-demographic and climatic processes and only limited incorporation of non-climatic processes have weakened the application of this rich area of research to public health policy or actions. We urge further investigation of the influence of climate on vertebrate hosts and tick-borne pathogen dynamics. In addition, testing model assumptions and mechanisms in a range of natural contexts and comparing their relative importance as competing models in a rigorous statistical framework will significantly advance our understanding of how climate change will alter the distribution, dynamics and risk of tick-borne disease.",2015,"APR 5","PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","370","1665","","WOS:000350829800011","10.1098/rstb.2014.0051","","#9153","Ostfeld 2015","","Biotic; Perspective paper; Potentially relevant; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"232","The genic view of hybridization in the Anthropocene","Ottenburghs, J.","Human impact is noticeable around the globe, indicating that a new era might have begun: the Anthropocene. Continuing human activities, including land-use changes, introduction of non-native species and rapid climate change, are altering the distributions of countless species, often giving rise to human-mediated hybridization events. While the interbreeding of different populations or species can have detrimental effects, such as genetic extinction, it can be beneficial in terms of adaptive introgression or an increase in genetic diversity. In this paper, I first review the different mechanisms and outcomes of anthropogenic hybridization based on literature from the last five years (2016-2020). The most common mechanisms leading to the interbreeding of previously isolated taxa include habitat change (51% of the studies) and introduction of non-native species (34% intentional and 19% unintentional). These human-induced hybridization events most often result in introgression (80%). The high incidence of genetic exchange between the hybridizing taxa indicates that the application of a genic view of speciation (and introgression) can provide crucial insights on how to address hybridization events in the Anthropocene. This perspective considers the genome as a dynamic collection of genetic loci with distinct evolutionary histories, giving rise to a heterogenous genomic landscape in terms of genetic differentiation and introgression. First, understanding this genomic landscape can lead to a better selection of diagnostic genetic markers to characterize hybrid populations. Second, describing how introgression patterns vary across the genome can help to predict the likelihood of negative processes, such as demographic and genetic swamping, as well as positive outcomes, such as adaptive introgression. It is especially important to not only quantify how much genetic material introgressed, but also what has been exchanged. Third, comparing introgression patterns in pre-Anthropocene hybridization events with current human-induced cases might provide novel insights into the likelihood of genetic swamping or species collapse during an anthropogenic hybridization event. However, this comparative approach remains to be tested before it can be applied in practice. Finally, the genic view of introgression can be combined with conservation genomic studies to determine the legal status of hybrids and take appropriate measures to manage anthropogenic hybridization events. The interplay between evolutionary and conservation genomics will result in the constant exchange of ideas between these fields which will not only improve our knowledge on the origin of species, but also how to conserve and protect them.",2021,"OCT","Evolutionary Applications","14","10","2342-2360","WOS:000632950600001","10.1111/eva.13223","","#9172","Ottenburghs 2021","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"233","Resolving Future Arctic/Midlatitude Weather Connections","Overland, J. E.; Wang, M. Y.","Given ongoing large changes in the Arctic, high-latitude forcing is a new potential driver for sub-seasonal weather impacts at midlatitudes in coming decades. Such linkage research, however, is controversial. Some metrics find supporting evidence and others report no robust correlations. Model studies reach different conclusions. Case studies from particular historical months suggest potential connections. We propose that a difficulty in resolving the science is due to the inherent complexity and intermittent character of atmospheric dynamics, which serves as a variable causal bridge between changes in the Arctic and midlatitude weather. Linkages may be more favorable in one atmospheric jet stream pattern than another. Linkages are a two-step process: thermodynamic forcing, i.e. warm Arctic temperatures and loss of sea ice, is generally favorable in the last decade, but internal atmospheric dynamics, i.e. the jet stream location and strength, must also allow for a connection. Thus, in the last decade only a few possible linkage events are noted into and out of the Arctic; for examples 2006, 2016, and 2018 had warm Arctic Januaries, and 2010 and 2017 had cold eastern North American Decembers. Record large sea-ice-free areas and warm temperatures north of Alaska and over Baffin Bay helped to anchor the long wave atmospheric pattern, which in turn fed cold temperatures into the eastern US. Intra-seasonal and inter-annual intermittency explains low direct Arctic/midlatitude linkage correlations and large variability in model studies.

E.","Over the past several decades, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in inland natural water systems has been a popular research topic to a variety of scientific disciplines. Part of the attention has been due to observed changes in DOC concentrations in many of the water systems of the Northern Hemisphere. Shifts in DOC levels, and changes in its composition, are of concern due to its significance in aquatic ecosystem functioning and its potential and realized negative effects on waters that might be treated for drinking purposes. While it may not be possible to establish sound cause and effect relationships using a limited number of drivers, through long-term DOC monitoring studies and a variety of laboratory/field experiments, several explanations for increasing DOC trends have been proposed, including two key mechanisms: decreased atmospheric acid deposition and the increasing impact of climate change agents. The purpose of this review is three-fold: to outline frequently discussed conceptual mechanisms used to explain DOC increases (especially under a changing climate), to discuss the structure of DOC and the impact of higher levels of DOC on drinking water resources, and to provide renewed/sustained interest in DOC research that can encourage interdisciplinary collaboration. Understanding the cycling of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems into natural waters is necessary in the face of a variable and changing climate, as climate change-related mechanisms may become increasingly responsible for variations in the inputs of allochthonous DOC concentrations in water.",2014,"OCT","Water","6","10","2862-2897","WOS:000344358200002","10.3390/w6102862","","#9226","Pagano 2014","","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

However, declining genetic diversity of traditional food crops and high vulnerability to climate change are major impediments for maintaining agricultural productivity. Limited initiatives to achieve food self-sufficiency and utilization of Plant Genetic Resources (PGR) for enhancing resilience of agro-ecosystems are other serious constraints. This review focuses on the visible and anticipated impacts of climate ge, on major food and tree crops in agriculture and agroforestry systems in the PICs. We argue that crop improvement through plant breeding is a viable strategy to enhance food security and climatic resilience in the region. The exploitation of adaptive traits: abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, yield and nutritional efficiency, is imperative in a world threatened by climatic extremes. However, the insular constraints of Fiji and other small PICs are major limitations for the utilization of PGR through high throughput techniques which are also cost prohibitive.

L.","As greenhouse gas emissions rise unabated and temperatures continue to rise, forest managers have begun to consider assisted migration (AM) of trees as a strategy to adapt forests to climate change. To investigate the risks and benefits of AM, old provenance trials have been repurposed and new common-garden experiments initiated. In this paper, we review three decades of common-garden based research into the adaptation of species and provenances (geographically specific varieties) to current and future climates in North America. Using a filtered data base of 106 papers and reports, we investigate multiple aspects of this work, including subject species, tree response variables and their climatic predictors, statistical techniques, and the patterns of adaptation revealed in results. Although the reviewed work contained valuable insights into provenance-climate relationships, much of this work focused on growth in commercial conifer species and the correlation of that growth with annual or monthly climatic averages. A minority of studies investigated the effects of climate variables with direct mechanistic effects on growth or phenology, including temperature extremes, frost and drought indices, or growing-season duration. Furthermore, recent research has opened new avenues of investigation into the in-fluence of local soil and topographic variables, and even ectomycorrhizal communities over provenance per-formance. We make the case that future common-garden research into provenance-climate relationships should focus on climatic variables with demonstrated mechanistic connections to growth, survival, and phenology.

"237","Detection of range shifts: General methodological issues and case studies of butterflies","Parmesan, C.","Range shifts are perhaps the least controversial as well as the most easily observed responses expected under global warming scenarios. While changes at single study sites and along single species' range boundaries have been studied in a diversity of taxa, the wealth of historical records for butterflies has allowed changes across entire species' ranges to be analysed. This becomes important in distinguishing local distribution changes from systematic poleward/upward range shifts. Examination of 58 species in North America and Europe documented poleward shifts of species' ranges in proportions far higher than one would expect by chance. The magnitudes of the observed range shifts (boundary movement from 35 to 200 km) is on the same order as the magnitudes of regional warming (from 0.7 to 0.8 degreesC, equating to movement of temperature isotherms by 92 to 120 km). Coupled with general global warming, extreme weather and climate events have been increasing in magnitude and frequency on a global scale. Previous basic research on butterflies has provided detailed information on the mechanistic links between climate and population dynamics, reproductive behaviour, and extinction/colonisation dynamics. A synthesis of these studies indicates that such extreme climate events have driven observed butterfly range shifts. The sensitivity of butterflies to climate, the temporal and spatial breadth of distributional data (especially for European species), as well as the wealth of basic biological knowledge, allow studies of butterflies to provide an in-depth understanding of current impacts of climate change on wildlife. Further, the effects of non-climatic global change factors have been studied for many species. Species' habitat requirements are often well understood, and butterflies have served as useful organisms for studies of habitat fragmentation and restoration. These complementary fields of study, taken together, poise butterflies for being ideal models for understanding the intersecting effects of modern environmental changes, particularly the hardships imposed by climate change across an increasingly hostile landscape.",2001,"","FINGERPRINTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE: ADAPTED BEHAVIOUR AND SHIFTING SPECIES RANGES","","","57-76","WOS:000174089000004","","","#9358","Parmesan 2001","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-01 16:48:28)(Select): I couldn't find the whole reference, but I read enough pages in Google Books that I agree with Meagan - the distribution map includes Mexico, US, and Canada - and there is reference to poleward movement.

To help inform conservation management and policy responses, we present the results of an expert assessment of the threats that members of this taxonomic group face across migratory flyways. Most threats are increasing in intensity, particularly in non-breeding areas, where habitat loss resulting from residential and commercial development, aquaculture, mining, transport, disturbance, problematic invasive species, pollution and climate change were regarded as having the greatest detrimental impact. Fewer threats (mining, disturbance, problematic native species and climate change) were identified as widely affecting breeding areas. Numeniini populations face the greatest number of non-breeding threats in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, especially those associated with coastal reclamation; related threats were also identified across the Central and Atlantic Americas, and East Atlantic flyways. Threats on the breeding grounds were greatest in Central and Atlantic Americas, East Atlantic and West Asian flyways. Three priority actions were associated with monitoring and research: to monitor breeding population trends (which for species breeding in remote areas may best be achieved through surveys at key non-breeding sites), to deploy tracking technologies to identify migratory connectivity, and to monitor land-cover change across breeding and non-breeding areas. Two priority actions were focused on conservation and policy responses: to identify and effectively protect key non-breeding sites across all flyways (particularly in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway), and to implement successful conservation interventions at a sufficient scale across human-dominated landscapes for species' recovery to be achieved.

This article therefore provides an overview of the climate change migration nexus: on the basis of available empirical findings, it investigates the key issues at stake, including the social and political context in which the topic emerged; States' policy responses and the views of different institutional actors; critical perspectives on the actual relationship between the environment and (forced) migration; the concepts and notions most adequate to address this relationship; gender and human rights implications; as well as international law and policy orientations. Two major interconnected arguments arise. The first regards the weight of environmental and climatic factors in migration and their relationship to other push or pull factors, whether of a social, political, or economic nature. The second is about the political framework in which such migration flows should take place and the manner in which to treat the people who move in connection with environmental factors. The two issues are deeply intertwined, as the extent to which the environment determines migration is intimately connected to the status to be associated with the people concerned.",2011,"SEP","REFUGEE SURVEY QUARTERLY","30","3","1-23","WOS:000211958400001","10.1093/rsq/hdr006","","#9615","Piguet 2011","","Human movement",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

During the last glacial maximum, approximately 45% of the current North American range of Pacific salmon was covered in ice. Currently, most salmon habitat occurs in watersheds in which glacier ice is present and retreating. This synthesis examines the multiple ways that glacier retreat can influence aquatic ecosystems through the lens of Pacific salmon life cycles. We predict that the coming decades will result in areas in which salmon populations will be challenged by diminished water flows and elevated water temperatures, areas in which salmon productivity will be enhanced as downstream habitat suitability increases, and areas in which new river and lake habitat will be formed that can be colonized by anadromous salmon.

Publications were identified either as research, policy, literature review, historical comparison, or management papers. All papers were evaluated based on year of publication, area of interest, and type(s) of threats addressed. Research papers, however, were assessed in more depth. The publications ranged from the 1930s to 2010 and addressed the following threats: dams, pollution ( point and nonpoint), grazing, land use change, timber harvesting, water diversion, road construction, recreation, mining, groundwater pumping, invasive species, climate change, salinity, fire, insect and diseases, woody encroachment, watershed degradation, elimination of native vegetation, beavers, fire suppression, and fuel management. While the types of threats vary on spatial and temporal scales, some persist through decades in western North America.

"248","Merchant shipping's reliance on learning from incidents - A habit that needs to change for a challenging future","Pomeroy, R. V.; Earthy, J. V.","The safety record of the international merchant shipping industry has shown a continual improvement for a prolonged period due to its ability to learn from incidents and prevent recurrence; through training, education, technology development and regulatory change. However, the annual rate of ship losses has remained relatively unchanged in recent years. The industry has become accustomed to a safety regulatory regime based heavily on embedding lessons from incidents. That regime has served it well for more than a century but the industry is experiencing rapid change, which presents a challenge to this approach. This paper reviews the development of the maritime safety regulatory regime and the 'proof of need' attitude to new regulations that has been created. Regulators face challenges with changes in both technology and the operational model and the paper discusses these in the context of the desire to prevent future casualties without waiting for incidents. As future societal demands lead to the introduction of novel technology in order to solve massive challenges such as climate change the risks of incidents are likely to increase. The conclusion reached is that the industry has a strong culture based on a backward-facing approach to learning from incidents but to maintain a continual improvement in safety it has to adopt a forward-facing approach of similar rigour, using some form of 'learning without the incidents'. A way forward is postulated where 'synthetic lessons' from simulated incidents that have not actually happened are 'learned' and accepted as justification within the safety regulatory regime.

"249","Major perturbations in the Earth's forest ecosystems. Possible implications for global warming","Pravalie, R.","Forests are among the most important terrestrial ecological systems in terms of the multitude of ecosystem functions and services they provide. These biotic systems are vital not only for ensuring the wellbeing of human society and for preserving global biodiversity, but also for regulating the climate system, decarbonizing the atmosphere via carbon sequestration (in biomass or underlying soil carbon pools) and evaporative cooling processes that mitigate climate warming. However, forest ecosystems are currently being subjected to a wide range of natural and anthropic disturbances that pose a real threat not only to forest health and the various benefits forests provide for human society, but also to the overall functioning of the global system. This paper is a review that aims to analyse, in a brief and holistic manner, the main perturbations Earth forest ecosystems are currently facing, both the obvious (e.g. deforestation) and discrete/silent ones (e.g. defaunation) that have generally not yet been tackled strictly as ecological forest issues in the international scientific literature. At the same time, the paper aims to highlight the possible effects generated by forest perturbations in the global warming process, through carbon fluxes and biogeophysical feedbacks between these terrestrial systems and the atmosphere. Upon analysis of a vast scientific bibliography, it was found there currently are 12 major forest disturbances that can be grouped into three categories based on the prevalence of triggering causes, i.e. climatic (phenological shifts, range shifts, die-off events, insect infestations), anthropic (deforestation, fragmentation, air pollution) and mixed (defaunation, fires, composition shifts, net primary productivity shifts, biogeochemical shifts) perturbations. These ecological issues, which occur frequently, intensely and on large spatial scales, are able to significantly disrupt forest productivity and therefore strongly erode the forests'capacity to stabilize the climate system. All identified disturbances can amplify global warming in various ways, including by means of many positive feedback mechanisms in the case of climatic perturbations. Finally, this review paper proposes five major anthropogenic strategies to fight this multidimensional forest crisis mitigate, adapt, repair, protect and research actions, which, if implemented rapidly, efficiently and on a large scale via international policies, can successfully stabilize these terrestrial ecosystems and, implicitly, the climate system in the 21st century.",2018,"OCT","Earth-Science Reviews","185","","544-571","WOS:000448493500025","10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.06.010","","#9776","Pravalie 2018","Elizabeth  Gallegos  (2024-08-31 07:18:57)(Select): Not transboundary explicit ; Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-28 05:14:51)(Select): a useful overview of perturbations in forest systems, including a whole section of climatic perturbations that could be transboundary.

P.","In his seminal work, Hjort (in Fluctuations in the great fisheries of Northern Europe. Conseil Parmanent International Pour L'Exploration De La Mar. Rapports et Proces-Verbaux, 20: 1-228, 1914) observed that fish population levels fluctuated widely, year-class strength was set early in life, and egg production by adults could not alone explain variability in year-class strength. These observations laid the foundation for hypotheses on mechanisms driving recruitment variability in marine systems. More recently, researcher shave sought to explain year-class strength of important fish in the Laurentian Great Lakes and some of the hypotheses developed for marine fisheries have been transferred to Great Lakes fish. We conducted a literature review to determine the applicability of marine recruitment hypotheses to Great Lakes fish. We found that temperature, interspecific interactions, and spawner effects (abundance, age, and condition of adults) were the most important factors in explaining recruitment variability in Great Lakes fish, whereas relatively fewer studies identified bottom-up trophodynamic factors or hydrodynamic factors as important. Next, we compared recruitment between Great Lakes and Baltic Sea fish populations and found no statistical difference in factors driving recruitment between the two systems, indicating that recruitment hypotheses may often be transferable between Great Lakes and marine systems. Many recruitment hypotheses developed for marine fish have yet to be applied to Great Lakes fish. We suggest that future research on recruitment in the Great Lakes should focus on forecasting the effects of climate change and invasive species. Further, because the Great Lakes are smaller and more enclosed than marine systems, and have abundant fishery-independent data, they are excellent candidates for future hypothesis testing on recruitment in fish.",2014,"OCT","ICES Journal of Marine Science","71","8","2252-2267","WOS:000343317100025","10.1093/icesjms/fsu080","","#9813","Pritt 2014","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-08-27 06:20:28)(Select): study doesn't specifically discuss transboundary flows but reasonable transboundary assumption as the Great Lakes cross international boundaries ;","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

C.; Hampe, A.","Aim: Range shifts are expected to occur when populations at one range margin perform better than those at the other margin, yet no global trend in population performances at range margins has been demonstrated empirically across a wide range of taxa and biomes. Here we test the prediction that, if impacts of ongoing climate change on performance in marginal populations are widespread, then populations from the high-latitude margin (HLM) should perform as well as or better than central populations, whereas low-latitude margin (LLM) populations should perform worse. Location: Global. Time period: 1995-2019. Major taxa studied: Plants and animals. Methods:To test our prediction, we used a meta-analysis to quantify empirical support for asymmetry in the performance of high- and low-latitude margin populations compared to central populations. Performance estimates (survival, reproduction, or lifetime fitness) for populations occurring in their natural environment were derived from 51 papers involving 113 margin-centre comparisons from 54 species and 705 populations from the Americas, Europe, Africa and Australia. We then related these performance differences to climatic differences among populations. We also tested whether patterns are consistent across taxonomic kingdoms (plants vs animals) and across realms (marine vs terrestrial). Results: Populations at margins performed significantly worse than central populations, and this trend was primarily driven by the low-latitude margin. Although the difference was of small magnitude, it was largely consistent across biological kingdoms and realms. Differences in performance were weakly (p = .08) related to the difference in average temperatures between central and marginal populations. Main conclusions: The observed asymmetry in performance in marginal populations is consistent with predictions about the effects of global climate change, though further research is needed to confirm the effect of climate. It indicates that changes in demographic rates in marginal populations can serve as early-warning signals of impending range shifts.",2023,"JUN","Global Ecology and Biogeography","32","6","842-854","WOS:000957173800001","10.1111/geb.13665","","#9848","Pulido 2023","Dayo Osinubi (2024-08-09 08:29:54)(Select): This paper can be considered an original study that used a review of existing literature to compile data to which climate data was added for the analysis of climate effect on populations, especially at range margins.

The research results show that the impact of current Arctic shipping activities is extensive, and it can identify three major impacts: impact on water bodies, impact of air emissions and impact on animal survival. In this context, to mitigate the growing negative impact of shipping activities on the fragile Arctic environment, it is essential to adopt technical and operational solutions for ships and formulate new or stricter standards and rules for Arctic shipping activities.

D.","Different components of global environmental change are typically studied and managed independently, although there is a growing recognition that multiple drivers often interact in complex and nonadditive ways. We present a conceptual framework and empirical review of the interactive effects of climate change and invasive species in freshwater ecosystems, Climate change is expected to result in warmer water temperatures, shorter duration of ice cover, altered streamflow patterns, increased salinization, and increased demand for water storage and conveyance structures. These changes will alter the pathways by which non-native species enter aquatic systems by expanding fish-culture facilities and water gardens to new areas and by facilitating the spread of species during floods. Climate change will influence the likelihood of new species becoming established by eliminating cold temperatures or winter hypoxia that currently prevent survival and by increasing the construction of reservoirs that serve as hotspots for invasive species. Climate change will modify the ecological impacts of invasive species by enhancing their competitive and predatory effects on native species and by increasing the virulence of some diseases. As a result of climate change, new prevention and control strategies such as barrier construction or removal efforts may be needed to control invasive species that currently have only moderate effects or that are limited by seasonally unfavorable conditions, Although most researchers focus on how climate change will increase the number and severity of invasions, some invasive coldwater species may be unable to persist under the new climate conditions.

Beside temperature variability, other stressors reviewed include ultra violet (UV) radiation, organic pollutants, nutrient deposition, and biological invasions.

F.; Forster, I.; Chopin, T.; Brewer-Dalton, K.; Moccia, R. D.; Flaherty, M.; Smith, C. T.; De Silva, S.","The heavy reliance of most global aquaculture on the ambient environment suggests inherent vulnerability to climate change effects. This review explores the potential effects of climate change stressors on aquaculture biology and resources needed to support decision-making for vulnerability assessment, planned adaptation, and strategic research development. Climate change-mediated physiochemical outcomes important to aquaculture include extreme weather, precipitation and surge-based flooding, water stress, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, saltwater intrusion, and changes to temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. Culture practices, environment, and region affect stressor exposure, and biological response between species or populations are not universal. Response to a climate change stressor will be a function of where changes occur relative to optimal ranges and tolerance limits of an organism's life stage and physiological processes; the average magnitude of the stressor over the production cycle; stressor rate of change; variation, frequency, duration, and magnitude of extremes; epigenetic expression, genetic strain, and variation within and between populations; health and nutrition; and simultaneous stressor occurrence. The effects of simultaneous stressors will frequently interact, but may not be fully additive or synergistic. Disease is a major aquaculture limiter, and climate change is expected to further affect plant and animal health through the host and/or infectious agents. Climate change may introduce further complexity to the aquaculture-wild fishery relationship, with over two-thirds of animal aquaculture production dependent on external feed inputs. Higher production costs could be an economic outcome of climate change for many aquaculture sectors. Some aquaculture practices may inadvertently reduce resiliency to climate change, such as a reduction of coastal vegetation, coastal ground-water pumping, and reduction of population variability in pursuit of consistent production traits. Information from the largest aquaculture producers such as China and the top 3 global culture species is still sparse in the literature.

T.","Climate changes impose requirements for many species to shift their ranges to remain within environmentally tolerable areas, but near-continuous regions of intense human land use stretching across continental extents diminish dispersal prospects for many species. We reviewed the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation on species' abilities to track changing climates and existing plans to facilitate species dispersal in response to climate change through regions of intensive land uses, drawing on examples from North America and elsewhere. We identified an emerging analytical framework that accounts for variation in species' dispersal capacities relative to both the pace of climate change and habitat availability. Habitat loss and fragmentation hinder climate change tracking, particularly for specialists, by impeding both propagule dispersal and population growth. This framework can be used to identify prospective modern-era climatic refugia, where the pace of climate change has been slower than surrounding areas, that are defined relative to individual species' needs. The framework also underscores the importance of identifying and managing dispersal pathways or corridors through semi-continental land use barriers that can benefit many species simultaneously. These emerging strategies to facilitate range shifts must account for uncertainties around population adaptation to local environmental conditions. Accounting for uncertainties in climate change and dispersal capabilities among species and expanding biological monitoring programs within an adaptive management paradigm are vital strategies that will improve species' capacities to track rapidly shifting climatic conditions across landscapes dominated by intensive human land use.",2015,"DEC","Conservation Biology","29","6","1586-1595","WOS:000368334800011","10.1111/cobi.12556","","#10274","Robillard 2015","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

However, these wildfires also pose a range of social, economic, and environmental risks, with growing concern regarding persistent effects on stream flow volume, seasonal timing of flow, water quality, aquatic ecosystem health, and downstream community drinking water treatment. Here, we present the outcomes of a comprehensive scoping review of post-fire hydrologic studies in high-latitude forests of North America (Canada and Alaska). Our objectives were to (1) create an inventory of studies on post-fire hydrologic effects on surface water; (2) analyze those studies in terms of watershed characteristics and the type and duration of hydrologic effects; (3) identify and evaluate the link between upstream hydrologic effects with hydrologic ecosystem services; and (4) propose a research agenda addressing the link between wildfire science and hydrologic ecosystem services. We screened 2935 peer-reviewed articles and selected 82 studies to include based on their relevance according to a systematic, multi-step selection process. Next, we classified the papers into five themes: (a) runoff volume and flow regimes, (b) erosion and sediment transport, (c) water chemistry, (d) hydromorphology, and (e) aquatic food webs. For each study, we documented location, fire regime, watershed characteristics, and ecosystem services. The annual number of published studies on post-fire hydrology in high-latitude forests and, in particular, those addressing hydrologic ecosystem services, has increased steadily in recent years. Descriptions of wildfire characteristics, watershed characteristics, and effects on hydrologic ecosystem services were highly variable across studies, hindering cross-study comparisons. Moreover, there were limited efforts to extend study results to implications for forest or water management decisions regarding ecosystem services from source watersheds. Most studies focused on fire impacts on aquatic habitats and water chemistry while services of direct concern to communities, such as drinking water, were rarely addressed.

J.; Laflamme, G.","Purpose of ReviewGremmeniella abietina is a destructive forest pathogen responsible for Scleroderris canker, shoot dieback, defoliation, and tree death in forests and tree nurseries. This review is aimed at providing a complete description of the fungus, its distribution, the conditions for its spread, and the impact of climate change and at summarising the relevant forest management methods. Due to the worldwide importance of the pathogen, a retrospective review is required to summarise the lessons learned in relation to the disease, considering application to future outbreaks.Recent FindingsWe revise available management methods, considering examples of control strategies, with special focus on the silvicultural approaches, and we also revise the recovery of the affected stands and the associated trade-offs. Forest disturbances such as pests and disease outbreaks are expected to be exacerbated by climate change, although the exact impact on all host-pathogen interactions remains unclear. In regions with a high risk of G. abietina epidemics, climate change is expected to affect the pathogen differently.Gremmeniella abietina is a widely distributed forest pathogen in Europe and is also present in North America. Based on the conclusions reached in this review, forest stands may recover from pathogen outbreaks within 10 years, with considerable loss of growth and the risk of attack from secondary factors.

This paper reviews deliberative democracy and framing where they have been applied to examine public engagement on climate change. Integrating insights from these fields can help develop a practice of deliberative framing for managing climate change mitigation and adaptation actions at local scales, to complement national and international efforts. This could assist with community-based agenda setting toward greater justice and the public good.

B.; Volke, M. A.","This paper provides an overview of past, present and future themes for research and management of riparian zones, often relating to papers within this Wetlands Special Feature. Riparian research expanded in the United States around 1980 with themes that recognized (1) damage from excessive livestock, or (2) damage from river damming and diversion, and (3) the beneficial capacity of riparian buffers to intercept and assimilate nutrients and other water contaminants. Research expanded globally in the 1990s, with themes including (4) plant life history requirements and (5) reliance on fluvial geomorphic dynamics that enable riparian rejuvenation. Resource managers recognized that riparian areas provide (6) rich wildlife habitats (7) along with valued ecosystem services, (8) which encouraged conservation and restoration initiatives, (9) including environmental flow regimes. Floodplains are (10) vulnerable to invasive plants and management has included biocontrol such as for Tamarix in the American Southwest. Into the twenty-first century, (11) climate change is advancing, and riparian ecosystems may be especially impacted due to the compound challenges from increasing water demand and declining summer flows. As an emerging opportunity, (12) while reservoirs submerge floodplain vegetation, reservoir deltas may support compensatory riparian wetlands. (13) Studies increasingly utilize remote sensing tools including satellite imagery, LiDAR and unmanned aircraft systems, and (14) the coordination of large data sets invites digital ecology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning.

A.; Smokorowski, K. E.; Clarke, K.; Bradford, M. J.; Ghamry, H.; Olden, J. D.; Boisclair, D.; Cooke, S. J.","Background There is growing evidence of the potential negative consequences of altered flow regimes, in terms of magnitude, frequency, timing, duration or season pattern, on fluvial ecosystems and the fisheries they support. The scientific and policy communities have acknowledged the need for a better understanding of the effects of flow alteration on fish productivity. We conducted a systematic map to provide an overview of the existing literature base on the effects of flow-regime changes on direct outcomes of freshwater or estuarine fish productivity in temperate regions to inform stakeholders and policy makers. Methods To identify relevant articles for inclusion in this systematic map, we searched six bibliographic databases, 29 organizational websites, one search engine, and 297 reviews, and solicited grey literature through relevant sources. We screened articles at title and abstract, then by full-text using predefined inclusion criteria. Included studies were coded for key variables of interest, along with a very basic critical appraisal for internal validity (i.e., susceptibility to bias). The quantity and characteristics of the available evidence, knowledge gaps and subtopics with sufficient coverage for full systematic reviewing are reported in a narrative synthesis. The distribution and frequency of examined effects of flow-regime changes on fish productivity outcomes are presented in visual heatmaps. Review findings A total of 1368 studies from 1199 articles were included in the systematic map database and used to identify a number of interesting themes in the evidence base: (1) large evidence bases were found in temperate regions of United States of America (USA), Canada, and Australia; (2) most studies either used a temporal or spatial trend design i.e., lacking a 'true' before intervention time period, or no intervention control sites; (3) the most studied causes of altered flow regime were natural (e.g., floods, droughts, climate change), hydroelectric facilities (hydro), and dams with no hydro; and (4) there were clear clusters of studies evaluating effects of changes in magnitude and surrogate measures (e.g., velocity, water depth) on fish productivity outcomes, in particular abundance and diversity metrics. A number of potential knowledge gaps were identified: including geographic (Northern Africa, and possibly parts of Asia), causes of altered flow regime (restoration, land-use change, and water abstraction/extraction/diversion), interventions (flow duration, frequency, rate of change, or timing), outcomes (population viability) and specific intervention/cause/outcome groups (e.g., changes in flow magnitude due to hydro or natural causes and fish survival, performance, and reproduction). A few aspects in methodology were also identified across studies, primarily a lack of true comparators (e.g., temporal or spatial trend designs). Conclusions This map suggests subtopics warranting future evidence synthesis include, examinations into how changes in flow magnitude affects: (1) fish abundance for dams with no hydro causes; (2) fish abundance, diversity/richness, migration, and growth for hydro causes; and (3) fish abundance, diversity/richness, growth, community structure, recruitment, and migrating fish abundance for natural causes. More comprehensive evidence is needed to understand how: (1) fish productivity metrics are affected by changes in flow regime due to restoration, land-use change, and water withdrawal/diversion activities; (2) how fish productivity is affected by changes to components of flow regime other than magnitude (e.g. , flow duration, frequency); and (3) changes in flow magnitude due to hydro or natural causes affect fish survival, performance, and reproduction; and (4) changes in flow regime (all causes, all interventions) affect population viability.",2020,"APR 18","Environmental Evidence","9","1","","WOS:000529040200001","10.1186/s13750-020-00190-z","","#10527","Rytwinski 2020","","Biophysical",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

A.","Nesting populations of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the Atlantic and western Indian Oceans are increasing or stable while those in the Pacific are declining. It has been suggested that leatherbacks in the eastern Pacific may be resource limited due to environmental variability derived from the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), but this has yet to be tested. Here we explored bottom-up forcing and the responding reproductive output of nesting leatherbacks worldwide. We achieved this through an extensive review of leatherback nesting and migration data and by analyzing the spatial, temporal, and quantitative nature of resources as indicated by net primary production at post-nesting female migration and foraging areas. Leatherbacks in the eastern Pacific were the smallest in body size and had the lowest reproductive output due to less productive and inconsistent resources within their migration and foraging areas. This derived from natural interannual and multidecadal climate variability together with an influence of anthropogenic climate warming that is possibly affecting these natural cycles. The reproductive output of leatherbacks in the Atlantic and western Indian Oceans was nearly twice that of turtles in the eastern Pacific. The inconsistent nature of the Pacific Ocean may also render western Pacific leatherbacks susceptible to a more variable reproductive output; however, it appears that egg harvesting on nesting beaches is their major threat. We suggest that the eastern Pacific leatherback population is more sensitive to anthropogenic mortality due to recruitment rates that are lower and more variable, thus accounting for much of the population differences compared to Atlantic and western Indian turtles.",2008,"MAY","Ecology","89","5","1414-1427","WOS:000256101200023","10.1890/07-0364.1","","#10536","Saba 2008","Dayo Osinubi (2024-08-28 07:33:37)(Select): Review of nesting populations of leatherback turtles, with some coverage of parts of North America.

The aim was to propose an ecological framework for investigating the invasion of parasites that are trophically transmitted through predator-prey interactions, showing how despite the complexity of the cycles and the interactions among multiple hosts, such parasites can overcome multiple barriers and become invasive.

A.; Jacques, J.; Plante, N.; Fournier, V.; Pérez-López, E.","Climate change has facilitated the introduction, establishment, and movement of invasive species in northern regions, enabling the colonization of previously unsuitable areas. While the responses of insects to these changes have been increasingly studied, our understanding of how such alterations impact trophic interactions still requires further research to make reliable predictions about the spread of diseases in a warming world. Phytoplasmas, a group of obligate parasitic unculturable Mollicutes, primarily rely on leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) for transmission, spread, and survival. Phytoplasmas are associated with over 600 diseases affecting more than 1,000 plant species, including berries, grapevines, and other small fruits. In North America, diseases such as grapevine yellows, blueberry stunt, and strawberry green petal diseases have been linked to phytoplasma strains transmitted by known leafhopper species. However, the number of phytoplasma diseases has significantly increased in North America over the past decade, suggesting the presence of unidentified vectors or an abundance of leafhopper vectors. This short review provides an overview of the current knowledge on leafhoppers as vectors of phytoplasmas to berries, focusing on the last decade's research in Canada. This paper also explores the potential implications of climate change on this pathosystem, including the anticipated range expansion of leafhopper species, changes in phytoplasma acquisition and transmission, and the risk of new leafhopper-transmitted plant-pathogen introductions through the arrival of new leafhopper species.",2024,"JAN 17","Annals of the Entomological Society of America","117","1","14-20","WOS:001120750600001","10.1093/aesa/saad038","","#10717","Santos 2024","Tyler McIntosh (2024-09-07 03:08:03)(Select): c1: yes

D.","We review recent works on different life history variables of cladoceran taxa in tropical and temperate freshwater bodies, comparing the strategies that cladocerans have evolved to adapt to contrasting environmental conditions in the two geographical regions. These life-history parameters relate to age and size at maturity, survival, fecundity, life-expectancy at birth, lifespan, gross, and net reproductive rates, generation time, the rate of population increase, peak population density and day of peak abundance. We also discuss the role of photoperiod and temperature on some of these life history parameters. We found a general paucity of experimental work and field data in tropics on cladocerans. There is very limited information on the few Daphnia species found in the tropics. The misconception of low species diversity of cladocerans in the tropics arose due to several reasons including lack of extensive and intensive field collections. Higher water temperatures apparently promote permanent infestation of tropical waters with toxic cyanobacteria, which reduce the zooplankton diversity. In addition to higher temperatures in the tropics, the year-round high predation pressure of planktivorous fish probably causes the tropical species, particularly in pelagic habitats, to reach maturity earlier (< 3 days) than in temperate regions. Species of Daphnia in temperate regions are particularly adapted to living at food concentrations that are much lower and seasonably more variable than those for tropical genera such as Diaphanosoma. This is further corroborated by the more than an order of magnitude higher threshold food concentration (TFC for tropical Cladocera than for their temperate counterparts. Fecundity patterns differ between tropical and temperate cladoceran taxa: cultured under optimal temperature regimes, tropical taxa have fewer eggs than temperate species of a comparable body size. Predation pressure may act differently depending on the size of the cladoceran neonates and thus on their population size structure. Global warming and climate changes seem to affect the behaviour (migration), distribution, and abundance of cladocerans. Apparently, in direct response to these changes, the possibility of encountering the tropical cladocerans in the northern, temperate hemisphere (bioinvasions) is on the rise.",2005,"JUL 1","Hydrobiologia","542","","315-333","WOS:000231879200030","10.1007/s10750-004-3247-2","","#10746","Sarma 2005","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

L.","The wolverine is a wide-ranging and frequently at-risk or data-deficient species with dramatic range contractions across the northern hemisphere. Recent reports of low population densities inside and outside protected areas in western North America highlight the need for better conservation practice, policy, and planning across large landscapes. To assess broad habitat needs, we synthesized available wolverine habitat models in the Columbia and Rocky Mountains (63,000 km2), Canada. We used coefficients from four existing models to create spatial predictions over environmental datasets including snow, landcover, and roads. We averaged predictions using the distance-weighted mean of equal-area percentile habitat values and validated the output by comparison to independent data. Because persistent spring snow is tightly correlated with highquality habitat, we assessed 2080 spring snow cover forecasts (under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 high emissions scenario) to identify potential habitat refugia in British Columbia. Our synthesized habitat model identified high-quality habitat along mountain ranges, notably in the Purcell Mountains and the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains. Mean habitat value was 0.70 (SD: 0.19) inside protected areas and 0.55 (SD: 0.28) outside protected areas. The British Columbia side of the study area is forecasted to lose 44% of persistent spring snow cover by 2080, with declines identified inside many protected areas. By synthesizing existing habitat research and climate forecasts, we provided new insights at the broad spatial scale needed to conserve wide-ranging species like wolverine and to inform land-use planning for recreational access and the establishment and management of protected and conserved areas.",2023,"OCT","Global Ecology and Conservation","46","","","WOS:001056129400001","10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02540","","#10822","Schepens 2023","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

A.","P>The introduced pathogen Cronartium ribicola, cause of white pine blister rust, has spread across much of western North America and established known infestations within all but one species of white pine endemic to western Canada and the United States. Blister rust damage to severely diseased trees reduces reproduction and survival. Severe losses in white pine populations have resulted in site conversions to other species and seriously impacted resource values for timber, wildlife, watershed, recreation, aesthetic and other ecosystem services. In addition to blister rust, other major forest health threats and challenges to sustaining or restoring white pine populations are infestations of other pathogens, insects, fire, management practices that favour other tree species, and climatic change. Recent, large-scale outbreaks of mountain pine beetle have raised concerns for the viability of some white pine populations. In the 1960s, forest disease management for western white pine and sugar pine shifted from Ribes eradication to planting seedlings selected for better survival and resistance to blister rust. Seed orchards for producing improved white pines have been established, but deployment of that improved stock is hampered by a lack of planting opportunities. The inheritance and mechanisms of resistance are best known for western white pine and sugar pine; but new work is extending an understanding of genetics to all the western species of white pine. Current management efforts are focused on locating and protecting individual trees resistant to blister rust and assessing their disease resistance and other adaptive traits. In response to the threats from blister rust, the strategic goal is to sustain or restore viable white pine populations in western forest ecosystems. The four action components of the strategy are: (1) conserve genetic resistance to C. ribicola; (2) reduce the risk of adverse impact in stands currently uninfested; (3) restore and maintain white pines where blister rust is causing impacts and (4) assess and monitor the health and management of white pines.

The major purpose of this review is to summarise the current understanding as to how manmade factors influence the marine biocenosis of helminths, their intermediate hosts as well as seabirds as their final hosts. Moreover, it highlights current knowledge gaps regarding this ecosystem, which should be closed in order to gain a more complete understanding of these interactions. This work is primarily focused on helminths parasitizing seabirds of the North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean.The complex life cycles of seabird helminths may be impacted by fishing and aquaculture, as they interfere with the abundance of fish and seabird species, while the latter also affects the geographical distribution of intermediate hosts (marine bivalve and fish species), and may therefore alter the intertwined marine ecosystem. Increasing temperatures and seawater acidification as well as environmental pollutants may have negative or positive effects on different parts of this interactive ecosystem and may entail shifts in the abundance or regional distribution of parasites and/or intermediate and final hosts. Organic pollutants and trace elements may weaken the immune system of the hosting seabirds and hence affect the final host's ability to control the endoparasites. On the other hand, in some cases helminths seem to function as a sink for trace elements resulting in decreased concentrations of heavy metals in birds' tissues. Furthermore, this article also describes the role of helminths in mass mortality events amongst seabird populations, which beside natural causes (weather, viral and bacterial infections) have anthropogenous origin as well (e.g. oil spills, climate change, overfishing and environmental pollution).",2023,"DEC 1","HELMINTHOLOGIA","60","4","300-326","WOS:001142875800010","10.2478/helm-2023-0034","","#10916","Schwantes 2023","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-09-02 22:22:33)(Select): reasonable transboundary assumption with inclusion of North Atlantic and Arctic seas ;","Biophysical",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

It concluded that climate change is unequivocal and human activities are the dominant cause. Avoidance of dangerous climate change will require sustained substantial reductions of emissions by mid-century and that net emissions decrease to zero before 2100. This paper describes, reviews and explains the place of tourism in AR5 and AR5's relevance for tourism's future, including impacts, adaptation, vulnerabilities, and mitigation. Tourism's position in AR5 has strengthened, particularly with respect to the recognition of transboundary impacts, the sector's contribution to climate change and its mitigation requirements.

"275","Impacts of climate warming on hybrid zone movement: Geographically diffuse and biologically porous """"species borders""""","Scriber, J. M.","The ecology and evolutionary biology of insect-plant associations has realized extensive attention, especially during the past 60 years. The classifications (categorical designations) of continuous variation in biodiversity, ranging from global patterns (e.g., latitudinal gradients in species richness/diversity and degree of herbivore feeding specialization) to localized insect-plant associations that span the biospectrum from polyphenisms, polymorphisms, biotypes, demes, host races, to cryptic species, remain academically contentious. Semantic and biosystematic (taxonomical) disagreements sometimes detract from more important ecological and evolutionary processes that drive diversification, the dynamics of gene flow and local extinctions. This review addresses several aspects of insect specialization, host-associated divergence and ecological (including """"hybrid"""") speciation, with special reference to the climate warming impacts on species borders of hybridizing swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae). Interspecific hybrid introgression may result in collapse of multi-species communities or increase species numbers via homoploid hybrid speciation. We may see diverging, merging, or emerging genotypes across hybrid zones, all part of the ongoing processes of evolution. Molecular analyses of genetic mosaics and genomic dynamics with """"divergence hitchhiking"""", combined with ecological, ethological and physiological studies of """"species porosity"""", have already begun to unveil some answers for some important ecological/evolutionary questions. (i) How rapidly can host-associated divergence lead to new species (and why doesn't it always do so, e.g., resulting in """"incomplete"""" speciation)? (ii) How might """"speciation genes"""" function, and how/where would we find them? (iii) Can oscillations from specialists to generalists and back to specialists help explain global diversity in herbivorous insects? (iv) How could recombinant interspecific hybridization lead to divergence and speciation? From ancient phytochemically defined angiosperm affiliations to recent and very local geographical mosaics, the Papilionidae (swallowtail butterflies) have provided a model for enhanced understanding of ecological patterns and evolutionary processes, including host-associated genetic divergence, genomic mosaics, genetic hitchhiking and sex-linked speciation genes. Apparent homoploid hybrid speciation in Papilio appears to have been catalyzed by climate warming-induced interspecific introgression of some, but not all, species diagnostic traits, reflecting strong divergent selection (discordant), especially on the Z (= X) chromosome. Reproductive isolation of these novel recombinant hybrid genotypes appears to be accomplished via a delayed post-diapause emergence or temporal isolation, and is perhaps aided by the thermal landscape. Changing thermal landscapes appear to have created (and may destroy) novel recombinant hybrid genotypes and hybrid species.",2011,"APR","Insect Science","18","2","121-159","WOS:000288863900001","10.1111/j.1744-7917.2010.01367.x","","#10939","Scriber 2011","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-16 12:59:37)(Select): Agree, the US-Canada border is of interest and has specific climate change effects (species move due to warming) that change biodiversity (creating hybrid species, etc) ; Meagan Oldfather (2024-10-05 07:06:49)(Select): Changing hybridization zone between US and Canada with climate change; Anabel Kinsey (2024-07-27 16:20:53)(Screen): flow of genes may be relevant; ","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

L.","Climate change is adversely affecting the burden of infectious disease throughout the world, which is a health security threat. Climate-sensitive infectious disease includes vector-borne diseases such as malaria, whose transmission potential is expected to increase because of enhanced climatic suitability for the mosquito vector in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. Climatic suitability for the mosquitoes that can carry dengue, Zika, and chikungunya is also likely to increase, facilitating further increases in the geographic range and longer transmission seasons, and raising concern for expansion of these diseases into temperate zones, particularly under higher greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Early spring temperatures in 2018 seem to have contributed to the early onset and extensive West Nile virus outbreak in Europe, a pathogen expected to expand further beyond its current distribution, due to a warming climate. As for tick-borne diseases, climate change is projected to continue to contribute to the spread of Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis, particularly in North America and Europe. Schistosomiasis is a waterborne disease and public health concern in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia; climate change is anticipated to change its distribution, with both expansions and contractions expected. Other water-borne diseases that cause diarrheal diseases have declined significantly over the last decades owing to socioeconomic development and public health measures but changes in climate can reverse some of these positive developments. Weather and climate events, population movement, land use changes, urbanization, global trade, and other drivers can catalyze a succession of secondary events that can lead to a range of health impacts, including infectious disease outbreaks.

D.; Thornton, F.","The article evidences to what extent rights-based climate litigation is applied as a strategy to enhance the recognition and protection of climate-induced migrants. Adopting a deductive approach and desk review, the study, illustrates how climate-induced migration has been addressed by International Human Rights Law, with some attention also paid to the growing application of the right to a safe climate and climate justice. The study highlights the duties of both States and private actors in tackling the emerging climate crisis under the human rights agenda. Relevant responsibilities are framed in particular within the scope of rights-based litigation dealing with the topic. We present an analysis of litigation linked to climate-induced migration that was filed before distinct international, regional, and national jurisdictions and, in doing so, propose a chronology of cases-structured in three generations-of how population movements as a result of climate change have been discussed by judicial means. The first generation relates to cases that consider the issue from the perspective of protection-in both national, regional, and international jurisdictions. The second generation emerges within general climate litigation claims, involving commitments linked to the climate agenda. In addition to raising (forced) population movements as one of the expected impacts of climate change, such cases frequently call upon a rights-based approach. The third generation encompasses rights-based cases centred on climate-induced migrants per se. The strengths and limitations of rights-based litigation to respond to the topic are finally highlighted: we conclude that litigation remains a blunt but not unpromising tool to respond to climate-induced migration. Generic references to the risk of (forced) population movements largely prevail; nevertheless, strategic rights-based litigation can facilitate the visibility of climate-induced migrants to the international community, fostering the development of legal solutions in the longer term.",2024,"MAY 28","JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE","16","1","227-247","WOS:001143228900001","10.1093/jhuman/huad066","","#11007","Serraglio 2024","","Human movement; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

C.; Morison, J.; Zhang, T.; Barry, R. G.","Studies from a variety of disciplines document recent change in the northern high-latitude environment. Prompted by predictions of an amplified response of the Arctic to enhanced greenhouse forcing, we present a synthesis of these observations. Pronounced winter and spring warming over northern continents since about 1970 is partly compensated by cooling over the northern North Atlantic. Warming is also evident over the central Arctic Ocean. There is a downward tendency in sea ice extent, attended by warming and increased areal extent of the Arctic Ocean's Atlantic layer. Negative snow cover anomalies have dominated over both continents since the late 1980s and terrestrial precipitation has increased since 1900. Small Arctic glaciers have exhibited generally negative mass balances. While permafrost has warmed in Alaska and Russia, it has cooled in eastern Canada. There is evidence of increased plant growth, attended by greater shrub abundance and northward migration of the tree line. Evidence also suggests that the tundra has changed from a net sink to a net source of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Taken together, these results paint a reasonably coherent picture of change, but their interpretation as signals of enhanced greenhouse warming is open to debate. Many of the environmental records are either short, are of uncertain quality, or provide limited spatial coverage. The recent high-latitude warming is also no larger than the interdecadal temperature range during this century. Nevertheless, the general patterns of change broadly agree with model predictions. Roughly half of the pronounced recent rise in Northern Hemisphere winter temperatures reflects shifts in atmospheric circulation. However, such changes are not inconsistent with anthropogenic forcing and include generally positive phases of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations and extratropical responses to the El-Nino Southern Oscillation. An anthropogenic effect is also suggested from interpretation of the paleoclimate record, which indicates that the 20th century Arctic is the warmest of the past 400 years.",2000,"JUL","Climatic Change","46","1-2","159-207","WOS:000087703900006","10.1023/A:1005504031923","","#11011","Serreze 2000","","Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Our synthesis is based on an analysis of projected temperature, precipitation, and snowfall stratified by eight biogeoclimatic provinces and three vegetation zones. Five IPCC CMIP5 global climate models (GCMs) and two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are the basis for projections of mean annual temperature increasing from a current average (1961-1990) of 3.2 A degrees C to 4.9-6.9 A degrees C (5 GCM range; RCP4.5 scenario) or 6.4-8.7 A degrees C (RCP8.5), mean annual precipitation increasing from 3130 mm to 3210-3400 mm (3-9 % increase) or 3320-3690 mm (6-18 % increase), and total precipitation as snow decreasing from 1200 mm to 940-720 mm (22-40 % decrease) or 720-500 mm (40-58 % decrease) by the 2080s (2071-2100; 30-year normal period). These projected changes are anticipated to result in a cascade of ecosystem-level effects including: increased frequency of flooding and rain-on-snow events; an elevated snowline and reduced snowpack; changes in the timing and magnitude of stream flow, freshwater thermal regimes, and riverine nutrient exports; shrinking alpine habitats; altitudinal and latitudinal expansion of lowland and subalpine forest types; shifts in suitable habitat boundaries for vegetation and wildlife communities; adverse effects on species with rare ecological niches or limited dispersibility; and shifts in anadromous salmon distribution and productivity.

We assessed the temporal and spatial transitions of SSMP adoption and identified a broad perspective of 14 themes on SSMP adoption and highlight the research trends and gaps. Prior to 2010, research on SSMP adoption was concentrated on a few themes and has become diversified in later years, covering emerging themes such as climate change and use Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Publications on SSMP adoption exhibited a global distribution, with particular emphasis on the African continent due to the flow of donors' funds driven by severe soil degradation and limited use of improved technologies in Africa. Studies on minimum soil disturbance were prevalent worldwide, with the highest number of publications. Our findings also indicate a strong research collaboration between developed and developing countries, showcasing donor-driven collaborative efforts and mutual benefits across different regions. This review however highlights the limited inclusion of local knowledge in SSMP promotion and recommends a bottom-up approach for future initiatives.

L.; Klenk, N.; Wood, S.; Hewitt, N.; Henriques, I.; Yan, N.; Bazely, D. R.","Biofuels are being embraced worldwide as sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, because of their potential to promote energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while providing opportunities for job creation and economic diversification. However, biofuel production also raises a number of environmental concerns. One of these is the risk of biological invasion, which is a key issue with second generation biofuel crops derived from fast-growing perennial grasses and woody plant species. Many of the most popular second generation crops proposed for cultivation in the U.S. and Canada are not native to North America, and some are known to be invasive. The development of a large-scale biofuel industry on the continent could lead to the widespread introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive plant species if invasive risks are not properly considered as part of biofuel policy. In this paper, we evaluate the risk of biological invasion posed by the emerging second generation biofuel industry in the U.S. and Canada by examining the invasive risk of candidate biofuel plant species, and reviewing existing biofuel policies to determine how well they address the issue of invasive species. We find that numerous potentially invasive plant species are being considered for biofuel production in the U.S. and Canada, yet invasive risk receives little to no attention in these countries' biofuel policies. We identify several barriers to integrating invasive species and biofuel policy, relating to policy analytical capacity, governance, and conflicting policy objectives. We recommend that governments act now, while the second generation biofuel industry is in its infancy, to develop robust and proactive policy addressing invasive risk. Policy options to minimize biological invasions include banning the use of known invasive plant species, ongoing monitoring of approved species, and use of buffer zones around cultivated areas.

Leptospira spp. are classified into more than 250 serovars, but in many laboratories only 6 are routinely tested for in serologic agglutination tests of canine sera. Leptospiral infections in dogs may potentially go undetected with unemployed or currently employed diagnostic methods. Disease transmission from infected reservoir hosts usually occurs via urine-contaminated environmental sources such as water. Direct contact between infected and susceptible individuals, environmental factors such as climate changes in temperature and/or rainfall, and increasing number and urbanization of reservoir hosts may greatly increase dog exposure risks. A dog's lifestyle may influence exposure risk to leptospirosis, but vaccination based on proper identification of circulating serogroups dramatically reduces post-exposure infections.

M.","Background: Herbivores modify the structure and function of tundra ecosystems. Understanding their impacts is necessary to assess the responses of these ecosystems to ongoing environmental changes. However, the effects of herbivores on plants and ecosystem structure and function vary across the Arctic. Strong spatial variation in herbivore effects implies that the results of individual studies on herbivory depend on local conditions, i.e., their ecological context. An important first step in assessing whether generalizable conclusions can be produced is to identify the existing studies and assess how well they cover the underlying environmental conditions across the Arctic. This systematic map aims to identify the ecological contexts in which herbivore impacts on vegetation have been studied in the Arctic. Specifically, the primary question of the systematic map was: """"What evidence exists on the effects of herbivores on Arctic vegetation?"""". Methods: We used a published systematic map protocol to identify studies addressing the effects of herbivores on Arctic vegetation. We conducted searches for relevant literature in online databases, search engines and specialist websites. Literature was screened to identify eligible studies, defined as reporting primary data on herbivore impacts on Arctic plants and plant communities. We extracted information on variables that describe the ecological context of the studies, from the studies themselves and from geospatial data. We synthesized the findings narratively and created a Shiny App where the coded data are searchable and variables can be visually explored. Review findings We identified 309 relevant articles with 662 studies (representing different ecological contexts or datasets within the same article). These studies addressed vertebrate herbivory seven times more often than invertebrate herbivory. Geographically, the largest cluster of studies was in Northern Fennoscandia. Warmer and wetter parts of the Arctic had the largest representation, as did coastal areas and areas where the increase in temperature has been moderate. In contrast, studies spanned the full range of ecological context variables describing Arctic vertebrate herbivore diversity and human population density and impact. Conclusions: The current evidence base might not be sufficient to understand the effects of herbivores on Arctic vegetation throughout the region, as we identified clear biases in the distribution of herbivore studies in the Arctic and a limited evidence base on invertebrate herbivory. In particular, the overrepresentation of studies in areas with moderate increases in temperature prevents robust generalizations about the effects of herbivores under different climatic scenarios.",2021,"OCT 14","Environmental Evidence","10","1","","WOS:000707952200001","10.1186/s13750-021-00240-0","","#11470","Soininen 2021","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

"287","Marine range shifts and species introductions: comparative spread rates and community impacts","Sorte, C. J. B.; Williams, S. L.; Carlton, J. T.","Aim Shifts in species ranges are a predicted and realized effect of global climate change; however, few studies have addressed the rates and consequence of such shifts, particularly in marine systems. Given ecological similarities between shifting and introduced species, we examined how our understanding of range shifts may be informed by the more established study of non-native species introductions. Location Marine systems world-wide. Methods Database and citation searches were used to identify 129 marine species experiencing range shifts and to determine spread rates and impacts on recipient communities. Analyses of spread rates were based on studies for which post-establishment spread was reported in linear distance. The sizes of the effects of community impacts of shifting species were compared with those of functionally similar introduced species having ecologically similar impacts. Results Our review and meta-analyses revealed that: (1) 75% of the range shifts found through the database search were in the poleward direction, consistent with climate change scenarios, (2) spread rates of range shifts were lower than those of introductions, (3) shifting species spread over an order of magnitude faster in marine than in terrestrial systems, and (4) directions of community effects were largely negative and magnitudes were often similar for shifters and introduced species; however, this comparison was limited by few data for range-shifting species. Main conclusions Although marine range shifts are likely to proceed more slowly than marine introductions, the community-level effects could be as great, and in the same direction, as those of introduced species. Because it is well-established that introduced species are a primary threat to global biodiversity, it follows that, just like introductions, range shifts have the potential to seriously affect biological systems. In addition, given that ranges shift faster in marine than terrestrial environments, marine communities might be affected faster than terrestrial ones as species shift with climate change.

With Mexico as case study and through the examination of literature on foreign policy analysis, the author suggests that the search for a better performance in the energy sector could undermine previously made climate change actions and commitments, thus modifying foreign policy. This situation is assessed for two presidential terms. The previous administration was eager to locate and promote Mexico as a front-runner in climate change actions, developing national policies aimed at reducing emissions from pollution sources and actively participating at the international fora. On the other hand, the current government has followed a different approach. Now that the energy sector has been reformed, a potential increase in oil production can be expected, regardless of the promotion of renewable energy. Such an ambivalent attitude may send confusing signals to the international community about Mexico's role and position with respect to climate change, even though this modification is acknowledged as a result of a change in government.",2015,"DEC","LATIN AMERICAN POLICY","6","2","240-254","WOS:000371486300005","10.1111/lamp.12077","","#11531","Sosa-Núñez 2015","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-23 07:31:08)(Select): c1: clearly a synthesis of literature on the subject

Finally, a framework that summarizes some of the important oceanographic processes and their links to the food chain are reviewed. Species abundance and distribution are expected to change as a result of global climate change, potentially compromising the efficacy of marine protected areas as biodiversity conservation tools. This review suggests the need for: further interdisciplinary research and the use of linked models; an increase in marine protected areas for biodiversity conservation and as research sites for teasing apart fishing effects from climate effects; a temporally responsive approach to siting new marine protected areas, shifting their locations if necessary; and large-scale ecosystem/integrated management approaches to address the competing uses of the oceans and boundary-less threats such as global climate change and pollution.",2001,"","Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries","11","3","181-195","WOS:000178213500002","10.1023/A:1020364409616","","#11535","Soto 2001","Dayo Osinubi (2024-08-10 02:39:08)(Select): A review of the MPA framework with respect to climate change impact on bottom-up nutrient or energy flow.

Here, a three-dimensional conceptual framework of 'power as domination' is applied to the UNFCCC adaptation regime. We argue that this 'power-over' framing is an important lens through which to view adaptation, a field dominated by 'power-to', capacity-based constructs. The framework distinguishes between power-over manifesting through decision-making, agenda setting and preference shaping. Through a literature review we demonstrate that first and second dimension behavioral views of power-over fail to account for the subtle ways in which the interests and preferences of smallholder farmers are unknowingly shaped and restricted within the regime. Potential sources of third dimension preference shaping power are explored in a survey with high-level decision makers involved in National Adaptation Plans (NAP) development in seven countries. The results suggest that several inter-related features of the international agriculture adaptation regime collectively contribute to the shaping of interests and preferences of smallholders: prevailing discourses of uncertainty and the perceived limited capacity of smallholders; the resulting privileged status of 'expert' decision makers; the predominance of neoliberal development rationalities; and systemic biases resulting from the nation state as the principle unit of UNFCCC negotiation. These forces lie beyond the explanatory scope of first and second dimensions of power-over and help to explain why stakeholder engagement in adaptation decision making remains superficial in nature and why adaptation responses in agriculture can be considered 'common and non-differentiated'. We argue for increased awareness of third dimension manifestations and impacts of power in adaptation literature to facilitate the improved participation of marginalized stakeholders in UNFCCC and domestic adaptation decision making forums, to increase the diversity of adaptation options available to smallholders, and ultimately, to improve the attribution of responsibility for adaptation outcomes.

A.","Aim: Across the planet, grass-dominated biomes are experiencing shrub encroachment driven by atmospheric CO2 enrichment and land-use change. By altering resource structure and availability, shrub encroachment may have important impacts on vertebrate communities. We sought to determine the magnitude and variability of these effects across climatic gradients, continents, and taxa, and to learn whether shrub thinning restores the structure of vertebrate communities. Location: Worldwide. Time period: Contemporary. Major taxa studied: Terrestrial vertebrates. Methods: We estimated relationships between percentage shrub cover and the structure of terrestrial vertebrate communities (species richness, Shannon diversity and community abundance) in experimentally thinned and unmanipulated shrub-encroached grass-dominated biomes using systematic review and meta-analyses of 43 studies published from 1978 to 2016. We modelled the effects of continent, biome, mean annual precipitation, net primary productivity and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on the relationship between shrub cover and vertebrate community structure. Results: Species richness, Shannon diversity and total abundance had no consistent relationship with shrub encroachment and experimental thinning did not reverse encroachment effects on vertebrate communities. However, some effects of shrub encroachment on vertebrate communities differed with net primary productivity, amongst vertebrate groups, and across continents. Encroachment had negative effects on vertebrate diversity at low net primary productivity. Mammalian and herpetofaunal diversity decreased with shrub encroachment. Shrub encroachment also had negative effects on species richness and total abundance in Africa but positive effects in North America. Main conclusions: Biodiversity conservation and mitigation efforts responding to shrub encroachment should focus on low-productivity locations, on mammals and herpetofauna, and in Africa. However, targeted research in neglected regions such as central Asia and India will be needed to fill important gaps in our knowledge of shrub encroachment effects on vertebrates.

R.","American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) is a dominant component of forest tree cover over a large portion of eastern North America and this deciduous, mast-bearing tree species plays a key role in these forest ecosystems. Beech bark disease (BBD) is a scale insect-fungus complex that has caused the decline and death of afflicted beech trees. This disease has become a common feature in North American forest landscapes. Resistance to BBD is at the level of the beech scale (Cryptococcus fagisuga Lind.). Beech scale attack predisposes the tree to subsequent infection by Neonectria fungi. The impact of this tree disease has been shown to be significant, particularly in beech dominated forests. Scale-free trees (resistant to BBD) have been reported to range from only 1% to 3% in infested stands, with estimates ranging from 80-95% for overall infestation (for all beech within the current North American range). In addition to BBD, overall beech health will be directly impacted by climate change, if one specifically considers the expected fluctuations in precipitation leading to both drought periods and flooding. Beech is particularly sensitive to both extremes and is less resilient than other broad leaf tree species. Although the increase in global temperatures will likely shift the current range of the American beech, milder winters and less snowpack will favor propagation and survival of the beech scale. This review aims to present the current outlook for American beech in light of climate change. The natural history of the American beech and the onslaught of BBD during the last century will be covered, followed by the potential effects of a changing climate on BBD-infested forests. Evidence from models of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and other host-pathogen systems will supplement data directly gathered to evaluate BBD in American beech. We present the case that although climate change is likely to be a confounding factor in the continued loss of American beech, increasing our understanding of possible mechanisms of resistance and environmental factors that may influence susceptibility of American beech to BBD can inform proactive management strategies.",2017,"MAY","Forests","8","5","","WOS:000404099300017","10.3390/f8050155","","#11668","Stephanson 2017","","Biophysical; Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

X.; Kirkman, K.; Ochoa-Hueso, R.","Grasslands are globally-important ecosystems providing critical ecosystem services. The species composition and characteristics of grasslands vary considerably across the planet with a wide variety of different grasslands found. However, in many regions grasslands have been impacted by atmospheric nitrogen deposition originating from anthropogenic activities with effects on productivity, species composition and diversity widely reported. Impacts vary across grassland habitats but many show declines in species richness and increases in biomass production related to soil eutrophication and acidification. At a continental level, there is considerable variation in the research effort that has been put into understanding the impacts of nitrogen deposition. In Europe, North America and parts of Asia, although there are unanswered research questions, there is a good understanding of N deposition impacts in most grassland habitats. This is not the case in other regions with large knowledge gaps in some parts of the world.

D.","The Colorado River basin (CRB), the primary water source for southwestern North America, is divided into the 283,384 km(2), water-exporting Upper CRB (UCRB) in the Colorado Plateau geologic province, and the 344,440 km(2), water-receiving Lower CRB (LCRB) in the Basin and Range geologic province. Long-regarded as a snowmelt-fed river system, approximately half of the river's baseflow is derived from groundwater, much of it through springs. CRB springs are important for biota, culture, and the economy, but are highly threatened by a wide array of anthropogenic factors. We used existing literature, available databases, and field data to synthesize information on the distribution, ecohydrology, biodiversity, status, and potential socio-economic impacts of 20,872 reported CRB springs in relation to permanent stream distribution, human population growth, and climate change. CRB springs are patchily distributed, with highest density in montane and cliff-dominated landscapes. Mapping data quality is highly variable and many springs remain undocumented. Most CRB springs-influenced habitats are small, with a highly variable mean area of 2200 m(2), generating an estimated total springs habitat area of 45.4 km(2) (0.007% of the total CRB land area). Median discharge also is generally low and variable (0.10 L/s, N = 1687, 95% CI = 0.04 L/s), but ranges up to 1800 L/s. Water pH and conductivity is negatively related to elevation, with a stronger negative relationship in the UCRB compared to the LCRB. Natural springs water temperature and geochemistry throughout the CRB varies greatly among springs, but relatively little within springs, and depends on aquifer hydrogeology, elevation, and residence time. As the only state nearly entirely included within the CRB, Arizona is about equally divided between the two geologic provinces. Arizona springs produce approximately 0.6 km(3)/year of water. Data on >330 CRB springs-dependent taxa (SDT) revealed at least 62 plant species; 216 aquatic and riparian Mollusca, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, and other invertebrate taxa; several herpetofanual species; and two-thirds of 35 CRB fish taxa. Springs vegetation structure, composition, and diversity vary strongly by springs type, and plant species density within springs is high in comparison with upland habitats. Plant species richness and density is negatively related to elevation below 2500 m. Human population in and adjacent to the CRB are growing rapidly, and ecological impairment of springs exceeds 70% in many landscapes, particularly in urbanized and rangeland areas. Anthropogenic stressors are primarily related to groundwater depletion and pollution, livestock management, flow abstraction, non-native species introduction, and recreation. Ensuring the ecological integrity and sustainability of CRB groundwater supplies and springs will require more thorough basic inventory, assessment, research, information management, and local ecosystem rehabilitation, as well as improved groundwater and springs conservation policy.",2020,"MAY","Water","12","5","","WOS:000555915200280","10.3390/w12051501","","#11681","Stevens 2020","","Biophysical",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

However, the definition and parameters are numerous and variable. Characterization of drought also varies greatly, thus hindering the ability to compare results among areas. This review discusses new perspectives on conifer regeneration failure and places these studies into the context of drought and fire activity. We focus this review on three forest types where conifer regeneration failure is well documented: western boreal forests, cold mixed-conifer forests, and dry pine forests. To place the challenges to conifer tree regeneration in the context of regional climate trends, we present a novel regional analysis that summarizes drought conditions prior, during, and following the year of a large wildfire. We demonstrate the need to assess failure in the context of specific forest dynamics and well-defined metrics. For example, tree establishment may historically occur over longer periods, and current and future climate may exacerbate this and not promote pre-fire forest structure and composition. Many forests are undergoing rapid change and the type, magnitude, and causes of changes need to be compared among areas.

We provide a review of the abiotic conditions in glacial streams that are potential factors of their ecosystem function and biodiversity with an emphasis on their key primary producers, namely rock-attached algae or """"epilithon"""". Here, shrinking glaciers discharge over time less turbidmelt waters, resulting in slowermoving and more transparent stream conditions that are also warmer and more chemically dilute. We hypothesize that these environmental changeswill stimulate epilithic algal growth while also shifting its community structure towards larger and less nutritious taxa. Although such an increase in algal growth may benefit the productive harvestable fish capacity of certain mountain streams, a potential negative trade-off involves the proliferation of nuisance algae (e.g., Didymosphenia geminata), which thrives under clear, nutrient-poor mountain conditions.

Shifts in distribution may be possible for generalist species, but range shifts will be difficult for species with small distributions, specialized habitat requirements, slow dispersal rates, and species at high elevations. Accurate assessments of climate change impacts on biodiversity of the region are difficult because of confusion about nomenclature, the many species unknown to science, the lack of baseline data on species' ecology and distributions, and lack of fine resolution elevation data for very small islands.

In North America, highly visible disasters have already caused populations to relocate, but historically, larger scale migration has occurred in response to longer term climatic shifts. As relocation to destinations spanning small towns to metropolitan gateways accelerates, planning can play a central role in shaping how these places accommodate newcomers and prepare for longer term urban restructuring. To lay the groundwork for this emerging area of research and practice, we draw from adjacent areas of planning. We examine current research on immigrant integration and amenity migration, recent media coverage of climate destinations, research on shifts in physical livability, and the emerging body of work on receiving communities. Limitations to our study include a focus on recent research and confining the geographical scope to North America. Based on our review, we found that migration is only adaptation when newcomers are effectively integrated into receiving communities. This can occur through reconciling social inclusion with economic development, meeting the distinct needs of newcomers that may also exacerbate the needs of current residents, and pursuing long-term planning for deconcentration.Takeaway for practiceAs climate-related migration becomes part of adaptation practice, planners should focus on reconciling social inclusion and economic development and engaging newcomers and existing residents in participatory processes to develop physical and social resilience.",2024,"JAN 2","JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION","90","1","30-49","WOS:000982936900001","10.1080/01944363.2023.2188242","","#12023","Teicher 2024","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-22 03:55:49)(Select): includes a nice section on land use planning in communities receiving climate migrants, considering it as enough of a biodiversity link; ","Human movement",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

In the Arctic, there is a clash of two discourses - scientific discourse on concern for the impacts of climate change and neoliberal discourse of new opportunities for resource exploitation made possible by the climate change. The chapter studies the national communications of eight Arctic states to the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change since the early 1990s to analyze three related questions (1) how the concern for the climate change and its impacts are articulated as """"governable problems"""" in the national communications, (2) how the regional concern for the Arctic is manifested nationally and (3) how the agency in developing preparedness, and responses to climate change impacts are constructed in these communications. The analysis of the concern for the climate change impacts in the Arctic countries show that the national concerns are constructed by using different discursive strategies. Most of the Arctic countries have found their """"arcticness"""" after the publication of the ACIA report in 2004. The main reason for these national approaches to differ so much in their approach to the Arctic region is largely explained by the simple fact that these reports are written from the perspective of national economic interest. In this national economic interest arctic region offer natural resources and climate change in many cases promises to help the exploitation of these resources.

These include raising awareness of risks and strategies, enhancing corporate responsibility, being informed about policy changes, laws and regulations, fostering just energy transitions, energy democracy, divestment, alternative market solutions, and forcing the postponement or cancellation of targeted hydrocarbon activities. While the institutional means are widely used and seem to support policy change and regulation, these strategies are not used to deliver awareness or postponement outcomes. Similarly, while movements tend to rely on civil disobedience to stop hydrocarbon projects in the short term, they rely on multiple strategies to cancel them in the longer term.

"304","Natural disturbances as drivers of tipping points in forest ecosystems under climate change - implications for adaptive management","Thom, D.","As climate continues to change, disturbances may increasingly navigate forest ecosystems towards tipping points, causing irreversible state shifts and a loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. In this review, I elaborate the Special Issue topic 'Natural disturbances as tipping points of forest ecosystems under climate change' featured by Forestry and suggest a suit of adaptive measures to mitigate increasing disturbances and their impacts on forest ecosystems. The Special Issue contains seven case studies assessing drought, fire, wind and bark beetle disturbances in Europe, North America and Africa. Despite high severities and/or frequencies, disturbances have not yet induced a shift of the investigated forest ecosystems towards an alternative state. Instead, forests have shown high resistance, resilience or both. For instance, one case study reveals that short-interval fires in European beech forests may not even significantly alter tree species composition due to the high resprouting ability of beech. Yet, other case studies identify distinct differences in resilience amongst ecoregions, and indicate that climate change and disturbance interactions might tip the future carbon balance of forests from sink to source. Many forest ecosystems are likely able to cope with future increases in disturbance activity to some degree. However, tipping points might vary across ecosystems dominated by different disturbance agents. While wind and bark beetles mainly affect canopy trees, fire and drought also directly impair tree regeneration, thus reducing the capacity of ecosystems to recover and reorganize. Hence, forest ecosystems in which fire and drought are the dominant disturbance agents might approach tipping points earlier than forests dominated by other agents if disturbance activity continues to increase. Several proactive and reactive adaptive measures are available to mitigate increasing disturbances, but more research is needed to develop robust and region-specific strategies to prevent tipping points in forest ecosystems.",2023,"MAY 5","FORESTRY","96","3","305-315","WOS:000949155300001","10.1093/forestry/cpad011","","#12087","Thom 2023","","Biophysical; Biotic; Perspective paper; Potentially relevant; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"305","The economic and environment benefits from international co-ordination on carbon pricing: a review of economic modelling studies *","Thube, S.; Peterson, S.; Nachtigall, D.; Ellis, J.","This paper reviews quantitative estimates of the economic and environmental benefits from different forms of international co-ordination on carbon pricing based on economic modelling studies. Forms of international co-ordination include: harmonising carbon prices (e.g. through linking carbon markets), extending the coverage of pricing schemes, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, developing international sectoral agreements, and establishing co-ordination mechanisms to mitigate carbon leakage. All forms of international co-operation on carbon pricing could deliver benefits, both economic (e.g. lower mitigation costs) and environmental (e.g. reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon leakage). There is scope to considerably increase the coverage of carbon pricing, since until 2021 only around 40% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 44 OECD and G20 countries face a carbon price. There is also significant scope to improve international co-ordination on carbon pricing: moving from unilateral carbon prices to a globally harmonized carbon price to reach the 1st round of NDC targets for 2030 can reduce global mitigation cost on average by two thirds or $229 billion. Benefits tend to be higher with broader participation of countries, broader coverage of emissions and sectors and, more ambitious policy goals. Extending carbon pricing to non-CO2 GHG could reduce global mitigation costs by up to 48%. Absolute cost savings from harmonized carbon prices increase by almost 70% in 2030 for reductions in line with the 2 degrees C target. Most, but not all, countries gain economic benefits from international co-operation, and these benefits vary significantly across countries and regions. Complementary measures outside co-operation on carbon pricing (e.g. technology transfers) could potentially ensure that co-operation provides economic benefits for all countries.",2021,"NOV","Environmental Research Letters","16","11","","WOS:000709100400001","10.1088/1748-9326/ac2b61","","#12133","Thube 2021","","Intervention; Sociocultural; Transboundary unclear",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

T.","Ticks are able to transmit the highest number of pathogen species of any blood-feeding arthropod and represent a growing threat to public health and agricultural systems worldwide. While there are numerous and varied causes and effects of changes to tick-borne disease (re)emergence, three primary challenges to tick control were identified in this review from a U.S. borders perspective. (1) Climate change is implicated in current and future alterations to geographic ranges and population densities of tick species, pathogens they can transmit, and their host and reservoir species, as highlighted by Ixodes scapularis and its expansion across southern Canada. (2) Modern technological advances have created an increasingly interconnected world, contributing to an increase in invasive tick species introductions through the increased speed and frequency of trade and travel. The introduction of the invasive Haemaphysalis longicornis in the eastern U.S. exemplifies the challenges with control in a highly interconnected world. (3) Lastly, while not a new challenge, differences in disease surveillance, control, and management strategies in bordering countries remains a critical challenge in managing ticks and tick-borne diseases. International inter-agency collaborations along the U.S.-Mexico border have been critical in control and mitigation of cattle fever ticks (Rhipicephalus spp.) and highlight the need for continued collaboration and research into integrated tick management strategies.

"307","The Importance of Physiological Limits in Determining Biogeographical Range Shifts due to Global Climate Change: The Heat-Shock Response","Tomanek, L.","Physiological processes that set an organism's thermal limits are in part determining recent shifts in biogeographic distribution ranges due to global climate change. Several characteristics of the heat-shock response (HSR), such as the onset, maximal, and upper limit of heat-shock protein (Hsp) synthesis, contribute to setting the acute upper thermal limits of most organisms. Aquatic animals from stable, moderately variable, or highly variable thermal environments differ in their HSR. Some animals living in extremely stable thermal environments lack the response altogether. In contrast, rocky intertidal animals that experience highly variable thermal conditions start synthesizing Hsps, that is, the onset of synthesis, below the highest temperatures that they experience. Thus, these organisms experience thermal conditions in their environment that are close to the upper thermal limits in which they can defend themselves against cellular thermal insults by employing the HSR. Subtidal animals are characterized by moderately variable thermal environments, and their cells start synthesizing Hsps above the highest temperatures that they experience. The upper thermal limits against which they can defend themselves are thus much higher than the highest body temperatures they currently experience. Furthermore, the ability to acclimate to changing thermal conditions seems greatest among animals from moderately variable environments and limited in animals from stable and highly variable environments. Thus, these findings suggest that organisms with the narrowest (stenothermal) and the widest (highly eurythermal) temperature tolerance ranges live closest to their thermal limits and have a limited ability to acclimate, suggesting that they will be most affected by global climate change.",2008,"NOV-DEC","Physiological and Biochemical Zoology","81","6","709-717","WOS:000260547400002","10.1086/590163","","#12200","Tomanek 2008","Dayo Osinubi (2024-08-09 08:42:35)(Select): A review of heat stress response in determining range shift in marine snail species.

Over the past century, Lecanosticta acicola, a foliar pathogen predominantly of Pinus spp., has expanded its range globally, and is increasing in impact. Lecanosticta acicola causes brown spot needle blight, resulting in premature defoliation, reduced growth, and mortality in some hosts. Originating from southern regions of North American, it devastated forests in the USA's southern states in the early twentieth century, and in 1942 was discovered in Spain.Derived from Euphresco project 'Brownspotrisk,' this study aimed to establish the current distribution of Lecanosticta species, and assess the risks of L. acicola to European forests. Pathogen reports from the literature, and new/ unpublished survey data were combined into an open-access geo-database (http://www.portaloff orestpathology.com), and used to visualise the pathogen's range, infer its climatic tolerance, and update its host range. Lecanosticta species have now been recorded in 44 countries, mostly in the northern hemisphere. The type species, L. acicola, has increased its range in recent years, and is present in 24 out of the 26 European countries where data were available. Other species of Lecanosticta are largely restricted to Mexico and Central America, and recently Colombia.The geo-database records demonstrate that L. acicola tolerates a wide range of climates across the northern hemisphere, and indicate its potential to colonise Pinus spp. forests across large swathes of the Europe. Pre-liminary analyses suggest L. acicola could affect 62% of global Pinus species area by the end of this century, under climate change predictions.Although its host range appears slightly narrower than the similar Dothistroma species, Lecanosticta species were recorded on 70 host taxa, mostly Pinus spp., but including, Cedrus and Picea spp. Twenty-three, including species of critical ecological, environmental and economic significance in Europe, are highly susceptible to L. acicola, suffering heavy defoliation and sometimes mortality. Variation in apparent susceptibility between reports could reflect variation between regions in the hosts' genetic make-up, but could also reflect the signif-icant variation in L. acicola populations and lineages found across Europe. This study served to highlight sig-nificant gaps in our understanding of the pathogen's behaviour.Lecanosticta acicola has recently been downgraded from an A1 quarantine pest to a regulated non quarantine pathogen, and is now widely distributed across Europe.

Climato-economic theorizing proposes that humans adapt needs, stresses, and choices of goals, means, and outcomes to the livability of their habitat. The evolutionary process at work is one of collectively meeting climatic demands of cold winters or hot summers by using monetary resources. Freedom is expected to be lowest in poor populations threatened by demanding thermal climates, intermediate in populations comforted by undemanding temperate climates irrespective of income per head, and highest in rich populations challenged by demanding thermal climates. This core hypothesis is supported with new survey data across 85 countries and 15 Chinese provinces and with a reinterpretative review of results of prior studies comprising 174 countries and the 50 states in the United States. Empirical support covers freedom from want, freedom from fear, freedom of expression and participation, freedom from discrimination, and freedom to develop and realize one's human potential. Applying the theory to projections of temperature and income for 104 countries by 2112 forecasts that (a) poor populations in Asia, perhaps except Afghans and Pakistanis, will move up the international ladder of freedom, (b) poor populations in Africa will lose, rather than gain, relative levels of freedom unless climate protection and poverty reduction prevent this from happening, and (c) several rich populations will be challenged to defend current levels of freedom against worsening climato-economic livability.",2013,"OCT","BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES","36","5","465-480","WOS:000325681000001","10.1017/S0140525X12002828","","#12456","VandeVliert 2013","","Sociocultural; Transboundary unclear",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

D.; Popova, V.; Deser, C.; Holland, M.; Prowse, T.","Atmospheric humidity, clouds, precipitation, and evapotranspiration are essential components of the Arctic climate system. During recent decades, specific humidity and precipitation have generally increased in the Arctic, but changes in evapotranspiration are poorly known. Trends in clouds vary depending on the region and season. Climate model experiments suggest that increases in precipitation are related to global warming. In turn, feedbacks associated with the increase in atmospheric moisture and decrease in sea ice and snow cover have contributed to the Arctic amplification of global warming. Climate models have captured the overall wetting trend but have limited success in reproducing regional details. For the rest of the 21st century, climate models project strong warming and increasing precipitation, but different models yield different results for changes in cloud cover. The model differences are largest in months of minimum sea ice cover. Evapotranspiration is projected to increase in winter but in summer to decrease over the oceans and increase over land. Increasing net precipitation increases river discharge to the Arctic Ocean. Over sea ice in summer, projected increase in rain and decrease in snowfall decrease the surface albedo and, hence, further amplify snow/ice surface melt. With reducing sea ice, wind forcing on the Arctic Ocean increases with impacts on ocean currents and freshwater transport out of the Arctic. Improvements in observations, process understanding, and modeling capabilities are needed to better quantify the atmospheric role in the Arctic water cycle and its changes.",2016,"MAR","JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES","121","3","586-620","WOS:000374345000003","10.1002/2015JG003132","","#12638","Vihma 2016","","Biophysical",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"311","Climate change and impacts of boreal forest insects","Volney, W. J. A.; Fleming, R. A.","The circum-polar boreal forest has played an important role in the wealth of northern nations since the 15th century. Its natural resources spurred strategic geopolitical developments beginning in the 16th century but intense development of the boreal forest is largely limited to the 20th century. Insects cause considerable loss of wood that has an adverse effect on the balance of carbon sequestered by forests. Current understanding of processes that lead to stand-replacing outbreaks in three insect species is reviewed in this paper. Many of these processes depend on climate either directly, such as reduced survival with extreme weather events, or indirectly, mainly through effects on the host trees. In the boreal zone of Canada, pest-caused timber losses may be as much as 1.3-2.0 times the mean annual depletions due to fires. Pests are thus major, but consistently overlooked forest ecosystem components that have manifold consequences to the structure and functions of future forests. Global change will have demonstrable changes in the frequency and intensity of pest outbreaks, particularly at the margins of host ranges. The consequent shunting of carbon back to the atmosphere rather than to sequestration in forests as biomass is thought to have positive feedback to global warming. Whereas significant progress has been made in developing carbon budget models for the boreal forests of Canada, enormous problems remain in incorporating pest effects in these models. These problems have their origins in the nature of interactions among pests with forest productivity, and problems with scaling. The common problems of verification and validation of model results are particularly troublesome in projecting future forest productivity. The interaction of insects with fires must be accounted for if realistic carbon sequestration forecasts in a warming climate are to be made, These problems make assessments of mitigation and adaptation of pest management alternatives difficult to evaluate at present. Nevertheless, the impacts of stand-replacing insect population outbreaks is important in formulating future resource management policy. Crown Copyright (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

"312","Insect Declines in the Anthropocene","Wagner, D. L.; Douglas, A. E.","Insect declines are being reported worldwide for flying, ground, and aquatic lineages. Most reports come from western and northern Europe, where the insect fauna is well-studied and there are considerable demographic data for many taxonomically disparate lineages. Additional cases of faunal losses have been noted from Asia, North America, the Arctic, the Neotropics, and elsewhere. While this review addresses both species loss and population declines, its emphasis is on the latter. Declines of abundant species can be especially worrisome, given that they anchor trophic interactions and shoulder many of the essential ecosystem services of their respective communities. A review of the factors believed to be responsible for observed collapses and those perceived to be especially threatening to insects form the core of this treatment. In addition to widely recognized threats to insect biodiversity, e.g., habitat destruction, agricultural intensification (including pesticide use), climate change, and invasive species, this assessment highlights a few less commonly considered factors such as atmospheric nitrification from the burning of fossil fuels and the effects of droughts and changing precipitation patterns. Because the geographic extent and magnitude of insect declines are largely unknown, there is an urgent need for monitoring efforts, especially across ecological gradients, which will help to identify important causal factors in declines.

H.","Background West Nile virus (WNV), the most widely distributed flavivirus causing encephalitis globally, is a vector-borne pathogen of global importance. The changing climate is poised to reshape the landscape of various infectious diseases, particularly vector-borne ones like WNV. Understanding the anticipated geographical and range shifts in disease transmission due to climate change, alongside effective adaptation strategies, is critical for mitigating future public health impacts. This scoping review aims to consolidate evidence on the impact of climate change on WNV and to identify a spectrum of applicable adaptation strategies.Main body We systematically analyzed research articles from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCOhost. Our criteria included English-language research articles published between 2007 and 2023, focusing on the impacts of climate change on WNV and related adaptation strategies. We extracted data concerning study objectives, populations, geographical focus, and specific findings. Literature was categorized into two primary themes: 1) climate-WNV associations, and 2) climate change impacts on WNV transmission, providing a clear understanding. Out of 2168 articles reviewed, 120 met our criteria. Most evidence originated from North America (59.2%) and Europe (28.3%), with a primary focus on human cases (31.7%). Studies on climate-WNV correlations (n = 83) highlighted temperature (67.5%) as a pivotal climate factor. In the analysis of climate change impacts on WNV (n = 37), most evidence suggested that climate change may affect the transmission and distribution of WNV, with the extent of the impact depending on local and regional conditions. Although few studies directly addressed the implementation of adaptation strategies for climate-induced disease transmission, the proposed strategies (n = 49) fell into six categories: 1) surveillance and monitoring (38.8%), 2) predictive modeling (18.4%), 3) cross-disciplinary collaboration (16.3%), 4) environmental management (12.2%), 5) public education (8.2%), and 6) health system readiness (6.1%). Additionally, we developed an accessible online platform to summarize the evidence on climate change impacts on WNV transmission (https://2xzl2o-neaop.shinyapps.io/WNVScopingReview/).Conclusions This review reveals that climate change may affect the transmission and distribution of WNV, but the literature reflects only a small share of the global WNV dynamics. There is an urgent need for adaptive responses to anticipate and respond to the climate-driven spread of WNV. Nevertheless, studies focusing on these adaptation responses are sparse compared to those examining the impacts of climate change. Further research on the impacts of climate change and adaptation strategies for vector-borne diseases, along with more comprehensive evidence synthesis, is needed to inform effective policy responses tailored to local contexts.",2024,"MAY 24","Infectious Diseases of Poverty","13","1","","WOS:001232468700001","10.1186/s40249-024-01207-2","","#12836","Wang 2024","Dayo Osinubi (2024-08-29 05:27:22)(Select): This review focused on the impacts of climate change on West Nile Virus (WNV) globally and related adaptation strategies, with emphasis on climate‑WNV associations, and climate change impacts on WNV transmission.

Here, a systematic literature review was completed for eight fish species found across the North American Arctic, with a focus on Inuit Nunangat, to identify major prey items, summarize feeding strategies, and highlight data gaps. Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus), Dolly Varden Char (Salvelinus malma), Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush), Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus), Inconnu (Stenodus leucichthys), Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), Broad Whitefish (Coregonus nasus), and Burbot (Lota lota), were selected as species of interest due to their ecological and cultural importance. The 74 studies reviewed indicate that these species are generalist feeders that demonstrate wide dietary niches, as well as the tendency to avoid agonistic interactions by partitioning resources when they co-occur with an overlapping species. Across coastal, lacustrine, and riverine systems, the most commonly consumed prey items are insects (Diptera spp.), as well as benthic forage fishes such as sculpins (Family: Cottidae). Insects are major prey items in riverine systems, where diets appear to be more generalized, compared to lakes. Anadromous species in coastal waters most commonly feed on various crustaceans and forage fishes. Benthic forage fishes, insects, zooplankton, and mollusks are widely consumed prey items in Arctic lakes. Burbot, Inconnu, and resident Dolly Varden had the most specialized feeding strategies, due in part to their habitat requirements and morphology, while Lake Trout and resident Arctic Char often form multiple ecotypes in lakes, some with different feeding behaviors. Knowledge gaps regarding northern fish trophic ecology are highlighted, and in particular include riverine systems and winter foraging behavior. This review is intended to inform predictions regarding the impacts of climate change on fish tropic ecology and to guide future research.",2023,"MAY","Polar Biology","46","5","409-425","WOS:000975982700001","10.1007/s00300-023-03133-9","","#13133","Wight 2023","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-23 08:28:52)(Select): c1: yes

E.; Flockhart, D. T. T.; Newman, A. E. M.; Norris, D. R.","The migratory monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) of eastern North America have undergone large-scale declines, which may be attributable to a variety of underlying causes. The uncertainty about the primary cause of declines and whether individual threats are likely to increase in the future presents challenges for developing effective conservation management and policy initiatives that aim to improve population viability. This paper identifies five potential threats and classifies these threats according to the types of studies (observational, experimental, simulation/models) and their current impact and anticipated risk. Broadly, the threats can be classified into five categories: (1) change in suitable abiotic environmental conditions; (2) deforestation in the overwintering range; (3) exposure to contaminants including the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis, herbicides, and insecticides; (4) loss of breeding habitat; and (5) predation, parasitism, and species-specific pathogens. The vast distribution of the monarch butterfly makes it likely that population declines are attributed to a suite of interacting factors that vary spatially and temporally in their contribution. Nonetheless, the published papers we reviewed suggest the decline in suitable environmental conditions in addition to overwintering (i.e., deforestation) and breeding habitat loss are the most likely threats to continue to affect the population viability of monarch butterflies.",2019,"APR 5","Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","7","","","WOS:000467430400001","10.3389/fevo.2019.00099","","#13138","Wilcox 2019","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Current IPCC assessments cannot address the local scale impacts and adaptive needs of Arctic Indigenous communities based on the global, top-down model approaches used. Inuit maintain the longest unrecorded climate history of sea ice in Canada, and to support Inuit community needs, a decolonized, Inuit knowledge-based approach was co-developed in the community of Mittimatalik, Nunavut (Canada) to create the Mittimatalik siku asijjipallianinga (sea ice climate atlas) 1997-2019. This paper presents the novel approach used to develop the atlas based on Inuit knowledge, earth observations and Canadian Ice Service (CIS) sea ice charts, and demonstrates its application. The atlas provides an adaptation tool that Mittimatalik can use to share locations of known and changing sea ice conditions to plan for safe sea ice travel. These maps can also be used to support the safety and situational awareness of territorial and national search and rescue partners, often coming from outside the region and having limited knowledge of local sea ice conditions. The atlas demonstrates the scientific merit of Inuit knowledge in environmental assessments for negotiating a proposal to extend the shipping seasons for the nearby Mary River Mine. The timing and rates of sea ice freeze-up (October-December) in Mittimatalik are highly variable. There were no significant trends to indicate that sea ice is freezing up later to support increased shipping opportunities into the fall. The atlas shows that the first 2 weeks of November are critical for landfast ice formation, and icebreaking at this time would compromise the integrity of the sea ice for safe travel, wildlife migration and reproduction into the winter months. There was evidence that sea ice break-up (May-July) and the fracturing of the nearby floe edge have been occurring earlier in the last 10 years (2010-2019). Shipping earlier into the break-up season could accelerate the break-up of an already declining sea ice travel season, that Inuit are struggling to maintain.",2021,"OCT 26","Frontiers in Climate","3","","","WOS:001021792700001","10.3389/fclim.2021.715105","","#13200","Wilson 2021","Laura  Dee (2024-08-30 23:20:53)(Select): Not a mention of biodiversity per se, but does impact NCPs and indigenous communities/boundaries . mentions species too """"This exposes Indigenous coastal communities to a higher risk of accidents, pollution, noise, invasive species, and disruptions to subsistence hunting areas, wildlife reproduction, populations, and migration routes (Huntington et al., 2015; ICC-Alaska, 2015; Meredith et al., 2019)."""" ; ","Biophysical; Human movement; IK; save for other sections",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

J.","Canada yew (Taxus canadensis Marsh.) is a shade-tolerant evergreen shrub native to the understories of the boreal and deciduous forests of northeastern North America. Canada yew has a relatively unique growth form, with low sprawling branches capable of forming dense clusters of stems. Historic accounts suggest that before Euro-American settlement, Canada yew was a common plant across its range in many forest types and that it was locally abundant or dominant in 5%-20% of forest stands in the northern part of its range. Canada yew's range has declined during the last century as a result of browsing by native ungulates, fire, intensive forest management, and clearing of land for agriculture and other development. It is considered uncommon throughout most of its present North American range, except for often isolated populations in areas that remain free from heavy browsing pressure by moose and deer (e.g., islands, areas with heavy snow cover, or areas naturally low in ungulate abundance). Its decline has likely resulted in changes to abiotic and biotic conditions, including structure and composition of understory vegetation and concomitant effects on understory vertebrates. Increasing white-tailed deer populations and reduced snowfall as a result of climate change in eastern North America threaten to extirpate this species from additional parts of its range in the next century.

D.; Vincent, W. F.; Wookey, P. A.","Numerous international scientific assessments and related articles have, during the last decade, described the observed and potential impacts of climate change as well as other related environmental stressors on Arctic ecosystems. There is increasing recognition that observed and projected changes in freshwater sources, fluxes, and storage will have profound implications for the physical, biogeochemical, biological, and ecological processes and properties of Arctic terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. However, a significant level of uncertainty remains in relation to forecasting the impacts of an intensified hydrological regime and related cryospheric change on ecosystem structure and function. As the terrestrial and freshwater ecology component of the Arctic Freshwater Synthesis, we review these uncertainties and recommend enhanced coordinated circumpolar research and monitoring efforts to improve quantification and prediction of how an altered hydrological regime influences local, regional, and circumpolar-level responses in terrestrial and freshwater systems. Specifically, we evaluate (i) changes in ecosystem productivity; (ii) alterations in ecosystem-level biogeochemical cycling and chemical transport; (iii) altered landscapes, successional trajectories, and creation of new habitats; (iv) altered seasonality and phenological mismatches; and (v) gains or losses of species and associated trophic interactions. We emphasize the need for developing a process-based understanding of interecosystem interactions, along with improved predictive models. We recommend enhanced use of the catchment scale as an integrated unit of study, thereby more explicitly considering the physical, chemical, and ecological processes and fluxes across a full freshwater continuum in a geographic region and spatial range of hydroecological units (e.g., stream-pond-lake-river-near shore marine environments).",2016,"MAR","JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES","121","3","650-674","WOS:000374345000005","10.1002/2015JG003133","","#13307","Wrona 2016","","Biophysical; Intervention",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

X.; Wang, F. Y.; Feng, X. B.","Mercury (Hg) is a toxic metal that can be released from natural and anthropogenic processes. Gaseous elemental Hg is the main form of Hg in the atmosphere with a long residence time, allowing its long-range transport and deposition at a global scale. The deposited Hg can be transformed into methylmercuy (MeHg), which bioaccumulates and biomagnifies in aquatic ecosystems and is a known developmental neurotoxin to humans. Chronic exposure in pregnant women via fish consumption, even at the modest levels, can impact intellectual development in infants, which is considered as a global environmental health issue. To protect human health and the environment, the Minamata Convention on Mercury, a legally binding international treaty, entered into force in 2017 to reduce anthropogenic emissions and releases of Hg and Hg compounds. With the enforcement of the Convention, anthropogenic Hg emissions and releases are projected to decrease in the foreseeable future, but the recovery of the ecosystem and mitigation of health impact from Hg pollution are expected to lag behind. In this paper, we provide a critical review on the processes affecting when and to which extent Hg-affected ecosystems will recover under the Minamata Convention in the context of climate change and associated human health benefit. Our review is organized around seven major scientific questions. These seven questions covered historical Hg change in the ecosystem, major factors and processes, and future assessment. The impact of implementation of Minamata Convention and climate change on Hg emission, atmospheric transportation and deposition, biota accumulation, and human exposure should be comprehensively evaluated. The Hg stable isotope tool and process-based integrated global model should be integrated together, which also should consider future global social-economic pathways and mitigation options.

J.","Here, we summarize results of migrant bird research in the Caribbean as part of a 75th Anniversary Symposium on research of the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service, International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF). The fate of migratory birds has been a concern stimulating research over the past 40 years in response to population declines documented in long-term studies including those of the IITF and collaborators in Puerto Rico's Guanica dry forest. Various studies indicate that in addition to forest loss or fragmentation, some migrant declines may be due to rainfall variation, the consequences of which may carry over from one stage of a migrant's annual cycle to another. For example, the Guanica studies indicate that rainfall extremes on either the temperate breeding or tropical wintering grounds affect migrant abundance and survival differently depending on the species. In contrast, IITF's collaborative studies of the migrant Kirtland's Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) in the Bahamas found that late winter droughts affect its annual survival and breeding success in Michigan. We review these IITF migrant studies and relate them to other studies, which have improved our understanding of migrant ecology of relevance to conservation. Particularly important is the advent of the full annual cycle (FAC) approach. The FAC will facilitate future identification and mitigation of limiting factors contributing to migrant population declines, which for some species, may be exacerbated by global climate change.",2017,"APR","Forests","8","4","","WOS:000404099200021","10.3390/f8040115","","#13361","Wunderle 2017","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Y.","Geopolitics of energy transition has increasingly become the frontier and hot research area of world energy geography and global political science. Different historical periods are characterised by obvious differences in energy connotations, attributes, and geopolitical characteristics. In the new energy era, energy geopolitics becomes more diversified, complex, and comprehensive. In this paper, we compare the geopolitical characteristics of energy in the fossil fuel and renewable energy periods, and provide an overview of current study trends in new energy geopolitics. Recent research shows that the global energy transition will intensify the reconstruction of geopolitical patterns, change the relationship between geopolitical security and conflict dominated by traditional energy security, alter the role of different countries in global energy geopolitical games, reshape national energy relationships formed in the traditional oil and gas era. In addition, geopolitics will be affected by new energy technologies, availability of key rare materials, and energy cybersecurity measures. Despite considerable attention to this research topic, the likely geopolitical impact of energy transition remains uncertain, and there is still room for the development and improvement of the theoretical framework, technical methods, and research perspective. Looking forward to the future, the research into geopolitics of energy transition urgently needs to strengthen its theoretical basis and rely on the scientific and quantitative methods. The practical conclusions of the research into geopolitics of energy transition should strengthen major national energy security decisions, explore the geographical effect of energy transition, and determine the impact of energy transition on energy security.

I.; Arrieta, H.","The Western honey bee Apis mellifera is a managed species that provides diverse hive products and contributing to wild plant pollination, as well as being a critical component of crop pollination systems worldwide. High mortality rates have been reported in different continents attributed to different factors, including pesticides, pests, diseases, and lack of floral resources. Furthermore, climate change has been identified as a potential driver negatively impacting pollinators, but it is still unclear how it could affect honey bee populations. In this context, we carried out a systematic review to synthesize the effects of climate change on honey bees and beekeeping activities. A total of 90 articles were identified, providing insight into potential impacts (negative, neutral, and positive) on honey bees and beekeeping. Interest in climate change's impact on honey bees has increased in the last decade, with studies mainly focusing on honey bee individuals, using empirical and experimental approaches, and performed at short-spatial (<10 km) and temporal (<5 years) scales. Moreover, environmental analyses were mainly based on short-term data (weather) and concentrated on only a few countries. Environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind were widely studied and had generalized negative effects on different biological and ecological aspects of honey bees. Food reserves, plant-pollinator networks, mortality, gene expression, and metabolism were negatively impacted. Knowledge gaps included a lack of studies at the apiary and beekeeper level, a limited number of predictive and perception studies, poor representation of large-spatial and mid-term scales, a lack of climate analysis, and a poor understanding of the potential impacts of pests and diseases. Finally, climate change's impacts on global beekeeping are still an emergent issue. This is mainly due to their diverse effects on honey bees and the potential necessity of implementing adaptation measures to sustain this activity under complex environmental scenarios.",2024,"MAR","Global Change Biology","30","3","","WOS:001180804300001","10.1111/gcb.17219","","#13708","Zapata-Hernández 2024","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This review thus examined about 312 watersheds worldwide to provide a generalized framework to evaluate hydrological responses to forest cover change and to identify the contribution of spatial scale, climate, forest type and hydrological regime in determining the intensity of forest change related hydrological responses in small (<1000 km(2)) and large watersheds ( >= 1000 km(2)). Key findings include: (1) the increase in annual runoff associated with forest cover loss is statistically significant at multiple spatial scales whereas the effect of forest cover gain is statistically inconsistent; (2) the sensitivity of annual runoff to forest cover change tends to attenuate as watershed size increases only in large watersheds; (3) annual runoff is more sensitive to forest cover change in water-limited watersheds than in energy-limited watersheds across all spatial scales; and (4) small mixed forest-dominated watersheds or large snow-dominated watersheds are more hydrologically resilient to forest cover change. These findings improve the understanding of hydrological response to forest cover change at different spatial scales and provide a scientific underpinning to future watershed management in the context of climate change and increasing anthropogenic disturbances.

This is especially important for proactive management of zoonotic parasites such as Echinococcus multilocularis, the etiologic agent of alveolar echinococcosis. Echinococcus multilocularis has a Holarctic distribution; with its geographic range and prevalence increasing recently in areas of the western Palearctic, while its distribution dynamics are poorly understood in the Nearctic. In this paper, we use an ecological niche modeling (ENM) approach to: i) estimate the current spatial distribution of suitable conditions for the parasite in the Nearctic. ii) Evaluate the abiotic and biotic factors influencing the species distribution. iii) Assess the potential impact of climatic change on the distribution of this species in the Nearctic. Additionally, we report two new occurrence records of this parasite that significantly expands its known geographic range. We reviewed the occurrence records of E. multilocularis for the Nearctic. This was complemented by two new records of the species from Maryland and New Mexico identified using morphology and multivariate morphometrics of the rostellar hooks. From these data we created two ENMs using the software Maxent. The first ENM included climatic variables, while the second included the same abiotic data plus biotic information consisting of four host community-related data sets. We evaluated model performance and variable importance to explore the relation of these variables to the parasite niche. Finally, we projected the resulting niche model onto future climate change scenarios. We found that an important portion of the Nearctic has suitable conditions for E. multilocularis with adequate habitat in the West and East of the continent where the parasite has not been detected. We also found that the proposed biotic variables improve the model performance and provide unique information, while the most critical abiotic variable was related to the amount of solar radiation. Finally, under the future emission scenarios explored, the distribution of suitable habitat for the parasite is predicted to increase by 56 % to 76 %. We obtained a robust model that provides detail on the distribution of suitable areas for E. multilocularis, including areas that have not been explored for the presence of the parasite.

Discarded products from landfills and dumpsites are potential sources of POPs due to their persistence for several decades and constant release to surrounding environment. POPs in aquatic systems signal input predominantly from landfills, wastewater treatment plants, sewage, and urban runoff, suggesting a research gap to guide policies to address these unabated releases. This scoping review aims to rapidly identify the key concepts underpinning the containment, translation, and migration of POPs in Canadian and US landfill leachate. The review targeted multidisciplinary perspectives on the topic and spanned forensic biology, environmental sciences, chemistry, and geology. Contaminated municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill characteristics, as reported by government agencies in Canada and the US, were synthesized and harmonized to illustrate the geographical scope of MSW landfills releasing POPs into the surrounding environment. The knowledge and data gaps summarized in this study highlight the need to address the inadvertent release of POPs from Canadian and US landfills, particularly in consideration of dated and degrading landfill infrastructure, the proximity of marginalized people, and the implications of climate change on the countries' more vulnerable landscapes.

Four conservation and restoration principles for whitebark pine were previously emphasized: (1) conserve genetic diversity, (2) promote WPBR resistance, (3) protect seed sources, and (4) deploy restoration treatments, while mitigating for climate change. These principles are served by ten additional management or conservation actions that form the basis of a restoration and adaptive management plan but apply primarily to regions with moderate to high levels of WPBR and MPB outbreaks. Where the pathogen and MPB are absent or present at low levels, managers can implement proactive management to build resilience to prevent the future loss of ecological function. Here, we review the key management actions currently used for whitebark pine conservation and restoration in the U.S. and Canada, which include gene conservation, increasing natural genetic resistance to C. ribicola, cone collections, growing and planting seedlings or directly sowing seeds, protecting seed sources, prescribed fire and silvicultural thinning to reduce competition in late seral communities, proactive intervention, stand health surveys and monitoring, and monitoring the impacts of restoration for adaptive management. This review is the outcome of an experts' workshop held in association with the development of the National Whitebark Pine Restoration Plan (NWPRP), a collaborative U.S. multi-agency and tribal effort initiated in 2017 in consultation with the U.S. Forest Service and facilitated by the non-profit organizations, the Whitebark Pine Ecosystem Foundation and American Forests.",2022,"/","Forest Ecology and Management.","522","","","","10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119929","IND607588854","#14481","Tomback 2022","Colleen Miller (2024-08-23 00:47:14)(Select): discuss various ways pine is attacked (spread of beetles, fires) in US and CAN, and how people are managing pines; ","Potentially relevant; Sociocultural",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Bradley; Jensen, Paul G.; Fisher, Jason T.","Competition is a major determinant of where species occur and how species interact. Among carnivorans, interspecific competition is particularly apparent, as many of these species have evolved to be efficient killers. Theoretically, phylogenetically related carnivorans that occupy seasonal habitats, share common resources, and differ in body size by a factor of 2.5-10x should exhibit the most interference competition. Fishers Pekania pennanti and martens Martes americana and Martes caurina are members of the subfamily Guloninae (Mustelidae, Carnivora) that occupy forests throughout northern North America. These taxa occur sympatrically throughout much of their range, utilise similar habitats, and consume similar prey; fishers and martens also differ in body size by a factor 2-5x. Consequently, these two taxa appear to be locked in particularly strong interspecific competition and should attempt to limit competitive overlap. We review the current knowledge of this dyadic interaction in the framework of ecological niches and niche partitioning. In particular, we explore the three critical niche axes of diet, space, and time. We found that, in contrast to the traditional view of them being highly specialised, both martens and fishers are dietary generalists; however, they also appear to be specialists in complexity, at least in space and habitats. Collectively, martens and fishers exhibit high degrees of diet and habitat niche overlap across their ranges, and this overlap is likely to have the greatest fitness consequences for the smaller and subordinate martens. Nevertheless, fine-scale habitat and prey partitioning, and especially partitioning along snow clines, seem to be the mechanisms by which these two taxa can coexist. We predict that rapid ecological change - especially from increasingly homogenised forests and prey communities, as well as from declining snow cover and snowpack due to climate warming - is likely to destabilise marten-fisher coexistence. As the climate continues to change, fishers and martens are likely to experience distributional and numerical shifts and increased isolation at their southern range boundaries, and vulnerable populations - especially of martens - will be driven to local extirpation.

It is a cosmopolitan species with a geographical range that includes the coastlines of all major ocean basins (Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean). As a consequence, freshwater occurrences of C. leucas are possible everywhere inside its geographic range. Carcharhinus leucas is a fully euryhaline, amphidromous species and possibly the widest-ranging of all freshwater tolerating elasmobranchs. This species is found not only in river systems with sea access that are not interrupted by human impediments but in hypersaline lakes as well. Rivers and estuaries are believed to be important nursery grounds for C. leucas, as suggested by observations of pregnant females in estuaries and neonates with umbilical scars in rivers and river mouths. Due to the physical capability of this species to enter riverine systems, the documentation of its occurrence in fresh and brackish water is essential for future conservation plans, fishery inspections, and scientific studies that focus on the link between low salinity habitats, shark nurseries, and feeding areas. The author's review of the available literature on C. leucas revealed the absence of a comprehensive overview of fresh and brackish water localities (rivers and associated lakes, estuaries) with C. leucas records. The purpose of this literature review is to provide a global list of rivers, river systems, lakes, estuaries, and lagoons with records and reports of this species, including a link to the used references as a base for regional, national, and international conservation strategies. Therefore, the objective of this work is to present lists of fresh and brackish water habitats with records of C. leucas as the result of an extensive literature review and analysis of databases. This survey also took into account estuaries and lagoons, regarding their function as important nursery grounds for C. leucas. The analysis of references included is not only from the scientific literature, but also includes semi-scientific references and the common press if reliable. The result of 415 global fresh and brackish water localities with evidence of C. leucas highlights the importance of these habitats for the reproduction of this species. Moreover, gaps in available distribution maps are critically discussed as well as interpretations and conclusions made regarding possible reasons for the distribution range of C. leucas, which can be interpreted as the result of geographic circumstances, but also as a result of the current state of knowledge about the distribution of this species. The results of the examination of available references were used to build a reliable and updated distribution map for C. leucas, which is also presented here.",2021,"/","Stuttgarter Beitrage zur Naturkunde.","4","1","55-213","","10.18476/2021.423083","IND607619000","#14564","Gausmann 2021","Colleen Miller (2024-08-29 04:57:51)(Select): notes transboundary populations; northward shifts in range due to cc;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Borrelia burgdorferi is a bacterial species that causes an emerging zoonotic tick-borne disease known as Lyme borreliosis. The role of ticks in the transmission of this pathogen was explored in this study. According to this systematic review, undertaken according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 19 tick species are known to carry Borrelia burgdorferi, with more than half of the recorded cases in the last two decades related to Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes scapularis ticks. Forty-six studies from four continents, Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa, reported this pathogen in ticks collected from vegetation, animals, and humans. This study highlights an increasing distribution of tick-associated Borrelia burgdorferi, likely driven by accelerated tick population increases in response to climate change coupled with tick dispersal via migratory birds. This updated catalogue helps in compiling all tick species responsible for the transmission of B. burgdorferi across the globe.

The influence of these nonrandom changes in species distributions could profoundly affect the functioning of ecosystems and the essential services that they provide. However, few experimental tests have been conducted examining the influence of species invasions on ecosystem functioning. Even fewer have been conducted using invasive ecosystem engineers, which can have disproportionately strong influence on native ecosystems relative to their own biomass. The invasion of exotic earthworms is a prime example of an ecosystem engineer that is influencing many ecosystems around the world. In particular, European earthworm invasions of northern North American forests cause simultaneous species gains and losses with significant consequences for essential ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling and crucial services to humanity like soil erosion control and carbon sequestration. Exotic earthworms are expected to select for specific traits in communities of soil microorganisms (fast-growing bacteria species), soil fauna (promoting the bacterial energy channel), and plants (graminoids) through direct and indirect effects. This will accelerate some ecosystem processes and decelerate others, fundamentally altering how invaded forests function. This project aims to investigate ecosystem responses of northern North American forests to earthworm invasion. Using a novel, synthetic combination of field observations, field experiments, lab experiments, and meta-analyses, the proposed work will be the first systematic examination of earthworm effects on (1) plant communities and (2) soil food webs and processes. Further, (3) effects of a changing climate (warming and reduced summer precipitation) on earthworm performance will be investigated in a unique field experiment designed to predict the future spread and consequences of earthworm invasion in North America. By assessing the soil chemical and physical properties as well as the taxonomic (e.g., by the latest next-generation sequencing techniques) and functional composition of plant, soil microbial and animal communities and the processes they drive in four forests, work packages I-III take complementary approaches to derive a comprehensive and generalizable picture of how ecosystems change in response to earthworm invasion. Finally, in work package IV, meta-analyses will be used to integrate the information from work packages I-III and existing literature to investigate if earthworms cause invasion waves, invasion meltdowns, habitat homogenization, and ecosystem state shifts. Global data will be synthesized to test if the relative magnitude of effects differs from place to place depending on the functional dissimilarity between native soil fauna and exotic earthworms. Moving from local to global scale, the present proposal examines the influence of earthworm invasions on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships from an aboveground-belowground perspective in natural settings. This approach is highly innovative as it utilizes the invasion by exotic earthworms as an exciting model system that links invasion biology with trait-based community ecology, global change research, and ecosystem ecology, pioneering a new generation of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research.

A rangewide whitebark pine restoration strategy (Keane et al. 2012b) was developed recently to inform restoration efforts for whitebark pine across Federal, State, and Provincial land management agencies.

This mosquito, similar to other Stegomyia species such as Aedes aegypti (L.), is highly adapted to urban and suburban areas, and commonly oviposits in artificial containers, which are ubiquitous in these peridomestic environments. The increase in speed and amount of international travel and commerce, coupled with global climate change, have aided in the resurgence and expansion of Stegomyia species into new areas of North America. In many parts of their range, both species are implicated as significant vectors of emerging and re-emerging arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and now Zika. Although rapid and major advances have been made in the field of biology, ecology, genetics, taxonomy, and virology, relatively little has changed in the field of mosquito control in recent decades. This is particularly discouraging in regards to container-inhabiting mosquitoes, because traditional integrated mosquito management (IMM) approaches have not been effective against these species. Many mosquito control programs simply do not possess the man-power or necessary financial resources needed to suppress Ae. albopictus effectively. Therefore, control of mosquito larvae, which is the foundation of IMM approaches, is exceptionally difficult over large areas. This review paper addresses larval habitats, use of geographic information systems for habitat preference detection, door-to-door control efforts, source reduction, direct application of larvicides, biological control agents, area-wide low-volume application of larvicides, hot spot treatments, autodissemination stations, public education, adult traps, attractive-toxic sugar bait methods, lethal ovitraps, barrier-residual adulticides, hand-held ultra-low-volume adulticides, area-wide adulticides applied by ground or air, and genetic control methods.

Warmer temperatures are expected to increase disease risks from food-borne pathogens, water-borne diseases, and vector-borne zoonoses in human and animal populations of Arctic landscapes. Existing high levels of mercury and persistent organic pollutant chemicals circulating within terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in Arctic latitudes are a major concern for the reproductive health of humans and other mammals, and climate warming will accelerate the mobilization and biological amplification of toxic environmental contaminants. The adverse health impacts of Arctic warming will be especially important for wildlife populations and indigenous peoples dependent upon subsistence food resources from wild plants and animals. Additional research is needed to identify and monitor changes in the prevalence of zoonotic pathogens in humans, domestic dogs, and wildlife species of critical subsistence, cultural, and economic importance to Arctic peoples.

In this paper, we discuss ecological patterns and processes in roadside habitats important for understanding the invasion dynamics of common reed from coastal areas inland. Frequent disturbances in roadsides combined with potentially high levels of nutrients from adjacent land and stress conditions (from deicing salt and other pollutants) mimic the conditions unfortunately found more and more in natural wetlands. The novel contribution of roads is the creation of linear wetlands with an unprecedented level of connectivity. Genetic evidence shows that invasion inland coincides with the intensification of the road network. Time series analysis of remote sensing data reveals impressive rates of invasion of roadsides and other linear infrastructures, suggesting prime conditions for common reed in these novel habitats. Whereas reed dispersal along roads was thought to be largely due to rhizome transport, new evidence suggests a significant contribution of sexual reproduction and seedling establishment, likely enhanced by climate warming at northern latitudes. There is little evidence that other wetland plants can slow down vegetative expansion of common reed in roadside habitats, but plant cover could prevent seedling establishment and shading by shrubs and trees limit lateral clonal expansion. The fact that common reed possibly provides water treatment and other ecosystem services in roadsides must be carefully weighed against the threat to biodiversity in natural systems. All this begs for investigating urgently if, where, and how we should intervene without compromising the great value of wetlands of conservation interest intersected by roads.",2010,"/","Invasive plant science and management.","3","4","506-514","","10.1614/IPSM-09-050.1","IND44475723","#15378","Brisson 2010","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Evidence from research on northeastern North American forests shows that direct effects of climate change will evoke changes in biogeochemical cycling by altering plant physiology, forest productivity, and soil physical, chemical, and biological processes. Indirect effects, largely mediated by changes in species composition, length of growing season, and hydrology, will also be important. The case study presented here uses the quantitative biogeochemical model PnET-BGC to test assumptions about the direct and indirect effects of climate change on a northern hardwood forest ecosystem. Modeling results indicate an overall increase in net primary production due to a longer growing season, an increase in NO3- leaching due to large increases in net mineralization and nitrification, and slight declines in mineral weathering due to a reduction in soil moisture.

We present a conceptual framework using one system as a model, emphasizing interactions across levels of biological hierarchy and spatiotemporal scales. Bark beetles are major natural disturbance agents in western North American forests. However, recent bark beetle population eruptions have exceeded the frequencies, impacts, and ranges documented during the previous 125 years. Extensive host abundance and susceptibility, concentrated beetle density, favorable weather, optimal symbiotic associations, and escape from natural enemies must occur jointly for beetles to surpass a series of thresholds and exert widespread disturbance. Opposing feedbacks determine qualitatively distinct outcomes at junctures at the biochemical through landscape levels. Eruptions occur when key thresholds are surpassed, prior constraints cease to exert influence, and positive feedbacks amplify across scales. These dynamics are bidirectional, as landscape features influence how lower-scale processes are amplified or buffered. Climate change and reduced habitat heterogeneity increase the likelihood that key thresholds will be exceeded, and may cause fundamental regime shifts. Systems in which endogenous feedbacks can dominate after external forces foster the initial breach of thresholds appear particularly sensitive to anthropogenic perturbations.",2008,"/","BioScience.","","","501-517","","10.1641/B580607","IND44071925","#15461","Raffa 2008","Anabel Kinsey (2024-09-04 09:19:50)(Select): I couldn't find a specific temporal example of a flow, but I think this has a lot of potential!

In this communication we show that boreal forest nations are a disparate grouping, with some similarities and many differences. Highlighting these differing national contexts provides insights into how a given nation utilizes the boreal forests over which it holds stewardship responsibilities. Current national contexts are related to each nation's physiography, climate, history, legacy of past forest management, the timing of transition from natural to plantation forests, population density and distribution, and access to resources and markets. Boreal forests are dominated by pioneer species that are resilient to disturbance and have a demonstrated ability to adapt to past climate changes. National responses to natural disturbances are linked to forest area, ownership, and management intensity. Boreal forests in large nations (e.g., Canada, Russian Federation) are typically publicly owned, and disturbances such as fire are allowed to progress naturally over remote areas. In smaller nations, where there is often a greater proportion of private ownership and a focus on production forestry, natural disturbances are more aggressively controlled (e.g., Sweden, Finland). Large nations with low boreal human population densities have a greater proportion of natural boreal forest, with relatively higher levels of biodiversity when compared to the fully managed forests of some smaller boreal nations. In smaller nations, the combination of limited forest area and private ownership has facilitated the dominance of intensive sustainable forestry management practices (e.g., Finland). Conversely, in nations with more spatially extensive forest assets that are publicly owned and managed to meet multiple objectives, extensive sustainable forest management practices dominate (e.g., Canada, Russian Federation).",2007,"/","Forestry chronicle.","83","4","539-556","","10.5558/tfc83539-4","IND44053595","#15488","Wulder 2007","Colleen Miller (2024-08-23 01:16:47)(Select): Transboundary implicit; discusses some flows related to forests such as the movement of pollutants and fires;","Intervention; Perspective paper; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

C.; Scarr, T.; Ter-Mikaelian, M. T.; Flannigan, M. D.","This report reviews literature concerning the effects of global climate change on forest plants and communities and discusses the potential impacts climate change may have on the forests of Ontario (Canada). There are 10 chapters by different authors, and introductory and concluding sections. There is growing evidence that environmental changes caused by increased atmospheric CO2 and its potential effects on global climate will alter forest ecosystems in Ontario. A doubling of CO2 from pre-industrial levels is expected to occur within 80 yr. Increased CO2 may increase average summer temperatures in Ontario between 3 and 6 degrees C, with the largest increases in NW and S. Ontario. Precipitation is predicted to increase in NE Ontario, but to decrease in S. and NW Ontario. An increase in summer temperatures with no or little increase in precipitation would increase the frequency and severity of drought by increasing evapotranspiration. Also, extreme weather events and variation in weather are expected to increase. The length of the forest fire season is expected to increase with longer growing seasons, and increased moisture loss from forests due to increased temperatures would increase forest fire frequency and severity. Increases in drought stress could also increase the frequency of major forest insect and disease outbreaks. Increases in forest fires, insect outbreaks and diseases would, in turn, alter the age structure and species in forest ecosystems, with the greatest impacts expected in NW and S. Ontario. Extreme weather events could further damage or stress plants. Increased CO2, drought, and temperature will affect the growth and survival of plants by altering their physiological behaviour. The genetic structure of plant populations may be affected by altered selection pressures, and species with larger genetic variability are likely to be more adaptable to changed climatic conditions and may be more successful. Competitive abilities of plant species now present in Ontario's forests may change, with some species becoming more competitive and others less so. Productivity and timber supply in NW and S. Ontario may decline due to increases in drought, forest fires, insects and disease, although this may be partially offset by increases in growth rates accompanying higher CO2 levels, warmer temperatures, and a longer growing season. Increases in precipitation in NE Ontario along with higher CO2 levels, increased temperatures and longer growing season could significantly increase productivity and timber supply. Over hundreds of years, plant species may migrate northward. Differing migration rates and the species' reactions to new environmental conditions could result in new plant species mixes for which forest management experience is lacking. However, forest management through changed silvicultural and harvesting practices could reduce the impacts of climatic change to forests. Climatic adaptation could also be increased through tree breeding, and carbon sequestration could become a goal of forest management.",1998,"","Forest Research Information Paper - Ontario Forest Research Institute","","143","v-pp","","","","#15705","Colombo 1998","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-09-01 00:51:18)(Select): study is geographically focused on Ontario but discusses some transboundary locations like the Great Lakes system that could be relevant to the chapter ;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

"353","The impact of climate change on countries' interdependence on genetic resources for food and agriculture","Fujisaka, S.; Williams, D.; Halewood, M.","In many parts of the world, climate change rates will likely exceed the adaptive capacity of a broad range of crop and forage varieties, animal breeds, and tree populations used in agricultural production systems. The evidence with respect to the relative adaptive capacity of beneficial microbes and aquaculture species is less conclusive but points in the same direction. This mismatch between climate change rates and adaptive capacities will require adaptations of production systems. As part of their strategies to adapt, countries will need still more outside sources of diversity of the same species, or new species entirely. This finding is based on the assumption that countries will seek to maintain agricultural production in areas currently being farmed. It is possible, of course, that in some areas environmental and related biotic stresses will be such that agriculture will have to be abandoned altogether. Interdependence on germplasm of crops will perhaps continue to be at higher levels than other GRFA, with existing, well documented levels of countries' dependence on each others' germplasm being still further augmented. The impact of climate change vis-a-vis pathogenic microbes is, in some respects, the corollary of its impact on crops, forage, animals, and trees. Climate change will provide opportunities for pathogenic microbes (and their insect vectors) to thrive in parts of the world where, previously, they have had no, or only limited, impact. The effect will be to augment the dependence of countries on genetic resources from beyond their borders - in this case, as sources of genetic resistance to novel pests and diseases or to bio-control agents. Climate change is increasing countries' interdependence on GRFA. This increased interdependence means there will be an increased need for international movements of GRFA to meet agricultural production challenges associated with climate change. It is important for policy makers to consider the importance of these international movements of GRFA when considering options for access and benefit sharing norms.",2010,"","Background Study Paper (FAO)","","48","ii-pp","","","","#15750","Fujisaka 2010","","",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This paper reviews existing impacts, projected impacts, and management options for Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock) forests in US national parks threatened by the introduced insect Adelges tsugae (Hemlock Woolly Adelgid [HWA]). Eighty-five national parks, or 21% of all parks in the US national park system, are encompassed within the range of Eastern Hemlock. These 85 parks include iconic areas such as national battlefields and the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. Four focal parks of this study - Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Shenandoah National Park, and New River Gorge National River - are collectively visited by 16 million people annually and Eastern Hemlock is a forest component in 2-26% of their area. Results of research on HWA impacts to forest species composition, soil nutrient cycling, watersheds and fisheries, wildlife habitat, and visitor experiences and safety have already been reported from these parks. A general principle is that after Eastern Hemlock forest decline, some species (e.g., some avian species favoring other tree species) benefit, while those associated with Eastern Hemlock must adapt or decline. Forecasting future forest-tree composition is complicated by the fact that: (i) many possible replacement tree species are themselves threatened by introduced damaging agents, (ii) changes hinge upon understory dynamics such as invading exotic plants or expansion of native shrubs, and (iii) this die-off event is occurring within a context of multiple interacting factors such as elevated herbivory, climate change, and atmospheric pollution. Some management strategies for parks include: intensive HWA chemical treatment at priority sites, biocontrol, genetic manipulation for HWA resistance in Eastern Hemlock, exotic plant treatment, facilitated establishment of native vegetation, or doing nothing, the last of which also is likely to result in appreciable forest change.

The apparent emergence of this fungus in another temperate area, this time in the Pacific Northwest, suggests the fungus may have expanded its ecological niche. Yet studies that directly examine the potential roles of climatic and land use changes on C. gattii are still lacking. We aim to summarize the existing global literature on the ecology of C. gattii, with particular focus on the gap in knowledge surrounding the potential effects of climatic and land use changes.

We included studies published from January 1970 through June 2016 and identified 56 relevant studies for our review. We identified environmental isolations of C. gattii from 18 countries, spanning 72 separate regions across six continents. Fifty-three tree species were associated with C. gattii, spanning 10 climate classifications and 36 terrestrial ecoregions. No studies directly tested the potential effects of climatic changes (including climatic oscillations and global climate change) on C. gattii, while only one study directly assessed those of land use change. To improve model predictions of current and future distributions of C. gattii, more focus is needed on the potential effects of climatic and land use changes to help decrease the public health risk.

"359","Saltmarshes in a time of change","Adam, P.; Polunin, N. V. C.","This review discusses the factors that influence the development and future condition and survival of salt marshes. Of critical importance are changes in relative sea level and in tidal range. Relative sea level is affected by changes in absolute sea level, changes in land level and the capacity of salt marshes to accumulate and retain sediment. Many salt marshes are starved of sediment because of catchment modification and coastal engineering, or exposed to erosive forces, which may be natural origin or reflect human interference. Pressures on the environment created by the continued increase in the human population, particularly in developing tropical countries, and the likely consequences of the enhanced greenhouse effect on both temperature and sea level give rise to particular concerns. Humans have modified salt marshes directly and intensively in many ways for a variety of purposes, viz., as a cultural landscape, land claim, evaporative salt production, aquaculture, insect control, tidal power, tidal barriers, water storage, pollution (by oil, industrial chemicals and eutrophication), and introduced species. The impact of these factors on the change of salt marshes in Kent and Essex (southeast England), Morecambe Bay (northwest England) and in Louisiana (USA), as well as the changes in the distribution and abundance of native species are discussed. By 2025, global sea level rise and warming will have impacts on salt marshes.

While the responses of insects to these changes have been increasingly studied, our understanding of how such alterations impact trophic interactions still requires further research to make reliable predictions about the spread of diseases in a warming world. Phytoplasmas, a group of obligate parasitic unculturable Mollicutes, primarily rely on leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) for transmission, spread, and survival. Phytoplasmas are associated with over 600 diseases affecting more than 1,000 plant species, including berries, grapevines, and other small fruits. In North America, diseases such as grapevine yellows, blueberry stunt, and strawberry green petal diseases have been linked to phytoplasma strains transmitted by known leafhopper species. However, the number of phytoplasma diseases has significantly increased in North America over the past decade, suggesting the presence of unidentified vectors or an abundance of leafhopper vectors.

The three countries reflect economic and geographic diversity in Latin America and more than half of the region's population. MAIN FINDINGS: Climate change impacts tend to be relatively small at an economywide level in all three countries. However, sectoral and household-level economic impacts tend to be diverse across countries and subnational levels. They mainly depend on projected changes in agricultural yields, the share of agriculture in regional gross domestic product (GDP), crop-specific international trade balances, net food buyer/seller position, and income diversification of households. As for gender, results from this study suggest that female-headed households may be less vulnerable than male-headed households to the effects of climate change, highlighting the importance of considering women as a source for solutions for building resilience to climate change. Given the relatively small impacts of climate change and the degree of uncertainty associated with them, it is too early to define specific policy recommendations.

We compiled a list of 124 Oaks of Concern based on the Red List of Oaks 2020 and the Conservation Gap Analysis for Native U.S. Oaks and their evaluations of each species. Of these, 57% have been the subject of some genetic analysis, but for most threatened species (72%), the only genetic analysis was done as part of a phylogenetic study. While nearly half (49%) of published genetic studies involved population genetic analysis, only 16 species of concern (13%) have been the subject of these studies. This is a critical gap considering that analysis of intraspecific genetic variability and genetic structure are essential for designing conservation management strategies. We review the published population genetic studies to highlight their application to conservation. Finally, we discuss future directions in Quercus conservation genetics and genomics.",2021,"","Forests","12","7","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f12070882","","#16348","Backs 2021","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

R.","Ecosystems across the United States are changing in complex and unpredictable ways and analysis of these changes requires coordinated, long-term research. This paper is a product of a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation funded Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network addressing the LTER core research area of """"populations and communities."""" This analysis revealed that each LTER site had at least one compelling """"story"""" about what their site would look like in 50-100 yr. As the stories were prepared, themes emerged, and the stories were group into papers along five themes: state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects. This paper addresses the cascading effects theme and includes stories from the Bonanza Creek (boreal), Kellogg Biological Station (agricultural and freshwater), Palmer (Antarctica), and Harvard Forest (temperate forest) LTER sites. We define cascading effects very broadly to include a wide array of unforeseen chains of events that result from a variety of actions or changes in a system. While climate change is having important direct effects on boreal forests, indirect effects mediated by fire activity-severity, size, and return interval-have large cascading effects over the long term. In northeastern temperate forests, legacies of human management and disturbance affect the composition of current forests, which creates a cascade of effects that interact with the climate-facilitated invasion of an exotic pest. In Antarctica, declining sea ice creates a cascade of effects including declines in Adelie and increases in Gentoo penguins, changes in phytoplankton, and consequent changes in zooplankton populations. An invasion of an exotic species of lady beetle is likely to have important future effects on pest control and conservation of native species in agricultural landscapes. New studies of zebra mussels, a well-studied invader, have established links between climate, the heat tolerance of the mussels, and harmful algal blooms. Collectively, these stories highlight the need for long-term studies to sort out the complexities of different types of ecological cascades. The diversity of sites within the LTER network facilitates the emergence of overarching concepts about trophic interactions as an important driver of ecosystem structure, function, services, and futures.",2021,"","Special Feature: Forecasting Earth's ecosystems with long-term ecological research.","12","5","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3430","","#16356","Bahlai 2021","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

We analyzed the effects of temperature anomaly on arrival date and infestation severity of potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae Harris, a classic new world long distance migrant, and a significant pest in several agricultural crops. We compiled E. fabae arrival dates and infestation severity data at different states in USA from existing literature reviews and agricultural extension records from 1951-2012, and examined the influence of temperature anomalies at each target state or overwintering range on the date of arrival and severity of infestation. Average E. fabae arrival date at different states reveal a clear trend along the south-north axis, with earliest arrival closest to the overwintering range. E. fabae arrival has advanced by 10 days over the last 62 years. E. fabae arrived earlier in warmer years in relation to each target state level temperature anomaly (3.0 days/ degrees C increase in temperature anomaly). Increased temperature had a significant and positive effect on the severity of infestation, and arrival date had a marginal negative effect on severity.

R.; Lane, R.; Day, J.; Paerl, H.; Raynie, R.","River systems worldwide have become substantially influenced by human activities, including land use changes, river diversion operations, and flood control measures. Some of the unambiguous and best studied examples of effects of enhanced eutrophication on biotic resources can be found in Louisiana estuaries at the terminus of the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River system. The Mississippi River delta has experienced large losses of coastal wetlands due to a combination of human impacts and sea-level rise. State and Federal agencies are moving ahead with plans for building large-scale river sediment diversions, which will capture maximum sediment during spring flood pulses and direct a sediment subsidy into the eroding coastal basins. These large-scale river sediment diversions will also substantially increase freshwater and nutrient inputs and are likely to affect algal bloom formation, including harmful cyanobacterial blooms. There are concerns that discharge of river water containing high concentrations of N, P and Si may trigger algal blooms in the coastal receiving basins. River sediment diversions, as any other flood pulsing, will likely be disruptive to the coastal ecology and so balancing the benefits of slowing coastal land loss against potential negative effects on water quality remains a formidable management challenge. We review here the physical, chemical and biological factors affecting primary production in shallow coastal systems and provide known data on ecosystem response to freshwater diversions, large and small.

In the eastern boreal forest of Canada, there are two major types of natural disturbances that can generate large amounts of biomass for the production of bioenergy: wildfire and spruce budworm outbreak. For example, the mean burned area between 1970 and 2010 was estimated at 2900 km2 per year. Following such disturbances, typically only trees and stands with a merchantable value, i.e., of acceptable quality for traditional forest products (lumber and pulp) are salvaged. However, adding bioenergy to the potential basket of products may both divert trees of marginal quality and profitability away from traditional products and to bioenergy facilities and lengthen the window of opportunity during which salvage operations can occur. This review shows how the dynamics of wood characteristics of trees affected by natural disturbances can be used to predict through time the basket of wood products that can be taken out of a salvaged stand and ensure the best fit between sources of fibre and types of processing facilities. The most important factors influencing fibre quality include degradation caused by fungi and insects. The most suitable time to salvage trees for the production of lumber in stands killed by either spruce budworm or fire is generally limited to 1-2 years after death. For the production of pulp and paper, trees can usually be salvaged for as long as the wood moisture content remains above the fibre saturation point, but usually is not recommended after 3 or 4 years following death. Thus, past this period, salvaged trees may yield better opportunities for the bioenergy sector. Information on wood as bioenergy feedstock (wood chips, wood pellets and liquid biofuel) highlights the importance of wood chemical components in the chemical reactivity of biofuel. This study offers background knowledge and a framework of analysis that highlights the potential of dead wood from natural disturbances for the production of forest and bioenergy products, which can be further adapted to other regions of the world, building on the Canadian experience of adapting practices to natural disturbances.",2015,"","Forestry (Oxford)","88","3","275-290","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/cpv007","","#16444","Barrette 2015","Tyler McIntosh (2024-09-11 06:45:26)(Select): c1: yes

As temperatures increase in Canada, the environment becomes more suitable for ticks and the season suitable for tick activity lengthens, so tick-borne diseases are likely to become more common in Canada. In addition to Lyme disease, four other tick-borne diseases (TBDs) have started to emerge and are likely to increase: Anaplasmosis; Babesiosis; Powassan virus; and Borrelia miyamotoi disease. Increased temperature increases the survival and activity period of ticks, increases the range of both reservoir and tick hosts (e.g. mice and deer) and increases the duration of the season when people may be exposed to ticks. Other ticks and TBDs may spread into Canada as the climate changes.

As ecosystem engineers, wild pigs are a significant source of disturbance in introduced ecosystems due to their numerous, complex impacts on ecosystem processes. Wild pigs are often found in the resource-rich habitat of coastal forests. Coastal forests are complex, dynamic systems with tremendous biodiversity. Exposed to recurrent disturbances, the biophysical characteristics of coastal forests contribute to their ability to return to their original state post-disturbance. However, compounding disturbances can weaken this ability and threaten the health and function of the ecosystem. In this review, through the model of the forests of the southeastern United States Coastal Plain, we (1) describe conditions found across the forested coastal landscape, (2) describe wild pig disturbance, and (3) discuss how wild pig impacts can add to significant anthropogenic and climate-related disturbances threatening coastal forests.

We present an overview of studies on PCBs in the Arctic and combine these with the findings from ArcRisk - a major European Union-funded project aimed at examining the effects of climate change on the transport of contaminants to and their behaviour of in the Arctic - to provide a case study on the behaviour and impact of PCBs over time in the Arctic. PCBs in the Arctic have shown declining trends in the environment over the last few decades. Atmospheric long-range transport from secondary and primary sources is the major input of PCBs to the Arctic region. Modelling of the atmospheric PCB composition and behaviour showed some increases in environmental concentrations in a warmer Arctic, but the general decline in PCB levels is still the most prominent feature. 'Within-Arctic' processing of PCBs will be affected by climate change-related processes such as changing wet deposition. These in turn will influence biological exposure and uptake of PCBs. The pan-Arctic rivers draining large Arctic/sub-Arctic catchments provide a significant source of PCBs to the Arctic Ocean, although changes in hydrology/sediment transport combined with a changing marine environment remain areas of uncertainty with regard to PCB fate.

The Canadian health burden from waterborne illness is unknown, although it presumably accounts for a significant proportion of enteric illness. Recently, large outbreaks with severe consequences produced by Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Cryptosporidium have alarmed Canadians and brought demands for political action. A concurrent need to understand the health impacts of global climate changes and to develop strategies to prevent or prepare for these has also been recognized. There is mounting evidence that weather is often a factor in triggering waterborne disease outbreaks. A recent study of precipitation and waterborne illness in the United States found that more than half the waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States during the last half century followed a period of extreme rainfall. Projections of international global climate change scenarios suggest that, under conditions of global warming most of Canada may expect longer summers, milder winters, increased summer drought, and more extreme precipitation. Excess precipitation, floods, high temperatures, and drought could affect the risk of waterborne illness in Canada. The existing scientific information regarding most weather-related adverse health impacts and on the impacts of global climate change on health in Canada is insufficient for informed decision making.

Billions of birds migrate to and from the boreal region and reproduce in the short boreal summers, largely because of the region's abundant wetlands and undammed waterways. The prodigious number of insects hatched from the water, and creatures living in it, are staples of birds' diets. This watery habitat provides shelter and nesting grounds as well as food for migrants. It has also, until recently, contributed to keeping industrial development in check. But the boreal forest is under pressure from industrial development and climate change. Hydropower has flooded former habitat, while logging and industry such as tar sands oil extraction, strip-mining, and drilling operations have impacted forest habitat and decreased water quality. Climate change is melting permafrost, desiccating wetlands, and potentially creating ecological imbalances that could undermine the land's ability to support the large percentage of the world's bird populations that depend on the boreal forest.

The goal is to document how different attributes of water quality are sensitive to these drivers, to characterize future risk, to inform management responses, and to identify research needs to fill gaps in our understanding. Results suggest that anticipated future changes present a risk of water quality and ecosystem degradation in many United States locations. Understanding responses is, however, complicated by inherent high spatial and temporal variability, interactions with land use and water management, and dependence on uncertain changes in hydrology in response to future climate. Effects on pollutant loading in different watershed settings generally correlate with projected changes in precipitation and runoff. In all regions, increased heavy precipitation events are likely to drive more episodic pollutant loading to water bodies. The risk of algal blooms could increase due to an expanded seasonal window of warm water temperatures and the potential for episodic increases in nutrient loading.

A.","As a headwaters region, Colorado is a critical source of water for surrounding states and Mexico. But fuel densification and shifts in hydrometeorological processes, such as climate aridification and precipitation sharpening, are causing increasingly severe and erratic wildfire behavior and post-disturbance geomorphic hazards in and downstream of its forested source water areas. Human development patterns and inter and intra-state water rights agreements further complicate resource management. This is prompting land managers to consider progressive planning and management tools to mitigate fire-related degradation of water supply and irrigation systems. This narrative review examines aspects of Colorado's geography, demography, and hydrology that make its water supply systems and transfer agreements particularly vulnerable to landscape disturbance and then provides hazard mitigation recommendations.

"383","Ontario's forests and forestry in a changing climate","Colombo, S. J.","This report updates a review of literature about the effects of global climate change on forest plants and communities published ten years ago (Forest Research Information Paper No. 143). Since the previous review, evidence of environmental changes caused by elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and its potential effects on global climate has strengthened considerably, to the point that there are reports that the effects of climate change are already being observed. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicates that rates of greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase due to fossil fuel burning and deforestation. Based on a less-than-worst-case scenario, the IPCC """"A2"""" scenario, and modelled using the Canadian Global Climate Model (CGCM2), increased atmospheric CO2 is projected to increase average summer temperatures in Ontario between 3 degrees C and 6 degrees C by 2070, with the largest increases in the far north but with heavily populated parts of the province warming by 4 degrees C to 5 degrees C. Growing season precipitation is predicted to increase only slightly (<10%) in much of Ontario, and to decrease in southern and northwestern Ontario. Projected increases in summer temperatures with no or little increase in precipitation would increase the frequency and severity of drought by elevating evapotranspiration. One predictable response to drier forests is increased forest area burned. The projected increase is for a doubling of area burned in parts of the province where fire suppression is not practiced. In the managed forest, however, where more people live and where forests are more heavily used for timber production and recreation, most fires are currently able to be suppressed through early action. However, under severe fire weather conditions, initial attack at present can be unsuccessful, and climate change is expected to increase severe fire weather. As a result, an anticipated effect of climate change is increased frequency of uncontainable forest fire spread, resulting in more large burns in areas of managed forest. The complex interactions of trees with insects and disease makes it difficult to project the timing and extent of effects of climate change on these disturbances. However, if drought increases tree stress, the occurrence and severity of insect and disease outbreaks are likely to increase. In addition to drought, extreme weather events, such as wind storms, flooding, and very high temperatures could stress plants and increase insect and disease outbreaks. As a result, most important diseases of Ontario trees are expected to increase, and none are anticipated to decline. Cold winters that have historically kept some insects out of Ontario will occur less frequently, resulting in possible expansions of their ranges. For example, mountain pine beetle, which in recent years expanded its range into boreal forests in northern Alberta, may reach Ontario's pine forests before 2050. Climate change will increasingly make species and local populations of tree species less well adapted to the climate where they occur. For some species, this will reduce growth at the centre of their range and increase growth closer to the northern end of their distribution. The long lives of trees and their slow natural migration means that natural processes will be unable to move seed fast enough to match changing climate. Increasingly, forest managers will consider planting non-local species and populations. Such potential adaptations, however, need to be carried out with consideration of potential negative consequences and if implemented should be well documented and monitored. Risks to forests from implementing adaptation strategies need to be weighed against the risks to forests if chosen actions affect current species biodiversity. For this reason, a coordinated, science-based approach to forest adaptation can help forest managers determine possible strategies for reducing the negative effects of climate change. This report describes an approach termed """"judicious adaptation"""", in which risk of da age from implementing an adaptation is weighed against the risk of not acting. Adaptations carrying high risk would require strong evidence that failing to act creates an imminent threat. Low risk strategies would have a requirement for documentation of results to allow improved understanding of the risks and benefits of undertaking the adaptation. Judicious adaptation has similarities to the adaptive management approach, because of the requirements for planning and monitoring in both. According to the IPCC, sustainable forest management that maintains forest carbon stocks and provides a sustained yield of wood products provides the best long-term climate change mitigation strategy for forests. Wood products from forests store carbon, but also can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels by using wood as an alternative energy source (either burned directly or burning methane generated by wood products in landfills). Solid wood products have considerably lower energy intensity than building materials such as steel, aluminum, brick, and concrete. Therefore, using wood in place of such other materials reduces emissions of greenhouse gases and is an indirect way that forests can contribute to mitigating climate change.",2008,"","Climate Change Research Report - Ontario Forest Research Institute","","CCRR-12","22-pp","","","","#17442","Colombo 2008","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-16 13:30:22)(Select): Lots of explicit discussion of range shifts, especially northward.

P.; Oyama, K.","In forests, trees such as oaks (Quercus spp.) fulfill key ecological functions, including nutrient and water cycling. In the last decades, climate change and its related environmental disturbances have favored the appearance of disease outbreaks caused by plant pathogenic microorganisms. In this context, several root-inhabiting Phytophthora species have emerged as causal agents of """"catastrophic tree mortality"""". A robust body of scientific literature supports the hypothesis for the convergence between Phytophthora and predisposing environmental conditions as warm temperatures, flooding, and drought to establish the optimal conditions for the pathogen proliferation and infection. Due to the climatic alterations and bad agricultural and silvicultural practices tree decline and mortality in extensive zones of forests localized at the Boreal region of America, Asia and Europe, and in Oceania have been observed. Because of global climate change trees have been forced to migrate towards new geographical sites, which in the presence of exotic Phytophthora species have favored the emergence of this pathogen and its outbreaks. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to establish international protocols to avoid pathogen propagation to new sites. In this review, we integrated and discussed state of the art information about the environmental traits and microbial factors that induce forest decline and subsequent tree mortality. Further research directions in the field of Phytophthora - plant interactions with special emphasis on the biochemical and molecular signals involved in pathogen virulence and host defense are suggested.

T.; Hik, D.; Kulkarni, T.; Lewis, G.","Some of the most rapidly changing ecosystems on our planet are located in the polar regions (IPCC 2007; Turner et al. 2009; SWIPA 2011). In some areas of the Arctic and Antarctic, atmospheric temperatures are rising at rates more than double the global average. In addition, there are other direct human impacts on polar regions such as pollution, exploitation and development. Polar ecosystems and the biodiversity they support are already responding to this change and it is expected that even more profound impacts will occur this century. Compounding the risk to polar biodiversity is the fact that many polar ecosystems have limited functional redundancy; in the event of the loss of a single keystone species, they may potentially be exposed to cascading effects and complete ecosystem restructuring (Post et al. 2009). Rapid climate change affecting the polar regions will also have profound physical and ecological consequences for the rest of the planet since the ice-covered Arctic Ocean, the Antarctic continent, and the globally significant Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) serve a key role in regulating the Earth's climate and ocean systems. This special issue is intended to provide an overview of circumpolar change that crosses disciplines, systems, taxonomic groups and regions, and integrates papers that address a range of topics including: the monitoring of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial organisms in both the northern and southern polar regions, the role of protected areas in monitoring change in a warming world, polar resource management and development, impacts on northern indigenous peoples, case studies of the biodiversity of selected polar organisms, impacts of sea ice loss on terrestrial and marine organisms and ecosystems, interconnections with lower latitudes, and the influence of historical processes that have impacted polar diversity.

M.","Species conservation often faces many challenges, such as addressing threats from multiple stressor sources, representing under-studied taxa, and understanding implications of spatial extent. To overcome these challenges, we assessed contemporary anthropogenic threats from stream fragmentation and landscape disturbance as well as future habitat suitability under climate change for traditionally well-studied (fishes) and under-studied (mussels) imperiled fluvial taxa in Michigan, USA. To understand how threats to species vary spatially, predicted habitat suitability was analyzed for three hierarchically nested spatial extents: statewide, within species' biogeographic ranges, and within river patches fragmented by barriers. Comparison of current and future habitat suitability for 27 fish and 23 mussel species indicates large potential statewide gains for many warmwater and/or large river fishes and several mussel species, however these gains are greatly diminished by biogeographic range limitations and habitat fragmentation among current and future habitats. One mussel species and several cold- and coolwater fishes are projected to have significant habitat losses under climate change irrespective of spatial extent. On average, 79% of habitats for mussels and 58% for fishes were considered moderately to severely disturbed from current human landscape activities. Habitat fragmentation was greater for fishes than mussels, with large dams playing a primary role in fragmenting habitats relative to small dams and waterfalls. Results indicate that threat assessments can vary substantially according to spatial extent and taxa, and consideration of both contemporary and future threats to habitats is needed to inform conservation of imperiled fluvial organisms.",2022,"","Water","14","21","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14213464","","#17481","Cooper 2022","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This study synthesizes existing research associated with the potential effects of a changing climate on the quality and quantity of groundwater in the Great Lakes Basin. It includes analyses of impacts on (1) recharge, (2) groundwater storage, (3) discharge and groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions, (4) exacerbating future urban development impacts on groundwater, (5) groundwater quality, and (6) ecohydrology. Large spatial and temporal (i.e., seasonal) variability in groundwater response to climate change between regions is anticipated.

At these small scales, groundwater systems are generally projected to be fairly resilient to climate change impacts. However, modelling studies of larger basins (e.g., Grand River, Saginaw Bay, Maumee River) predict an increase in groundwater storage. Uncertainty in model simulations, particularly from climate models that are used to force hydrological models, is a major challenge.

M.","The effects of water level fluctuations on fish and other aquatic biota, with an emphasis on winter water withdrawal in northern regions is reviewed. Water demands for population growth and development are adding pressure on water reserves, particularly when coupled with changing climatic conditions. Water level fluctuations can have adverse effects on the environment, most notably to hydrologic and biotic processes ranging in magnitude from the micro-scale to landscape level. Water level management of lakes and reservoirs can affect all forms of aquatic biota. The severity of effect is dependant on the magnitude, duration and timing of the fluctuation, and the species exposed. In northwestern Canada and northern Alaska, water is withdrawn from water bodies to construct ice-roads and other winter based developments. Biota in small, isolated water bodies are particularly sensitive to reductions in winter water levels. Water withdrawals can reduce the oxygen available to overwintering fish, while reduced water levels can reduce habitat for fish and furbearers, and freeze littoral areas killing plants, invertebrates, and fish eggs. Regulatory winter water withdrawal thresholds have been developed in the Northwest Territories and Alaska and continue to be refined as new data becomes available. The use of thresholds can help minimize or avoid negative impacts to the environment, particularly fish, from winter water withdrawal activities. Many different factors may influence the effect that winter water withdrawal has on a water body, such as basin shape, substrate and location. More research is warranted to better understand the linkages between anthropogenic and natural water level fluctuations and their combined effect on aquatic ecosystems.

The limited data currently available suggest that the effect of increased atmospheric CO2 on herbivory will be not only highly species-specific but also specific to each insect-plant system. Several scenarios can be predicted, however: local extinctions will occur; the endangered species status as well as the pest status of some insect species will change; geographic distributions for some insect species will shift with host-plant ranges; and changes in the population dynamics of affected insect species will influence their interactions with other insects and plants. An analysis of the available literature indicates that many orders containing insect species important for ecosystem conservation, and even those important as agricultural or medical pests, have not been examined in terms of the effect of enhanced CO2 levels on populations.

There are limited studies that have established how the climate-induced disasters have impacted the ICH elements of food. As such, there is need to first establish the ICH elements or components of food and then how these ICH elements of food are being affected by climate change-induced disasters. This review was therefore aimed at identifying based on the literature the different ICH elements of food and how these can be affected by climate-induced disasters such as floods, cyclones, and droughts. This review paper shows that food is not only considered an ICH because of it being specific to a territory or ethnic group, but there are several dimensions or elements of food that makes it qualify as an ICH, which we grouped into six categories or domains. These domains of food as ICH are (i) food traditions and customs, (ii) food production, processing, and storage, (iii) dietary culture, (iv) eating and social practices, (v) culinary, and (vi) geographical indications. These ICH domains of food as ICH we created them based on the similarity of the different characteristics of the ICH elements are identified in the literature. This new insight is useful in assessing the impact of climate-induced natural disasters on intangible cultural heritage in food systems. More so, the identified categories of ICH elements of food can be viewed as constructs in a framework that can be used to assess the impact of climate-induced disasters on intangible cultural heritage in food systems and the ultimate impact on nutrition outcomes.

"392","A summary of the effects of climate change on Ontario's aquatic ecosystems","Dove-Thompson, D.; Lewis, C.; Gray, P. A.; Chu, C.; Dunlop, W. I.","Climate change will alter Ontario's aquatic ecosystems as a result of increases in air and water temperature, decreases in ice and snow cover, and changes in the timing and amount of precipitation. These changes will affect the hydrological cycle by altering the flow of water and water chemistry. Threats to freshwater fauna include nutrient enrichment, hydrological modifications, habitat degradation and loss, pollution, and the spread of invasive species. A changing climate and increasing levels of ultraviolet light pose additional risks that add to existing threats. The combination of changes in land use, habitat, and climate present a serious challenge to the long-term integrity and health of aquatic ecosystems. Since fish are cold-blooded, increases in water temperature will affect their distribution, growth, reproduction, and survival. The habitat and productivity for coldwater species, such as lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), may decline substantially with increased air and water temperatures. Coolwater fishes likely will respond to climate change in a variety of ways. For example, in the case of walleye (Sander vitreus) in central and northern Ontario, warming may increase available habitat. Overall, model projections suggest a northward shift in the location of the walleye fishery. Many warmwater fishes are projected to benefit from warmer water temperatures. For example, smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), which reach the northern extent of their range in Ontario, may expand northward as warmer water temperatures facilitate increased growth and recruitment. A northward expansion of warmwater fish species will disrupt the life history strategies of cool- and coldwater fish species. Commercial and recreational harvest opportunities for lake trout, brook trout, and perhaps walleye will decline, particularly in southern Ontario. Although these losses may be offset somewhat by increased opportunities to harvest warmwater species, the expected changes in fish communities will bring a variety of social and economic challenges. To meet these challenges, an adaptive approach to fisheries and aquatic ecosystem management in Ontario is needed. Known and potential climate change effects must be incorporated into existing fisheries management plans and strategic plans will need to be revisited to ensure that they reflect anticipated changes. Given the importance of understanding the range of potential climate change effects on aquatic assets, it is essential that management agencies and organizations identify and apply appropriate effective mitigation and adaptive management strategies.

S.; Ryan, J.","More than 120 native bee species have been documented in Maine since 1930 in association with the native plant Vaccinium angustifolium (Lowbush Blueberry). We report 3 studies in commercial Lowbush Blueberry fields: (1) a survey of diversity in Osmia (mason bees) and closely related Megachile (leaf-cutter bees) using trap nests in 93 fields from 1990 to 2012, (2) a 29-year study of a native bee community, and (3) an examination of climate-change effects on bee-foraging periods during blueberry bloom. Osmia appeared to be more stable over a 22-year period in their species richness and relative abundances in Lowbush Blueberry fields when compared to Megachile over a similar 17-year period. The native bee community in a single location in Winterport was observed to fluctuate in abundance 2 to 3 times annually. Modeling of the total bee community and taxa-specific group abundances (Bombus, Megachilids, Andrenids, and Halictids and other bees) suggest that while stochastic density-independent processes such as weather can play a role in determining their annual oscillations, density-dependent lags of 1 and 2 years appear to be the main driving forces. Estimation of fruit set over the same 29-year period, based upon native bee abundance, suggests that pollination is more buffered than community bee abundance, resulting in a lesser degree of fluctuation over time. We speculate that this finding is due to redundancy in floral preferences, multiple floral visitations, and differing pollination efficiencies by the highly diverse native bee community associated with Lowbush Blueberry. Effects of climate change in Maine Lowbush Blueberry fields during May bloom was investigated using a historic weather database. Since the early 1990s, precipitation has, to a large degree, reduced the number of optimal bee foraging days during bloom, with implications for pollination and bee species abundances.

Methods: A meta-analysis was carried out to compare local growth rates for a lichen epiphyte, Lobaria pulmonaria, to coarse-grained interpolated climate surfaces. Growth rates were sampled from small-scale experiments conducted within different forest settings and for different regions of the world. Generalised linear mixed models were used to compare thallus growth (response) to a suite of climatic variables derived from the WorldClim dataset. Results: A significant relationship between thallus growth measured for experimental forest microhabitats and macroclimatic variables (total precipitation and annual mean temperature) was found. This relationship was validated through a comparison with L. pulmonaria's North American range for which projected growth rates were higher and lower where the species tended to be present and absent, respectively.

J.; Eisen, L.","Ixodes scapularis (the blacklegged tick) is widely distributed in forested areas across the eastern United States. The public health impact of I. scapularis is greatest in the north, where nymphal stage ticks commonly bite humans and serve as primary vectors for multiple human pathogens. There were dramatic increases in the tick's distribution and abundance over the last half-century in the northern part of the eastern US, and climate warming is commonly mentioned as a primary driver for these changes. In this review, we summarize the evidence for the observed spread and proliferation of I. scapularis being driven by climate warming. Although laboratory and small-scale field studies have provided insights into how temperature and humidity impact survival and reproduction of I. scapularis, using these associations to predict broad-scale distribution and abundance patterns is more challenging. Numerous efforts have been undertaken to model the distribution and abundance of I. scapularis at state, regional, and global scales based on climate and landscape variables, but outcomes have been ambiguous. Across the models, the functional relationships between seasonal or annual measures of heat, cold, precipitation, or humidity and tick presence or abundance were inconsistent. The contribution of climate relative to landscape variables was poorly defined. Over the last half-century, climate warming occurred in parallel with spread and population increase of the white-tailed deer, the most important reproductive host for I. scapularis adults, in the northern part of the eastern US. There is strong evidence for white-tailed deer playing a key role to facilitate spread and proliferation of I. scapularis in the US over the last century. However, due to a lack of spatially and temporally congruent data, climate, landscape, and host variables are rarely included in the same models, thus limiting the ability to evaluate their relative contributions or interactions in defining the geographic range and abundance patterns of ticks. We conclude that the role of climate change as a key driver for geographic expansion and population increase of I. scapularis in the northern part of the eastern US over the last half-century remains uncertain.",2024,"","Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases","15","1","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2023.102286","","#18015","Eisen 2024","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

M.; Meiswinkel, R.","Vector-borne animal diseases pose a continuous and substantial threat to livestock economies around the globe. Increasing international travel, the globalisation of trade, and climate change are likely to play a progressively more important role in the introduction, establishment and spread of arthropod-borne pathogens worldwide. A review of the literature reveals that many climatic variables, functioning singly or in combination, exert varying effects on the distribution and range of Culicoides vector midges and mosquitoes. For example, higher temperatures may be associated with increased insect abundance - thereby amplifying the risk of disease transmission - but there are no indications yet of dramatic shifts occurring in the geographic range of Culicoides midges. However, the same cannot be said for mosquitoes: over the last few decades, multiple Asian species have established themselves in Europe, spread and are unlikely to ever be eradicated. Research on how insects respond to changes in climate is still in its infancy. The authors argue that we need to grasp how other annectant changes, such as extremes in precipitation (drought and flooding), may affect the dispersal capability of mosquitoes. Models are useful for assessing the interplay between mosquito vectors expanding their range and the native flora and fauna; however, ecological studies employing classical mark-release-recapture techniques remain essential for addressing fundamental questions about the survival and dispersal of mosquito species, with the resulting parameters fed directly into new-generation disease transmission models. Studies on the eventual impact of mosquitoes on animal and human health should be tackled through large-scale integrated research programmes.

G.","This paper identifies and characterizes current knowledge on climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability for Canada's northern coastline, outlining key research gaps. Warming temperatures and increased precipitation have been documented across the northern coast, with the rate of sea ice decline ranging from 2.9% to 10.4% per decade. Storm intensity and frequency is increasing, and permafrost is warming across the region. Many of these changes are projected to accelerate in the future, with in excess of 8 degrees C warming in winter possible under a high-emission scenario by 2081-2100. Vulnerability to these changes differs by region and community, a function of geographic location, nature of climate change impacts, and human factors. Capacity to manage climate change is high in some sectors, such as subsistence harvesting, but is being undermined by long-term societal changes. In other sectors, such as infrastructure and transportation, limitations in climate risk management capacity result in continuing high vulnerabilities. There is evidence that adaptation is taking place in response to experienced and projected impacts, although readiness for adaptation is challenged by limited resources, institutional capacity, and a need for support for adaptation across levels of government. Priority areas for future research include (i) expanding the sectoral and geographic focus of understanding on climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability; (ii) integrating climatic and socio-economic projections into vulnerability and adaptation assessments; (iii) developing an evidence base on adaptation options; and (iv) monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of adaptation support.

Science-management collaboration was initiated on national forests in eastern Washington where resource managers showed a keen interest in science-based options for adapting to climate change at a 2-day workshop. Scientists and managers reviewed current climate change science and identified resources vulnerable to expected climate change. Vulnerabilities related to vegetation and habitat management included potential reductions in forest biodiversity and low forest resilience to changing disturbance regimes. The vulnerabilities related to aquatic and infrastructure resources included changing water quality and quantity, the risk to roads and other facilities from changes to hydrologic regimes, and the potential loss of at-risk aquatic species and habitats. Managers then worked in facilitated groups to identify adaptations that could be implemented through management and planning to reduce the vulnerability of key resources to climate change. The identified adaptations were grouped under two major headings: Increasing Ecological Resiliency to Climate Change, and Increasing Social and Economic Resiliency to Climate Change.

Data on fish tissue mercury concentrations collected by state, tribal, and provincial governments via contaminant monitoring programs have been compiled into large data bases by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Great Lakes National Monitoring Program Office (GLNPO), the Ontario Ministry of the Environment's Fish Contaminants Monitoring and Surveillance Program (FMSP), and many others. These data have been used by a wide range of governmental and academic investigators worldwide to examine long-term and recent trends in fish tissue mercury concentrations. The largest component of the trend literature is for North American freshwater species important in recreational fisheries. This review of temporal trends in fish tissue mercury concentrations focused on published results from freshwater fisheries of North America as well as marine fisheries worldwide. Trends in fish tissue mercury concentrations in North American lakes with marked overall decreases were reported over the period 1972-2016. These trends are consistent with reported mercury emission declines as well as trends in wet deposition across the U.S. and Canada. More recently, a leveling-off in the rate of decreases or increases in fish tissue mercury concentrations has been reported. Increased emissions of mercury from global sources beginning between 1990 and 1995, despite a decrease in North American emissions, have been advanced as an explanation for the observed changes in fish tissue trends. In addition to increased atmospheric deposition, the other factors identified to explain the observed mercury increases in the affected fish species include a systematic shift in the food-web structure with the introduction of non-native species, creating a new or expanding role for sediments as a net source for mercury. The influences of climate change have also been identified as contributing factors, including considerations such as increases in temperature (resulting in metabolic changes and higher uptake rates of methylmercury), increased rainfall intensity and runoff (hydrologic export of organic matter carrying HgII from watersheds to surface water), and water level fluctuations that alter either the methylation of mercury or the mobilization of monomethylmercury. The primary source of mercury exposure in the human diet in North America is from the commercial fish and seafood market which is dominated (>90%) by marine species. However, very little information is available on mercury trends in marine fisheries. Most of the data used in the published marine trend studies are assembled from earlier reports. The data collection efforts are generally intermittent, and the spatial and fish-size distribution of the target species vary widely. As a result, convincing evidence for the existence of fish tissue mercury trends in marine fish is generally lacking. However, there is some evidence from sampling of large, long-lived commercially-important fish showing both lower mercury concentrations in the North Atlantic in response to reduced anthropogenic mercury emission rates in North America and increases in fish tissue mercury concentrations over time in the North Pacific in response to increased mercury loading.",2019,"","Special Issue: Mercury in the environment of New York State.","29","10","1739-1749","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-019-02112-3","","#18773","Grieb 2019","Colleen Miller (2024-09-04 04:22:32)(Select): """"The potential effect of climate change on the changing trends in fish tissue concentrations was noted by almost all the authors.

Many of these diseases are no longer present, mainly because of changes in land use, agricultural methods, residential patterns, human behaviour, and vector control. However, diseases that may be transmitted to humans from wild birds or mammals (zoonoses; e.g. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and leptospirosis) continue to circulate in nature in many parts of the country. Most vector-borne diseases exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, which clearly suggests that they are weather sensitive. Rainfall, temperature, and other weather variables affect in many ways both the vectors and the pathogens they transmit. For example, high temperatures can increase or reduce survival rate, depending on the vector, its behaviour, ecology, and many other factors. Thus, the probability of transmission may or may not be increased by higher temperatures. The tremendous growth in international travel increases the risk of importation of vector-borne diseases, some of which can be transmitted locally under suitable circumstances at the right time of the year.

The focus of the assessment was established during a multi-agency/organization workshop that established the goal to conduct a rigorous evaluation of a limited range of topics rather than produce a broad overview. The report explores the potential consequences of climate change for: (a) snowpack, glaciers, and winter recreation; (b) coastal landscapes and associated environments, (c) vegetation, (d) salmon, and (e) a select set of wildlife species.

W.; Dunham, A.; Dibacco, C.","1. Establishment of protected areas to maintain biodiversity requires identification, prioritization and management of stressors that may undermine conservation goals. Nonindigenous species and climate change are critical ecosystem stressors that need greater attention in the context of spatial planning and management of protected areas. Risk of invasion into protected areas needs to be quantified under current and projected climate conditions in conjunction with prioritization of key vectors and vulnerable areas to enable development of effective management strategies. 2. We assessed the likelihood of invasion across networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) to determine how invaded MPAs may compromise MPA networks by sharing nonindigenous species. We evaluated invasion risk in 83 MPAs along Canada's Pacific coast for eight nonindigenous species based on environmental suitability under current and future (average conditions from 2041 to 2070) climate conditions and association with shipping and boating pathways. We applied species distribution models and network analysis of vessel tracking data for 805 vessels in 2016 that connected MPAs. 3. The probability of occurrence within MPAs and the proportion of MPA area that is suitable to the modelled species significantly increased under future climate conditions, with six species reaching over 90% predicted occurrence across MPAs and over 70% of suitable area within MPAs. Vessel traffic created four network clusters of 61 highly connected MPAs that spanned the coastline. Occupancy of over 90% of the MPAs within the clusters was predicted for most species. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate a high likelihood of marine protected area (MPA) network invasion based on current and future environmental conditions and vectors of spread, and the potential for extensive nonindigenous species distributions within MPAs. Our approach highlights how interacting stressors can exacerbate MPA susceptibility to nonindigenous species, adding further challenges for protected area management. Management planning that invests in understanding connectivity and vector processes (human behaviours) is more likely to derive effective policies to stem the flow of nonindigenous species under both current and future conditions. In particular, biosecurity measures including vessel biofouling regulations and MPA- and MPA network-specific plans for prevention, monitoring and mitigation of nonindigenous species are needed.",2020,"","Special Feature: Informing decision-making with indigenous and local knowledge and science.","57","9","1793-1805","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13652","","#19401","Iacarella 2020","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Ongoing demand for critical ecosystem services requires an understanding of the populations and communities in these ecosystems in the future. This paper represents a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation-funded Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network addressing the core research area of """"populations and communities."""" The objective of this effort was to show the importance of long-term data collection and experiments for addressing the hardest questions in scientific ecology that have significant implications for environmental policy and management. Each LTER site developed at least one compelling case study about what their site could look like in 50-100 yr as human and environmental drivers influencing specific ecosystems change. As the case studies were prepared, five themes emerged, and the studies were grouped into papers in this LTER Futures Special Feature addressing state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects. This paper addresses the """"connectivity"""" theme and has examples from the Phoenix (urban), Niwot Ridge (alpine tundra), McMurdo Dry Valleys (polar desert), Plum Island (coastal), Santa Barbara Coastal (coastal), and Jornada (arid grassland and shrubland) sites. Connectivity has multiple dimensions, ranging from multi-scalar interactions in space to complex interactions over time that govern the transport of materials and the distribution and movement of organisms. The case studies presented here range widely, showing how land-use legacies interact with climate to alter the structure and function of arid ecosystems and flows of resources and organisms in Antarctic polar desert, alpine, urban, and coastal marine ecosystems. Long-term ecological research demonstrates that connectivity can, in some circumstances, sustain valuable ecosystem functions, such as the persistence of foundation species and their associated biodiversity or, it can be an agent of state change, as when it increases wind and water erosion.

Consequently the planet's geological, biological and ecological systems, including human biology and health are expected to be altered. These effects are set to include an increase in adverse climate and weather events. The developing world carries a disproportionate burden of health implications that result from extreme climate and weather events, largely because they have limited capacity to respond to the cumulative impacts resulting from climate change. The developed world, however, is not immune to the impacts of climate change despite being highly industrialised and well serviced. In addition, there are a range of documented health impacts associated with climatic factors and a growing number of papers theorising how long-term climate change could impact on health. This article examines literature on the impact of climate change, specifically ultraviolet and water changes on eye health. Geographic and environmental factors that influence eye health, such as location and the spread of blindness causing diseases such as trachoma (bacterial infection of the eye) and onchocerciasis (parasitic disease in the eye) are also examined.

N.; Peterson, D. L.; Swetnam, T. W.","This synthesis provides an ecological foundation for management of the diverse ecosystems and fire regimes of North America, based on scientific principles of fire interactions with vegetation, fuels, and biophysical processes. Although a large amount of scientific data on fire exists, most of those data have been collected at small spatial and temporal scales. Thus, it is challenging to develop consistent science-based plans for large spatial and temporal scales where most fire management and planning occur. Understanding the regional geographic context of fire regimes is critical for developing appropriate and sustainable management strategies and policy. The degree to which human intervention has modified fire frequency, intensity, and severity varies greatly among different ecosystems, and must be considered when planning to alter fuel loads or implement restorative treatments. Detailed discussion of six ecosystems - ponderosa pine forest (western North America), chaparral (California), boreal forest (Alaska and Canada), Great Basin sagebrush (intermountain West), pine and pine-hardwood forests (Southern Appalachian Mountains), and longleaf pine (Southeastern United States) - illustrates the complexity of fire regimes and that fire management requires a clear regional focus that recognizes where conflicts might exist between fire hazard reduction and resource needs. In some systems, such as ponderosa pine, treatments are usually compatible with both fuel reduction and resource needs, whereas in others, such as chaparral, the potential exists for conflicts that need to be closely evaluated.

"413","The great lapse: climate change, water resources and economic risks in the Great Lakes","Kehl, J.","The striking vastness of the world's largest surface freshwater resource, the Laurentian Great Lakes, has generated the fallacy that they are not highly vulnerable to climate change. This fallacy has created a great lapse in our research and understanding of the effects of climate change on the Great Lakes, which are approaching critical environmental thresholds and jeopardizing ecosystem services. This article takes the novel approach of correcting the disconnect between the perception of vastness and the reality of vulnerability to climate change in the Great Lakes, and takes an additional novel step to link the water risks with the economic risks. The primary purpose is to demonstrate the interdependence of the freshwater ecosystem services affected by climate change with the economies that are highly dependent on those freshwater services in the Great Lakes region. Although many believe that environmental science or ethical arguments should be sufficient to warrant action on climate change, evidence shows that policy-makers are not compelled to generate advances unless there are strong economic components. This article highlights the leading edge of climate science for the Great Lakes, having conducted 32 in depth interviews with experts in microbiology, ecology, and limnology, among others, but it also adds substantively to previous work by providing economic evidence of water risks in the agricultural sector and energy sector, which constitute over $6 trillion in value and jobs that are specifically dependent on lakes waters. The article concludes by articulating three specific conclusions: the economic viability of the agricultural sector and the energy sector are jeopardized by loss of federal funding for climate change adaptation in the water sector; the existing policies such as between sectors such as the Farm Bill and Energy Future Bill are mal-aligned and should be aligned with the water sector; and negative environmental externalities including factors that exacerbate climate change should be incorporated into the true cost of water so we can more accurately conduct ecosystem valuation and, thus, address the true economic and environmental cost of climate change on the Great Lakes and our greatest water resources.

J.","Climate change can have a complex impact that also influences human and animal health. For example, climate change alters the conditions for pathogens and vectors of zoonotic diseases. Signs of this are the increasing spread of the West Nile and Usutu viruses and the establishment of new vector species, such as specific mosquito and tick species, in Europe and other parts of the world. With these changes come new challenges for maintaining human and animal health. This paper reports on an analysis of the literature focused on a bibliometric analysis of the Scopus database and VOSviewer software for creating visualization maps which identifies the zoonotic health risks for humans and animals caused by climate change. The sources retained for the analysis totaled 428 and different thresholds (N) were established for each item varying from N 5 to 10. The main findings are as follows: First, published documents increased in 2009-2015 peaking in 2020. Second, the primary sources have changed since 2018, partly attributable to the increase in human health concerns due to human-to-human transmission. Third, the USA, the UK, Canada, Australia, Italy, and Germany perform most zoonosis research.

A.","Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) cause many diseases worldwide and their transmission is likely to change with land use and climate changes. La Crosse virus (LACV) is historically transmitted by the native mosquito Aedes triseriatus (Say) in the upper Midwestern US, but the invasive congeners Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and A. japonicus (Theobald), which co-occur with A. triseriatus in water-holding containers, may be important accessory vectors in the Appalachian region where La Crosse encephalitis is an emerging disease. This review focuses on evidence for how climate, land use, and biological invasions may have direct abiotic and indirect community-level impacts on immature developmental stages (eggs and larvae) of Aedes mosquitoes. Because vector-borne diseases usually vary in space and time and are related to the ecology of the vector species, we propose that the ecology of its mosquito vectors, particularly at their immature stages, has played an important role in the emergence of La Crosse encephalitis in the Appalachian region and represents a model for investigating the effects of environmental changes on other vector-borne diseases. We summarize the health effects of LACV and associated socioeconomic costs that make it the most important native mosquito-borne disease in the US. We review of the transmission of LACV, and present evidence for the impacts of climate, land use, and biological invasions on Aedes mosquito communities. Finally, we discuss important questions about the ecology of LACV mosquito vectors that may improve our understanding of the impacts of environmental changes on LACV and other arboviruses.",2012,"","EcoHealth","9","2","217-228","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-012-0773-7","","#20312","Leisnham 2012","Colleen Miller (2024-08-22 02:35:09)(Select): Implicit transboundary ;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

J.","Control programs are implemented to mitigate the damage caused by invasive species worldwide. In the highly invaded Great Lakes, the climate is expected to become warmer with more extreme weather and variable precipitation, resulting in shorter iced-over periods and variable tributary flows as well as changes to pH and river hydrology and hydrogeomorphology. We review how climate change influences physiology, behavior, and demography of a damaging invasive species, sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), in the Great Lakes, and the consequences for sea lamprey control efforts. Sea lamprey control relies on surveys to monitor abundance of larval sea lamprey in Great Lakes tributaries. The abundance of parasitic, juvenile sea lampreys in the lakes is calculated by surveying wounding rates on lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and trap surveys are used to enumerate adult spawning runs. Chemical control using lampricides (i.e., lamprey pesticides) to target larval sea lamprey and barriers to prevent adult lamprey from reaching spawning grounds are the most important tools used for sea lamprey population control. We describe how climate change could affect larval survival in rivers, growth and maturation in lakes, phenology and the spawning migration as adults return to rivers, and the overall abundance and distribution of sea lamprey in the Great Lakes. Our review suggests that Great Lakes sea lamprey may benefit from climate change with longer growing seasons, more rapid growth, and greater access to spawning habitat, but uncertainties remain about the future availability and suitability of larval habitats. Consideration of the biology of invasive species and adaptation of the timing, intensity, and frequency of control efforts is critical to the management of biological invasions in a changing world, such as sea lamprey in the Great Lakes.",2020,"","Global Change Biology","26","3","1118-1137","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14957","","#20320","Lennox 2020","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

However, we know little of its ecology in the Arctic, which is unfortunate, because it possesses many traits that make it an excellent biomonitor of the condition of Arctic marine environments. Presently, Arctic fulmars face threats from harvest, bycatch in fisheries, and fouling in oil spills while the birds are in their winter range (the North Atlantic). However, during breeding, migration, and overwintering, they may also experience stress from ecotourism, contaminants, particulate garbage, and climate change.

The agricultural sector employed about 1.4 billion of the world's 3.4 billion workers in 2008. Even without climate change, coming years are likely to witness continuing large-scale migration out of the agricultural sector, particularly in developing countries where farm incomes are significantly lower than non-farm incomes. Climate change, specifically global warming, is likely to accelerate this pace of migration. Several economic models project that global warming will have more effects on the distribution of farm production than global farm output, with new areas becoming viable for farming as a result of higher temperatures. However, far more people are likely to be displaced by global warming than those likely to find jobs in these new farming areas. Existing policy addressing the challenges already faced by agricultural workers as they seek alternative economic opportunities is limited. The likely impact of climate change on the agricultural sector, more displacement, underscores the urgent need for policymakers and the international community to commit greater attention and resources towards developing a package of innovative policies to provide workers with alternative opportunities within the agricultural sector or to ease their out-migration from the sector.",2010,"","Climate Change and Migration Series","","","7-pp","","","","#20850","Martin 2010","Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-22 03:46:01)(Select): Focused on international agricultural migration patterns, including mentions of migrants as essential to agricultural production in destination countries.

The Arctic and Antarctic regions are extremely sensitive to climate change and have displayed profound and variable changes over recent decades, including decreases in sea ice extent, greening of tundra, and changes to hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. It is unclear how polar-adapted arthropods will respond to such changes, though many are expected to be at great risk of extinction. Here, we review the adaptive mechanisms that allow polar arthropods to persist in extreme environments and discuss how the effects of climate change at the poles will likely favour non-native species or those with the ability to rapidly evolve and/or acclimate. We find that physiological, behavioural, plastic, and genetic data are limited in scope for polar arthropods and research on adaptive responses to change is scarce. This restricts our ability to predict how they may respond to a warming climate.

While changes in fish populations and community structure threaten the sustainability of fisheries, our capacity to adapt by tracking and projecting marine species remains a challenge due to data discontinuities in biological observations, lack of data availability, and mismatch between data and real species distributions. To assess the extent of this challenge, we review the global status and accessibility of ongoing scientific bottom trawl surveys. In total, we gathered metadata for 283,925 samples from 95 surveys conducted regularly from 2001 to 2019. We identified that 59% of the metadata collected are not publicly available, highlighting that the availability of data is the most important challenge to assess species redistributions under global climate change. Given that the primary purpose of surveys is to provide independent data to inform stock assessment of commercially important populations, we further highlight that single surveys do not cover the full range of the main commercial demersal fish species. An average of 18 surveys is needed to cover at least 50% of species ranges, demonstrating the importance of combining multiple surveys to evaluate species range shifts. We assess the potential for combining surveys to track transboundary species redistributions and show that differences in sampling schemes and inconsistency in sampling can be overcome with spatio-temporal modeling to follow species density redistributions. In light of our global assessment, we establish a framework for improving the management and conservation of transboundary and migrating marine demersal species.

S.","Mercury cycles at levels three- to five-fold higher today than the pre-Industrial era, resulting in global contamination of ecosystems. In the western United States (U.S.), mercury mobilization has led to widespread production of methylmercury (MeHg), a potent, bioaccumulating neurotoxin, which has resulted in fish consumption advisories across all states. Mountain regions are particularly sensitive to continued mercury contamination as they receive higher rates of atmospheric deposition, compared to lower elevations, and have aquatic ecosystems on the landscape conducive to MeHg production. In this paper, we focus on the U.S. Rocky Mountain region and synthesize: (1) current knowledge regarding the mercury cycle; (2) impacts of climate change on the mercury cycle connected to hydrology and wildfire; and (3) future research priorities for informing mercury research and regulation. Studies on the interactions between mercury contamination and climate change in mountain ecosystems is still nascent. We use the findings from this synthesis to summarize the following research needs: (1) quantify sources of mercury in wet and dry deposition, as these pathways dictate mercury exposure and toxicity, and are shifting with climate change; (2) investigate MeHg in mountain aquatic ecosystems, which are important pathways of human mercury exposure and provide food resources and habitat to local wildlife; and (3) examine the disproportionate impact of mercury contamination on indigenous communities through community-led research.

D.","The glaciers of western Canada and the conterminous United States have dominantly retreated since the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) in the nineteenth century, although average rates of retreat varied from strong in the first-half of the twentieth century, with glaciers stabilizing or even advancing until 1980, and then resuming consistent recession. This retreat has been accompanied by statistically detectable declines in late-summer streamflow from glacier-fed catchments over much of the study area, although there is some geographical variation: over recent decades, glaciers in northwest BC and southwest Yukon have lost mass dominantly by thinning with relatively low rates of terminal retreat, and glacier-fed streams in that region have experienced increasing flows. In many valleys, glacier retreat has produced geomorphic hazards, including outburst floods from moraine-dammed lakes, mass failures from oversteepened valley walls and debris flows generated on moraines. In addition to these hydrologic and geomorphic changes, evidence is presented that glacier retreat will result in higher stream temperatures, possibly transient increases in suspended sediment fluxes and concentrations, and changes in water chemistry.

W.","The spread of medusahead across the western United States has severe implications for a wide range of ecosystem services. Medusahead invasion reduces biodiversity, wildlife habitat and forage production, and often leads to increased fire frequency and restoration costs. Medusahead is problematic in the Intermountain West and California Annual Grasslands. The last review of medusahead ecology and management was completed 20 years ago. Since the last review, there have been scientific advances in medusahead management suggesting a significant need to develop an up-to-date synthesis. Medusahead continues to pose a serious threat to rangeland ecosystems. In this synthesis, we present new information regarding the ecology of medusahead, suggest a framework for managing medusahead based on invasion level, and identify research needs to further improve management of this invasive annual grass. Success of different management practices varies between the Intermountain West and California Annual Grasslands, signifying that the best management practices are those specifically tailored with consideration of climate, soil, plant community characteristics, and management objectives.

C.","Introduction: Inuit from communities across the Arctic are still existing in subsistence living. Hunting, fishing and gathering is an important part of the culture and the harvested 'country food' provides sources of nutrients invaluable to maintaining the health of the populations. However, Inuit are voicing their concerns on how observed climate change is impacting on their traditional life. The objective of this study was to report on observed climate changes and how they affect the country food harvest in two communities in the Canadian Arctic. The nutritional implications of these changes are discussed and also how the communities need to plan for adaptations. Methods: A total of 17 adult participants from Repulse Bay and Kugaaruk, Nunavut were invited to participate. Participants were selected using purposeful sampling methods selecting the most knowledgeable community members for the study. Inuit Elders, hunters, processors of the animals, and other community members above the age of 18 years were selected for their knowledge of harvesting and the environment. Two-day bilingual focus groups using semi-directed, unstructured questions were held in each community to discuss perceived climate changes related to the access and availability of key species. Key topics of focus included ice, snow, weather, marine mammals, land mammals, fish, species ranges, migration patterns, and quality and quantity of animal populations. Maps were used to pinpoint harvesting locations. A qualitative analysis categorizing strategy was used for analysis of data. This strategy involves coding data in order to form themes and to allow for cross-comparison analysis between communities. Each major animal represented a category; other categories included land, sea, and weather. Results were verified by the participants and community leaders. Results: Three themes emerged from the observations: (1) ice/snow/water; (2) weather; and (3) changes in species. Climate change can affect the accessibility and availability of the key species of country foods including caribou, marine mammals, fish, birds and plants. Various observations on relationship between weather and population health and distributions of the animal/plant species were reported. While many of the observations were common between the two communities, many were community specific and inconsistent. Participants from both communities found that climate change was affecting the country food harvest in both positive and negative ways. Key nutrients that could be affected are protein, iron, zinc, n-3 fatty acids, selenium and vitamins D and A. Conclusion: Community members from Repulse Bay and Kugaaruk have confirmed that climate change is affecting their traditional food system. Local and regional efforts are needed to plan for food security and health promotion in the region, and global actions are needed to slow down the process of climate change.",2010,"","Circumpolar Special Issue: Human health at the ends of the earth.","10","2","Article-1370","","","","#21466","Nancarrow 2010","Tyler McIntosh (2024-09-11 06:01:05)(Select): not a review - surveys of community members;","Biotic; IK; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

U.","Of the 3,500 species of mosquitoes worldwide, only a small portion carry and transmit the mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) that cause approximately half a million deaths annually worldwide. The most common exotic MBDs, such as malaria and dengue, are not currently established in Canada, in part because of our relatively harsh climate; however, this situation could evolve with climate change. Mosquitoes native to Canada may become infected with new pathogens and move into new regions within Canada. In addition, new mosquito species may move into Canada from other countries, and these exotic species may bring exotic MBDs as well. With high levels of international travel, including to locations with exotic MBDs, there will be more travel-acquired cases of MBDs. With climate change, there is the potential for exotic mosquito populations to become established in Canada. There is already a small area of Canada where exotic Aedes mosquitoes have become established although, to date, there is no evidence that these carry any exotic (or already endemic) MBDs. The increased risks of spreading MBDs, or introducing exotic MBDs, will need a careful clinical and public health response. Clinicians will need to maintain a high level of awareness of current trends, to promote mosquito bite prevention strategies, and to know the laboratory tests needed for early detection and when to report laboratory results to public health. Public health efforts will need to focus on ongoing active surveillance, public and professional awareness and mosquito control.

M.; Lal, R.; Wohl, E.; Fairfax, E.; Gellis, A. C.; Pollock, M. M.","In this article we describe the natural hydrogeomorphological and biogeochemical cycles of dryland fluvial ecosystems that make them unique, yet vulnerable to land use activities and climate change. We introduce Natural Infrastructure in Dryland Streams (NIDS), which are structures naturally or anthropogenically created from earth, wood, debris, or rock that can restore implicit function of these systems. This manuscript further discusses the capability of and functional similarities between beaver dams and anthropogenic NIDS, documented by decades of scientific study. In addition, we present the novel, evidence-based finding that NIDS can create wetlands in water-scarce riparian zones, with soil organic carbon stock as much as 200 to 1400 Mg C/ha in the top meter of soil. We identify the key restorative action of NIDS, which is to slow the drainage of water from the landscape such that more of it can infiltrate and be used to facilitate natural physical, chemical, and biological processes in fluvial environments. Specifically, we assert that the rapid drainage of water from such environments can be reversed through the restoration of natural infrastructure that once existed. We then explore how NIDS can be used to restore the natural biogeochemical feedback loops in these systems. We provide examples of how NIDS have been used to restore such feedback loops, the lessons learned from installation of NIDS in the dryland streams of the southwestern United States, how such efforts might be scaled up, and what the implications are for mitigating climate change effects.

Therefore, this review paper examined sustainable global water management by focussing on four sustainable development goal (SDG #6) indicators, including water use efficiency in agriculture, integrated water management, transboundary water cooperation, and water user participation. The review covered articles from 2016 to 2023, using Scopus and Web of Science databases with specific selection criteria. A total of 216 sources were downloaded, and after data screening, 72 articles were analysed along with additional supplementary materials such as books, conference papers, and United Nations documents. The finding indicates emerging trends in sustainable water management for agriculture, including water-efficient technologies like alternate wetting and drying, drip irrigation, mulching, etc. However, careful implementation is required to address environmental concerns, prevent water pollution, minimise yield reductions, and ensure long-term sustainability. Moreover, integrated water resource management has faced challenges in practical implementation due to governance structures, economic circumstances, cooperation, and collaboration among stakeholders. While over 600 treaties aim to promote international water cooperation, only a few have been effective. In addition, out of 500 transboundary groundwater sources shared by countries, only six have dedicated treaties to govern their use. Thus, clearly defined rights, responsibilities, and sustainable management practises for each shared aquifer would foster the sustainability of these resources.

A.","Clear Lake (Lake County, CA, USA) is hypereutrophic and used for drinking water, tribal use, and supports a significant fishing economy. The Mendocino Complex (2018), one of the largest wildfires in California's post-settlement history, burned 40% of the Clear Lake watershed, providing a timely opportunity to study the impacts of historical and current wildfires on this valuable aquatic resource. Using long-term monthly monitoring data from 1968 to 2019, paired with historical watershed fire data, we found that for the three largest fire years in the watershed's history, 3-year postfire median July-October epilimnetic total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were below or equal to 3-year prefire TP concentrations. However, both median TP epilimnetic concentrations and deepwater temperature across the lake have increased since the late 1960s. Long-term TP increases were more strongly correlated with monthly maximum air temperatures than precipitation, suggesting a potential role of warming-induced water column stratification, dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion, and high potential for internal phosphorus loading. Hypoxic occurrences were correlated with higher hypolimnetic soluble reactive phosphorus and TP concentrations, but additional high-frequency monitoring of DO will help determine the duration of anoxia and its contribution to internal phosphorus loading. These long-term data suggest that for this large, hypereutrophic lake, wildfires did not significantly alter in-lake TP concentrations based on long-term, monthly monitoring and that other internal or external sources of TP may mask any wildfire effects. Nonetheless, our study underscores the value of synthesizing decades of water quality, watershed wildfire, and climate data to build a more comprehensive, nuanced picture of multiple long-term threats to aquatic ecosystems under global change. Moreover, monitoring and studying fire effects across a wide range of lake types beyond this study will help promote more effective lake management during changing climates and increasingly frequent large wildfires.",2022,"","Ecosphere","13","12","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4271","","#21846","Palma-Dow 2022","Laura  Dee (2024-08-14 07:07:07)(Select): cross-boundary with tribe in Northern CA and discussions of human well being

The established natural reservoirs of human viruses are mainly farm animals, and, to a lesser extent, wild animals and arthropods. The intricate """"host-pathogen-environment"""" relationship remains the key to understanding the emergence/re-emergence of pathogenic viruses. High population density, rampant constructions, poor sanitation, changing climate, and the introduction of anthropophilic vectors create selective pressure on host-pathogen reservoirs. Nevertheless, the knowledge and understanding of such zoonoses and pathogen diversity in their known non-human reservoirs are very limited. Prevention of arboviral infections using vector control methods has not been very successful. Currently, new approaches to protect against food-borne infections, such as consuming only properly cooked meats and animal products, are the most effective control measures.

G.; Gedalof, Z.","Globally, colonialism resulted in the suppression of aboriginal land management practices, abetted by the concept of terra nullius, """"belonging to no one""""; the belief that aboriginal people had little influence on or ownership of the land. Until recently, this ideology was entrenched in resource management and policy. Traditional ecological knowledge, historical ecology, archaeology, and palaeoecological research have shown these assumptions to be wrong. In this paper we take a multidisciplinary approach (biogeography, paleoecology, dendrochronology, and bioclimatic envelope modeling) to better understand the role of climate and fire in the formation of eco-cultural landscapes. We synthesize results from pollen and charcoal analysis in Garry oak ecosystems that indicate there were continuous and frequent prescribed burning events, with more severe fires occurring every 26-41 years in southwest British Columbia throughout the Anthropocene (~last 250 years) that substantially altered forest structure and composition. These results are consistent with stand age reconstructions in BC and Washington with Garry oak establishment beginning ~1850 AD, corresponding with modern fire exclusion, aboriginal population decline, and end of the Little Ice Age. Douglas-fir recruitment has been continuous since ~1900, with succession of oak woodland to closed conifer forest at most sites. These findings indicate that the structure of many Garry oak ecosystems have been profoundly influenced by eco-cultural practices. Overwhelming evidence indicates that in many cases these ecosystems are dependent on prescribed fire for their open structure.

J.; Hayes, F.","Restoration ecologists have local- to global-scale ambitions in a policy framework of sustainable development goals and reversing biodiversity loss. Emphasis is given to environmental alteration, typically considering land degradation and climate change. Other related environmental drivers, such as pollution, receive less attention. Here we emphasize that terrestrial restoration discourse needs to consider tropospheric ozone (O3) pollution. O3's pervasive influence on plants and other ecosystem components provides for the possibility of consequences at community and ecosystem levels. The precursor chemicals that lead to O3 formation are increasing, precipitously so in rapidly industrializing regions of the world. Yet, a review of critical restoration guidance and journals suggests that because O3 is out of sight, it remains out of mind. Based on a narrative cross-discipline literature review, we examine: (1) How O3 could affect the achievement of restoration goals and (2) How restoration interventions could feedback on tropospheric O3. Evidence, currently limited, suggests that O3 could impair the achievement of restoration goals to as great an extent as other drivers, but, in general, we lack direct quantification. Restoration interventions (e.g. tree planting) that may be considered successful can actually exacerbate O3 pollution with negative consequences for food security and human health. These wide-ranging effects, across multiple goals, mean that O3 is not out of scope for restoration science, policy, and practice. In detailing a strategic ozone-aware restoration agenda, we suggest how restoration science and policy can quantify O3's influence, while outlining steps practitioners can take to adapt to/mitigate the impacts of O3 pollution.",2022,"","Restoration Ecology","30","7","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.13622","","#22038","Perring 2022","","Biophysical",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

H.; Franklin, J. F.; McComb, B.; Riegel, G.","Forests characterized by mixed-severity fires occupy a broad moisture gradient between lower elevation forests typified by low-severity fires and higher elevation forests in which high-severity, stand replacing fires are the norm. Mixed-severity forest types are poorly documented and little understood but likely occupy significant areas in the western United States. By definition, mixed-severity types have high beta diversity at meso-scales, encompassing patches of both high and low severity and gradients in between. Studies of mixed-severity types reveal complex landscapes in which patch sizes follow a power law distribution with many small and few large patches. Forest types characterized by mixed severity can be classified according to the modal proportion of high to low severity patches, which increases from relatively dry to relatively mesic site conditions. Mixed-severity regimes are produced by interactions between top-down forcing by climate and bottom-up shaping by topography and the flammability of vegetation, although specific effects may vary widely across the region, especially the relation between aspect and fire severity. History is important in shaping fire behavior in mixed-severity landscapes, as patterns laid down by previous fires can play a significant role in shaping future fires. Like low-severity forests in the western United States, many dry mixed-severity types experienced significant increases in stand density during the 20th century, threatening forest health and biodiversity, however not all understory development in mixed-severity forests increases the threat of severe wild fires. In general, current landscapes have been homogenized, reducing beta diversity and increasing the probability of large fires and insect outbreaks. Further loss of old, fire tolerant trees is of particular concern, but understory diversity has been reduced as well. High stand densities on relatively dry sites increase water use and therefore susceptibility to drought and insect outbreaks, exacerbating a trend of increasing regional drying.

Robust indicators reflecting the effects of climate change on the US and global water cycles are needed in order to appropriately manage water resources.

These indicators include average and heavy precipitation, standardized precipitation index, annual, 7-day low and 3-day high streamflow volume, streamflow timing, snow cover, snow water equivalent, groundwater level, lake water temperature, stream water temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, Palmer Drought Severity Index, water withdrawals, and water use. We also identify three indicators that could be included in the suite of water cycle and management indicators with some additional, directed work: snowfall, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture. Our conceptual framework focuses on known water cycle changes in addition to potential effects on management and addresses water quantity and quality, as well as water use and related interactions with freshwater ecosystems, societal impacts, and management. Water cycle indicators are organized into three categories: (1) hydrologic processes, (2) water quality processes, and (3) water quality and quantity impacts. Indicators described here are recommended to serve as critical references for periodic climate assessments.

A key question is how these changes will alter the provision of ecosystem services from the ocean, particularly from fisheries. To answer this question, we need to understand not only the ecological dynamics of marine systems, but also human adaptation and feedbacks between humans and the rest of the natural world. In this review, we outline what we have learned from research primarily in continental shelf ecosystems and fishing communities of North America. Key findings are that marine animals are highly sensitive to warming and are responding quickly to changes in water temperature, and that such changes are often happening faster than similar processes on land. Changes in species distributions and productivity are having substantial impacts on fisheries, including through changing catch compositions and longer distances traveled for fishing trips. Conflicts over access to fisheries have also emerged as species distributions are no longer aligned with regulations or catch allocations. These changes in the coupled natural-human system have reduced the value of ecosystem services from some fisheries and risk doing so even more in the future. Going forward, substantial opportunities for more effective fisheries management and operations, marine conservation, and marine spatial planning are likely possible through greater consideration of climate information over time-scales from years to decades.",2020,"","Special Feature: Marine ecosystem services: Ecological, socioeconomic and cultural sustainability.","63","1","17-26","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1438-390X.12050","","#22124","Pinsky 2020","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The scope of the synthesis was limited to the magnitude and timing of streamflow, stream temperature, suspended sediment, and aquatic invertebrate population dynamics. In general, the effects on hydrologic processes and watershed functions are greater following post-disturbance activities; climate change is anticipated to further negatively compound these natural disturbances. To maintain the resilience of watersheds (that is, the ability of natural systems to recover from perturbation), management activities should be designed to maintain natural hydrologic and ecosystem function wherever possible. Key considerations to maintain resilience include: planning management activities at the site, watershed and landscape scales, maximizing riparian overstory retention within 10 metres of streams, minimizing the introduction of fine sediments into surface water bodies, and monitoring the effects of disturbances and management interventions to support adaptive management.

These impacts, ranging from simple habitat loss to complex, interactive changes in ecosystem function, continue to accelerate even as the need grows for the resources provided by this biome. This """"Sagebrush Conservation Strategy-Challenges to Sagebrush Conservation"""", is an overview and assessment of the challenges facing land managers and landowners in conserving sagebrush ecosystems. This strategy is intended to provide guidance so that the unparalleled collaborative efforts to conserve the iconic greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) by State and Federal agencies, Tribes, academia, nongovernmental organizations, and stakeholders can be expanded to the entire sagebrush biome to benefit the people and wildlife that depend on this ecosystem. This report is organized into 3 parts. """"Part I. Importance of the Sagebrush Biome to People and Wildlife"""" introduces the biome and a subset of the more than 350 species of plants and animals associated with sagebrush for which there is some level of conservation concern. These include several sagebrush obligates that have been petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), including greater sage-grouse, Gunnison sage-grouse (C. minimus; listed as threatened), and pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis). Other sagebrush-dependent species, such as pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), have experienced significant population declines. """"Part II. Change Agents in the Sagebrush Biome-Extent, Impacts, and Effort to Address Them"""" is an overview of the variety of change agents that are causing the continued loss and degradation of sagebrush. Topics covered include altered fire regimes, invasive plant species, conifer expansion, overabundant free-roaming equids, and human land uses, including energy development, cropland conversion, infrastructure, and improper livestock grazing. Climate changes, including warmer temperatures and altered amounts and timing of precipitation, have and will likely increasingly compound negative effects to sagebrush ecosystems from all these threats. """"Part III. Current Conservation Paradigm and Other Conservation Needs for Sagebrush"""" begins with an overview of how sage-grouse conservation, and the associated efforts and collaborations, may be able to address threats to and restoring degraded sagebrush and habitat for other sagebrush-dependent and -associated species. Meeting conservation goals for sage-grouse, mule deer, pygmy rabbits, and other sagebrush-associated wildlife will require extensive restoration of sagebrush communities already converted or degraded by the change agents outlined in Part II of this report. Concepts, considerations, techniques for restoration, and adaptive management and monitoring are discussed to help set the stage for potential strategies to improve conditions throughout the sagebrush biome. Communication, outreach, and engagement can enhance grassroots conservation efforts and build the next generation of managers, practitioners, scientists, and communicators who will care for the sagebrush ecosystem and stimulate or sustain public participation in sagebrush conservation issues.",2021,"","Open-File Report - US Geological Survey","","2020-1125","xxxiv-pp","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20201125","","#22478","Remington 2021","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-26 00:23:13)(Select): Sagebrush exists at the Montana-Canada border, implying transboundary implications.

H.; Bernard, S. M.; Patz, J. A.","Exposure to waterborne and foodborne pathogens (e.g. bacteria, viruses and protozoa) can occur via drinking water (associated with faecal contamination), seafood (due to natural microbial hazards, toxins, or wastewater disposal) or fresh produce (irrigated or processed with contaminated water). Weather influences the transport and dissemination of these microbial agents via rainfall and runoff and the survival and/or growth through such factors as temperature. Federal and state laws and regulatory programmes protect much of the US population from waterborne disease; however, if climate variability increases, current and future deficiencies in areas such as watershed protection, infrastructure, and storm drainage systems will probably increase the risk of contamination events. Knowledge about transport processes and the fate of microbial pollutants associated with rainfall and snowmelt is key to predicting risks from a change in weather variability. Although recent studies identified links between climate variability and occurrence of microbial agents in water, the relationships need further quantification in the context of other stresses. In the marine environment as well, there are few studies that adequately address the potential health effects of climate variability in combination with other stresses such as overfishing, introduced species, and rise in sea level. Advances in monitoring are necessary to enhance early-warning and prevention capabilities. Application of existing technologies, such as molecular fingerprinting to track contaminant sources or satellite remote sensing to detect coastal algal blooms, could be expanded.

D.","Both gradual and extreme weather changes trigger complex ecological responses in river ecosystems. It is still unclear to what extent trend or event effects alter biodiversity and functioning in river ecosystems, adding considerable uncertainty to predictions of their future dynamics. Using a comprehensive database of 71 published studies, we show that event - but not trend - effects associated with extreme changes in water flow and temperature substantially reduce species richness. Furthermore, event effects - particularly those affecting hydrological dynamics - on biodiversity and primary productivity were twice as high as impacts due to gradual changes. The synthesis of the available evidence reveals that event effects induce regime shifts in river ecosystems, particularly affecting organisms such as invertebrates. Among extreme weather events, dryness associated with flow interruption caused the largest effects on biota and ecosystem functions in rivers. Effects on ecosystem functions (primary production, organic matter decomposition and respiration) were asymmetric, with only primary production exhibiting a negative response to extreme weather events. Our meta-analysis highlights the disproportionate impact of event effects on river biodiversity and ecosystem functions, with implications for the long-term conservation and management of river ecosystems. However, few studies were available from tropical areas, and our conclusions therefore remain largely limited to temperate river systems.

Preliminary findings suggest that this novel coronavirus - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might have originated in bats, and thereafter crossed the species barrier from an intermediate host; eventually spreading within humans. Bat coronaviruses are older than the coronaviruses identified in other animals and have shown a consistent growth rate. The diverse natures of coronaviruses in different bat species have witnessed repeated introductions and occasional establishment in other animal species. The dispersion of animal diseases and zoonotic pathogens is facilitated by rapid globalization, international trading and the ever-growing flow of goods and people. Climate change coupled with globalization and extensive deforestation can act as a significant selection pressure which can lead to onsets of future coronavirus transmission cycles. Climate change alters the availability of viable habitat for the hosts as well which results in the redistribution of host ranges and host densities relative to habitat resources.

G.","Increases in concentrations of greenhouse gases projected for the 21st century are expected to lead to increased mean global air and ocean temperatures. The National Assessment of Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change (NAST 2001) was based on a series of regional and sector assessments. This paper is a summary of the coastal and marine resources sector review of potential impacts on shorelines, estuaries, coastal wetlands, coral reefs, and ocean margin ecosystems. The assessment considered the impacts of several key drivers of climate change: sea level change; alterations in precipitation patterns and subsequent delivery of freshwater, nutrients, and sediment; increased ocean temperature; alterations in circulation patterns; changes in frequency and intensity of coastal storms; and increased levels of atmospheric CO2. Increasing rates of sea-level rise and intensity and frequency of coastal storms and hurricanes over the next decades will increase threats to shorelines, wetlands, and coastal development. Estuarine productivity will change in response to alteration in the timing and amount of freshwater, nutrients, and sediment delivery. Higher water temperatures and changes in freshwater delivery will alter estuarine stratification, residence time, and eutrophication. Increased ocean temperatures are expected to increase coral bleaching and higher CO2 levels may reduce coral calcification, making it more difficult for corals to recover from other disturbances, and inhibiting poleward shifts. Ocean warming is expected to cause poleward shifts in the ranges of many other organisms, including commercial species, and these shifts may have secondary effects on their predators and prey. Although these potential impacts of climate change and variability will vary from system to system, it is important to recognize that they will be superimposed upon, and in many cases intensify, other ecosystem stresses (pollution, harvesting, habitat destruction, invasive species, land and resource use, extreme natural events), which may lead to more significant consequences.",2002,"","Estuaries","25","2","149-164","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02691304","","#22988","Scavia 2002","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-27 05:47:20)(Select): gulf of mexico example as well, im considering gulf of mexico a transboundary water body and the paper discusses ecosystem impacts there so including; Laura  Dee (2024-08-23 07:32:58)(Select): US focused but mentions aquatic ecosystems and movementflows like gulf of maine and missouri river so not totally sure; ","Biophysical; Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

P.","The consequences of global warming and associated environmental changes for freshwater lakes and rivers in North America, are reviewed. Despite their generally isolated geographic locations, the freshwaters of the north are subjected to a wide spectrum of environmental stressors. High-latitude regions are especially sensitive to the effects of recent climatic warming, which have already resulted in marked regime shifts in the biological communities of many Arctic lakes and ponds. Important drivers of these limnological changes include changes in the amount and duration of snow and ice cover, and for rivers and lakes in their deltas, the frequency and extent of spring floods. Other important climate-related shifts include alterations in evaporation and precipitation ratios, marked changes in the quality and quantity of lake and river water inflows due to accelerated glacier and permafrost melting, and declining percentages of precipitation that falls as snow. The depletion of stratospheric ozone over the north, together with the clarity of many Arctic lakes, renders them especially susceptible to damage from ultraviolet radiation. In addition, the long-range atmospheric transport of pollutants, coupled with the focusing effects of contaminant transport from biological vectors to some local ecosystems (e.g., salmon nursery lakes, ponds draining seabird colonies) and biomagnification in long food chains, have led to elevated concentrations of many persistent organic pollutants (e.g., insecticides, which have never been used in Arctic regions) and other pollutants (e.g., mercury). Rapid development of gas and oil pipelines, mining for diamonds and metals, increases in human populations, and the development of all-season roads, seaports, and hydroelectric dams will stress northern aquatic ecosystems.

The modelling framework allows for an evaluation of different climate change scenarios generated by the global climate models. Temperature and precipitation are used as the main factors affecting flood flow generation. System dynamics modelling approach proved to be of great value in the development of system performance assessment model. The most important impact of climate variability and change on hydrologic processes is reflected in the change of flood patterns: flood starting time, peak value and timing. The results show increase in the annual precipitation and the annual streamflow volume in the Red River basin under the future climate change scenarios. Most of the floods generated using three different climate models had an earlier starting time and peak time. The assessment of the performance of Red River flood protection system is based on the flood flows, the capacity of flood control structures and failure flow levels at different locations in the basin. In the Assiniboine River Basin, higher reliabilities at downstream locations are obtained indicating that Shellmouth reservoir plays an important role in reducing downstream flooding. However, a different trend was identified in the Red River Basin.

C.","Rangeland social-ecological systems (SESs), which make up vast tracts of Earth's terrestrial surface, are facing unprecedented change-from climate change and vegetation transitions to large-scale shifts in human land use and changing social and economic conditions. Understanding how people who manage and depend on rangeland resources are adapting to change has been the focus of a rapidly growing body of research, which has the potential to provide important insights for climate change adaptation policy and practice. Here, we use quantitative, qualitative, and bibliometric analyses to systematically review the scope, methods, and findings of 56 studies that examine the social dimensions of adaptation in rangeland SESs. Our review focuses on studies within the climate adaptation, adaptive capacity, and adaptive decision-making sub-fields, finding that this body of research is highly diverse in its disciplinary roots and theoretical origins, and therefore uses a wide range of frameworks and indicators to evaluate adaptation processes. Bibliometric analyses revealed that the field is fragmented into distinct scholarly communities that use either adaptive capacity or adaptive decision-making frameworks, with a lack of cross-field citation. Given the strengths (and weaknesses) inherent in each sub-field, this review suggests that greater cross-pollination across the scholarship could lead to new insights, particularly for capturing cross-scale interactions related to adaptation on rangelands. Results also showed that a majority of studies that examine adaptation in either """"ranching"""" or """"rangeland"""" systems are geographically concentrated in few, high-income countries (i.e., USA, Australia, China), demonstrating a need to extend future research efforts to understudied regions of the globe with rangeland-based livelihoods.

The review shows that exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is having multiple organ-system effects across taxa, including impacts on neuroendocrine disruption, immune suppression and decreased bone density among others. Furthermore, the warming Arctic climate is suspected to influence abiotic and biotic long-range transport and exposure pathways of contaminants to the Arctic resulting in increases in POP exposure of both wildlife and human populations. Exposure to vector-borne diseases and zoonoses may increase as well through range expansion and introduction of invasive species. It will be important in the future to investigate the effects of these multiple stressors on wildlife and local people to better predict the individual-level health risks.

J.","The 1994 Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) was developed to resolve debates over old-growth forests, endangered species, and timber production on federal forests in the range of the northern spotted owl. This three-volume science synthesis, which consists of 12 chapters that address various ecological and social concerns, is intended to inform forest plan revision and forest management within the NWFP area. Land managers with the U.S. Forest Service provided questions that helped guide preparation of the synthesis, which builds on the 10-, 15-, and 20-year NWFP monitoring reports and synthesizes the vast body of relevant scientific literature that has accumulated in the 24 years since the NWFP was initiated. It identifies scientific findings, lessons learned, and uncertainties and also evaluates competing science and provides considerations for management. This synthesis finds that the NWFP has protected dense old-growth forests and maintained habitat for northern spotted owls, marbled murrelets, aquatic organisms, and other species despite losses from wildfire and low levels of timber harvest on federal lands. Even with reductions in the loss of older forests, northern spotted owl populations continue to decline. Moreover, a number of other goals have not been met, including producing a sustainable supply of timber, decommissioning roads, biodiversity monitoring, significant levels of restoration of riparian and dry forests, and adaptation and learning through adaptive management. New conservation concerns have arisen, including a major threat to spotted owl populations from expanding populations of the nonnative barred owl, effects of fire suppression on forest succession, fire behavior in dry forests, and lack of development of diverse early-seral vegetation as a result of fire suppression in drier parts of moist forests. Climate change and invasive species have emerged as threats to native biodiversity, and expansion of the wildland-urban interface has limited the ability of managers to restore fire to fire-dependent ecosystems. The policy, social, and ecological contexts for the NWFP have changed since it was implemented. The contribution of federal lands continues to be essential to the conservation and recovery of fish listed under the Endangered Species Act and northern spotted owl and marbled murrelet populations. Conservation on federal lands alone, however, is likely insufficient to reach the goals of the NWFP or the newer goals of the 2012 planning rule, which emphasizes managing for ecosystem goals (e.g. ecological resilience) and a few species of concern, rather than the population viability of hundreds of individual species. The social and economic basis of many traditionally forest-dependent communities have changed in 24 years, and many are now focused on amenity values. The capacities of human communities and federal agencies, collaboration among stakeholders, the interdependence of restoration and the timber economy, and the role of amenity- or recreation-based communities and ecosystem services are important considerations in managing for ecological resilience, biodiversity conservation, and social and economic sustainability. A growing body of scientific evidence supports the importance of active management or restoration inside and outside reserves to promote biodiversity and ecological resilience. Active management to promote heterogeneity of vegetation conditions is important to sustaining tribal ecocultural resources. Declines in agency capacity, lack of markets for small-diameter wood, lack of wood processing infrastructure in some areas, and lack of social agreement have limited the amount of active management for restoration on federal lands. All management choices involve social and ecological tradeoffs related to the goals of the NWFP. Collaboration, risk management, adaptive management, and monitoring are considered the best ways to deal with complex social and ecological systems with futures that are difficult to predict and affect through policy and land management actions.",2018,"","General Technical Report - Pacific Northwest Research Station, USDA Forest Service","","PNW-GTR-966(Vol. 3)","1020-pp","","","","#23511","Spies 2018","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-08-20 07:34:54)(Select): geographical focus on northwestern US but includes lots of flows that could be reasonably considered transboundary ;","Intervention",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Shifts have been idiosyncratic and in some cases counterintuitive, promoting new community compositions and altering biotic interactions. Although genetic diversity enhances species' potential to respond to variable conditions, climate change may outpace intrinsic adaptive capacities and increase the relative vulnerabilities of many organisms.

Although there are likely multiple contributing factors, such as climate and resource-related effects on breeding, migrating, and overwintering populations, the key landscape-level change appears to be associated with the widespread use of genetically modified herbicide resistant crops that have rapidly come to dominate the extensive core summer breeding range. We dismiss misinterpretations of the apparent lack of population change in summer adult count data as logically flawed. Glyphosate-tolerant soybean and maize have enabled the extensive use of this herbicide, generating widespread losses of milkweed (Asclepias spp.), the only host plants for monarch larvae. Modeling studies that simulate lifetime realized fecundity at a landscape scale, direct counts of milkweeds, and extensive citizen science data across the breeding range suggest that a herbicide-induced, landscape-level reduction in milkweed has precipitated the decline in monarchs.

Coupling the rich studies of life history and more recent explorations of genomic variation among invasions, we illustrate how eco-evolutionary dynamics shape the invasion success of this long-studied and widely distributed species. Especially informative is the comparison between Australian and North American invasions, because these populations colonized novel ranges concurrently and exhibit shared signals of selection despite distinct population histories. In this review, we describe population dynamics across the native and invasive ranges, identify putatively selected traits that may influence the starling's spread, and suggest possible determinants of starling success world-wide.

Species of the genus Quercus present an interesting case because of their economic and ecological importance, and their syngameon biology. As a model for exploring ecological diversification, and with recent advances in forest genomics, knowledge, data, and genomic resources for oak have accumulated and are summarized in this review to foster oaks as potential candidate species for future reforestation programs in Canadian natural, peri-urban, and urban ecosystems. We summarize the state of current genomic research in oak and the accompanying opportunities genomics can provide to achieve the potential of oak silviculture in Canada. Further, we highlight the socio-economic benefits of planting oaks and genomic tools for the development of a traceability system along the value chain. Finally, we discuss some of the remaining challenges to successfully integrate oaks into different forest management programs. In light of their increased drought resistance, oak species exhibit a strong potential as viable choices for future forests, resilient agricultural landscapes, and urban areas. By leveraging the progress made in oak genomics and the new applications that have been developed for commercial species, we can foster the successful management of oak genetic resources for the production of suitable seedlings, thereby aiding Canada in its ambitious pursuit of planting two billion trees to combat climate change.",2024,"","Tree Genetics and Genomes","20","3","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-024-01645-x","","#23896","Tischenko 2024","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is undertaking a series of studies to support a pending decision by the United States pertaining to the future of the Columbia River Treaty with Canada. The Treaty, ratified in 1964, is an agreement between the United States and Canada to provide flood control and power benefits for both countries. In these studies, information will be developed and alternatives evaluated that provide the basis for long-term recommendations pertaining to the future of the Treaty. Assumptions drawn regarding potential future climate changes and associated hydrologic impacts could have very significant influence on alternative Treaty strategies. For several decades climate scientists have provided an increasing array of knowledge and information on climate impacts. Climatic phenomena, such as summer and wintertime droughts, floods and wind storms, have greatly affected the Pacific Northwest in the last several decades. Observed data in the West is already showing signs of global warming - reductions in spring snowpack, earlier spring snowmelt, increased runoff in winter and less runoff in summer. These shifts may potentially increase flood risks in the early spring, and change the timing and volume of water in spring and early summer available for reservoir refill. Different parts of a basin may be affected differently by warming so that high elevation snowpack may experience minor impacts while low elevation sites may experience major changes Water resource managers have struggled to understand how to incorporate the knowledge provided by science into their planning and operations. This paper discusses a decision-making framework to bridge the gap between climate science and water management for the Columbia River Treaty 2014/2024 Review. The decision framework must be robust enough to accommodate risk characterization, screening and prioritization while allowing for adaptive management strategies that avoid maladaptations. Maladaptions are decisions that prevent or constrain the ability of others to manage, reduce or otherwise adapt to the effects of climate change in the future. Modeling systems used by the team will be capable of incorporating multiobjective analyses and alternative assessments running numerous future climate scenarios in physically based hydrologic, reservoir and hydraulic models that will ultimately support the decision-making framework.",2010,"","Innovations in Watershed Management under Land Use and Climate Change.

There is currently no consensus on the main drivers of the decline. Although climate change is expected to drive biodiversity loss in the future, current warming is often suggested to have positive impacts on pollinator assemblages in higher latitudes. Consequently, pollinator conservation initiatives in Europe and the USA tend to lack climate adaptation initiatives, an omission of which may be risky if climate change has significant negative impacts on pollinators. To gain an understanding of the impacts of climate change on pollinator biodiversity in the Northern Hemisphere, we conducted a literature review on genetic, species and community level diversity. Our findings suggest that global heating most likely causes homogenization of pollinator assemblages at all levels of pollinator biodiversity, making them less resilient to future stochasticity. Aspects of biodiversity that are rarely measured (e.g. genetic diversity, beta-diversity, species evenness) tend to be most affected, while some dimensions of climate change, such as fluctuations in winter weather conditions, changes in the length of the vegetational season and increased frequency of extreme weather events, that seldom receive attention in empirical studies, tend to be particularly detrimental to pollinators. Negative effects of global heating on pollinator biodiversity are most likely exacerbated by homogenous and fragmented landscapes, widespread across Europe and the US, which limit opportunities for range-shifts and reduce micro-climatic buffering. This suggests the need for conservation initiatives to focus on increasing landscape connectivity and heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales.",2021,"","Science of the Total Environment","775","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145788","","#24082","Vasiliev 2021","Meagan Oldfather (2024-10-04 07:14:26)(Select): Range shifts of pollinators are discussed with examples from North America, but not transboundary range shifts not discussed; How pollinator decline varies across boundaries may also be relevant to shifts in agriculture ; Tyler McIntosh (2024-09-11 05:54:04)(Select): c1: yes

The disease seems to be underestimated, especially in countries located in the temperate climatic zone. The presented article concerns the main characteristics of leptospirosis and describes formerly known and recently observed environmental, occupational and recreational risk factors significant in the spreading and pathogenesis of the disease. The aspects of epidemiology significant in the temperate climatic zone are emphasized. The majority of cited articles present cases of the disease reported from Europe or North America. Climatic changes (warming) and extreme weather events such as floods are potential risk factors of leptospirosis. Also, some socio-economic phenomena, such as the intensive migration of people resulting in the transfer of the infections acquired in tropical countries, or worsening of economic status in the cities, increase the probability of disease. Apart from the danger connected with rodents, which are the main vectors of leptospires, occurrence of the disease in dogs and cats can generate a higher risk of infection for humans. Infections may also be acquired during various types of agricultural work and during recreational activities, such as swimming. The results of recent investigations show that ticks are also potential vectors of leptospires. The more frequent emergence of leptospirosis in countries located in the temperate climatic zone emphasize the need to verify knowledge related to the risk of its appearance, and to consider this disease during diagnostic processes.",2013,"","Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine","20","2","239-244","","","","#24345","Wasinski 2013","","Biotic; Human movement; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

D.","Boreal forest fire regime, which encompasses fire intensity, frequency, seasonality, size, type (crown versus surface), and severity (depth of burn), is an organizing factor of boreal forest landscapes and highly dependant on climate. This review combines what is known about boreal forest dynamics from palaeological studies, with the information derived from state-of-the-art climate and vegetation modelling, to present possible scenarios of the impact of anticipated climate change on boreal forest ecosystem structure and function, particularly in relation to fire regimes. Anticipated climatic/atmospheric impact on plant physiological, communal, ecosystem, and finally landscape-level interactions with fire are reviewed. All indications from the modelling sector point towards unprecedented increased regional or seasonal temperatures, with projected changes most pronounced at high latitudes and there greatest in winter. Anticipated climate change scenarios are expected to alter dramatically the boreal forest ecosystems and fire regimes with which they are currently in equilibrium. Changed fire regimes could be represented by increased annual area burned because of an extended fire season, increased fire frequency, and severity. Simulation studies show the potential for greatly reduced boreal forest area and increased fragmentation due to climate change. Fire regime as an ecosystem process is highly sensitive to climate change because fire behaviour responds immediately to fuel moisture, which is affected by precipitation, relative humidity, air temperature, and wind speed. This interaction between climate change and fire regime has the potential to overshadow the importance of the direct effects of global warming on species distribution, migration, substitution, and extinction. Such a scenario suggests that rate and magnitude of fire-regime-induced changes to the boreal forest landscape could greatly exceed anything expected due to atmospheric warming alone. Socioeconomic implications of altered fire regimes in a changing climate are discussed in terms of adaptive fire management strategies, age class distribution, and such global stewardship issues as biodiversity, carbon cycling, and sequestration.",1997,"","Environmental Reviews","5","3/4","145-166","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/a97-008","","#24370","Weber 1997","","Biophysical; Intervention; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The first objective was to combine data from community observation studies and dietary interview studies to determine potential climate change impacts on nutritional quality. The second objective was to address the scale of data collection and/or availability to compare local versus regional trends, and identify implications for adaptation planning. Information was compiled from 5 reports (4 community reports and 1 synthesis report) of climate change observations, impacts and adaptations in 12 Inuit communities (2005-2006), and from a dietary report of food use from 18 Inuit communities (1997-2000). Changing access to, availability of, quality of, and ability to use traditional food resources has implications for quality of diet. Nutritional implications of lower traditional food use include likely reductions in iron, zinc, protein, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids, among others. The vulnerability of each community to changing food security is differentially influenced by a range of factors, including current harvesting trends, levels of reliance on individual species, opportunities for access to other traditional food species, and exposure to climate change hazards.

G.; Manning, S. T.; Waugh, J. D.; Ziska, L. H.; Dukes, J. S.","Over the past 50 years, considerable effort has been made by state and national agencies as well as other partners to minimize the establishment and spread of newly introduced and/or emerging invasive plants through single agency-led programmes, inter-agency councils and task forces and, most recently, the landscape approach to early detection and rapid response (EDRR). Examples of single agency-led programmes include the USDA-Carolinas Witchweed Eradication Program in the USA and the Kochia Eradication Project in Western Australia (EDRR 1.0). In recent years, state inter-agency councils and task forces have been formed to address all types of new invasive species - particularly newly introduced species that are not already regulated by federal or state agencies. The Delaware Invasive Species Council, the Ontario Invasive Plant Council and the Beach Vitex Task Force are good examples of this new trend in inter-agency partnering (EDRR 2.0). The landscape approach to EDRR involves the development of EDRR capacity at all levels of the landscape - local to national. It includes individual public and private land units, geographic land units (watersheds, biomes, corridors, etc.) and political land units (towns, counties, states/provinces and nations) (EDRR 3.0). From a societal standpoint, due to global climate change and increased global trade and travel, it is important to emphasize that the impacts of invasive species on food security, human health, and biodiversity will continue to increase unless steps are taken now to minimize their introduction, establishment and spread.

G.; Collatz, G. J.","Disturbances are a major determinant of forest carbon stocks and uptake. They generally reduce land carbon stocks but also initiate a regrowth legacy that contributes substantially to the contemporary rate of carbon stock increase in US forestlands. As managers and policy makers increasingly look to forests for climate protection and mitigation, and because of increasing concern about changes in disturbance intensity and frequency, there is a need for synthesis and integration of current understanding about the role of disturbances and other processes in governing forest carbon cycle dynamics, and the likely future of this and other sinks for atmospheric carbon. This paper aims to address that need by providing a quantitative review of the distribution, extent and carbon impacts of the major disturbances active in the US. We also review recent trends in disturbances, climate, and other global environmental changes and consider their individual and collective contributions to the US carbon budget now and in the likely future. Lastly, we identify some key challenges and opportunities for future research needed to improve current understanding, advance predictive capabilities, and inform forest management in the face of these pressures. Harvest is found to be the most extensive disturbance both in terms of area and carbon impacts, followed by fire, windthrow and bark beetles, and lastly droughts. Collectively these lead to the gross loss of about 200 Tg C y-1 in live biomass annually across the conterminous US. At the same time, the net change in forest carbon stocks is positive (190 Tg C y-1), indicating not only forest resilience but also an apparently large response to growth enhancements such as fertilization by CO2 and nitrogen. Uncertainty about disturbance legacies, disturbance interactions, likely trends, and global change factors make the future of the US forest carbon sink unclear. While there is scope for management to enhance carbon sinks in US forests, tradeoffs with other values and uses are likely to significantly limit practical implementation. Continued and expanded remote sensing and field-based monitoring capabilities and manipulative experimentation are needed to improve understanding of the US forest carbon sink, and assess how disturbance processes are responding to the pressures of global environmental change. In addition, continued development and application of holistic, decision support tools that consider a range of forest values are needed to enable managers and policy makers to use the best available information for guiding forest resources now and into the future.",2016,"","Global and Planetary Change","143","","66-80","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2016.06.002","","#24485","Williams 2016","Matthew Schumm (2024-09-07 04:51:44)(Select): Figure 1 implies disturbances of forests up to and including transnational boundaries, which they describe as being exacerbated by climate change.; ","Biophysical; Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

L.; Yarie, J.","The structure and function of Alaska's forests have changed significantly in response to a changing climate, including alterations in species composition and climate feedbacks (e.g., carbon, radiation budgets) that have important regional societal consequences and human feedbacks to forest ecosystems. In this paper we present the first comprehensive synthesis of climate-change impacts on all forested ecosystems of Alaska, highlighting changes in the most critical biophysical factors of each region. We developed a conceptual framework describing climate drivers, biophysical factors and types of change to illustrate how the biophysical and social subsystems of Alaskan forests interact and respond directly and indirectly to a changing climate. We then identify the regional and global implications to the climate system and associated socio-economic impacts, as presented in the current literature. Projections of temperature and precipitation suggest wildfire will continue to be the dominant biophysical factor in the Interior-boreal forest, leading to shifts from conifer- to deciduous-dominated forests. Based on existing research, projected increases in temperature in the Southcentral- and Kenai-boreal forests will likely increase the frequency and severity of insect outbreaks and associated wildfires, and increase the probability of establishment by invasive plant species. In the Coastal-temperate forest region snow and ice is regarded as the dominant biophysical factor. With continued warming, hydrologic changes related to more rapidly melting glaciers and rising elevation of the winter snowline will alter discharge in many rivers, which will have important consequences for terrestrial and marine ecosystem productivity. These climate-related changes will affect plant species distribution and wildlife habitat, which have regional societal consequences, and trace-gas emissions and radiation budgets, which are globally important. Our conceptual framework facilitates assessment of current and future consequences of a changing climate, emphasizes regional differences in biophysical factors, and points to linkages that may exist but that currently lack supporting research.

J.; Hoek, J. van den; Walters, A.; Devenish, A.","This report assesses and maps 184 peer-reviewed, empirical research articles selected for their focus on linkages between water stress and human migration. First and most importantly, this literature asserts that migration is universal. Migration is an extremely common social process and is normal in almost every society on earth. Moreover, migration is not a pathological response to environmental change. Environment-influenced migration is rarely (if ever) a resource threat to the regions to which people move. The literature does, however, observe that negative social outcomes can result from narratives that stigmatize migrants and/or cast migrants as a security threat - especially when these narratives are used to justify increased surveillance and monitoring of these people. A number of the reviewed articles argue for the adoption of proactive policies and programmes that seek to reduce migration. Typically, these articles identify a case for investment in sustainable agriculture and rural livelihood diversification. In water-stressed areas, experience suggests that such policies and programmes can both slow rural-urban migration and reduce the incentive for people to attempt to move across international borders out of desperation rather than out of choice. The literature reveals a strong consensus that increased water stress can cause people to decide to migrate. There also appears to be a consensus that increasing mean temperatures are correlated with, and are thought to be a cause of, increased water stress. As temperatures rise, water stress may result from less water, increases in evaporation, and increases in agricultural water demand. But the link between temperature and water stress is not unique to drought. Recent papers demonstrate that a combination of higher temperatures and rainfall extremes are correlated with increases in migration rates away from areas where these changes can be observed. This being said, the causal interaction of temperature, water stress and migration is still not clearly understood. More systematic studies are needed. In an effort to determine where further empirical research may be justified, we initially map the distribution of reviewed articles at the sub-basin level and then compare these data with expected future changes in surface temperature and precipitation. Examination of these maps suggests that linkages between water stress and migration are understudied in India, Central Asia, the Middle East, and the Central Sahel. As data transparency is low and/or insecurity makes field data collection difficult in some of these areas, the use of novel data-gathering techniques, such as crowd-sourcing, passive data collection from digital devices and remotely sensed data, is suggested as a way to speed progress.",2018,"","FAO Land and Water Discussion Paper","","11","ix-pp","","","","#24568","Wrathall 2018","","Biophysical; Human movement",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

E.

The pest causes considerable costs annually coupled with its strong invasion propensity. Temperature is identified as the dominant abiotic factor affecting herbivorous insects. Several efforts have reported that temperature directly or indirectly influences the geographic distribution, phenology and natural enemies of the poikilothermal FAW, and thus may affect the damage to crops, e.g., the increased developmental rate accelerates the intake of crops at higher temperatures. Under some extreme temperatures, the FAW is likely to regulate various genes expression in response to environmental changes, which causes a wider viability and possibility of invasion threat. Therefore, this paper seeks to review and critically consider the variations of developmental indicators, the relationships between the FAW and its natural enemies and the temperature tolerance throughout its developmental stage at varying levels of heat/cold stress.

Doing this requires concentrated efforts in a variety of areas to advance the technological state of the art and at the same time implement ideas and explain to the everyday citizen what is happening. The world's experience with COVID-19 has revealed many gaps in our past approaches to anticipating emerging infectious diseases. Most approaches to predicting outbreaks and identifying emerging microbes of major consequence have been with those causing high morbidity and mortality in humans and animals. These lagging indicators offer limited ability to prevent disease spillover and amplifications in new hosts. Leading indicators and novel approaches are more valuable and now feasible, with multidisciplinary approaches also within our grasp to provide links to disease predictions through holistic monitoring of micro and macro ecological changes. In this commentary, we describe niches for climate change and infectious diseases as well as overarching themes for the important role of collaborative team science, predictive analytics, and biosecurity.

The expansion of dengue is expected to increase due to factors such as climate change, globalization, international travel and trade, socioeconomics, settlement and dengue viral evolution. Transmission of dengue is now present in more than 125 countries known to be dengue endemic. Estimates of the global incidence of dengue infections annually have ranged between 50 million and 200 million; however, recent estimates using cartographic approaches suggest the data is closer to 400 million. Currently no vaccine or specific antiviral therapy exists to address the growing threat of dengue. Prompt case detection and appropriate clinical management can reduce the mortality from severe dengue. Effective vector control is the mainstay of dengue prevention and control.

(Lindsey E.), 1958-","""""Decades of study on climatic change and its direct and indirect effects on forest ecosystems provide important insights for forest science, management, and policy. A synthesis of recent research from the northeastern United States and eastern Canada shows that the climate of the region has become warmer and wetter over the past 100 years and that there are more extreme precipitation events. Greater change is projected in the future. The amount of projected future change depends on the emissions scenarios used. Tree species composition of northeast forests has shifted slowly in response to climate for thousands of years. However, current human-accelerated climate change is much more rapid and it is unclear how forests will respond to large changes in suitable habitat. Projections indicate significant declines in suitable habitat for spruce-fir forests and expansion of suitable habitat for oak-dominated forests. Productivity gains that might result from extended growing seasons and carbon dioxide and nitrogen fertilization may be offset by productivity losses associated with the disruption of species assemblages and concurrent stresses associated with potential increases in atmospheric deposition of pollutants, forest fragmentation, and nuisance species. Investigations of links to water and nutrient cycling suggest that changes in evapotranspiration, soil respiration, and mineralization rates could result in significant alterations of key ecosystem processes. Climate change affects the distribution and abundance of many wildlife species in the region through changes in habitat, food availability, thermal tolerances, species interactions such as competition, and susceptibility to parasites and disease. Birds are the most studied northeastern taxa. Twenty-seven of the 38 bird species for which we have adequate long-term records have expanded their ranges predominantly in a northward direction. There is some evidence to suggest that novel species, including pests and pathogens, may be more adept at adjusting to changing climatic conditions, enhancing their competitive ability relative to native species. With the accumulating evidence of climate change and its potential effects, forest stewardship efforts would benefit from integrating climate mitigation and adaptation options in conservation and management plans.""""",2012,"01-01","Changing climate, changing forests","","","","","","","#25029","Rustad 2012","Anabel Kinsey (2024-08-09 13:49:01)(Select): HOW IS WILDLIFE IN NORTHEAST FORESTS RESPONDING

"473","Forest ecosystems of temperate climatic regions: from ancient use to climate change","Gilliam, Frank S"," 871I.I. IntroductionForest ecosystems have always been an integral part of human existence, whether as a source of food, fiber, and habitat, as an essential component in maintaining the atmospheric balance of O2 and CO2, or as a source of musical, artistic, or poetic inspiration.Gilliam I chose to begin my book on the ecology of herbaceous communities of forests of eastern North America with this statement for both personal and professional reasons. I suspect that many, if not most, people who have had direct contact with forests eventually grow to establish an intimate connection with them, and at a variety of levels. It was such a personal intimacy that led to my scientific study of them. As this is a Tansley review, it is an appropriate aside to note that Sir Arthur Tansley himself conveyed a special sense of awe regarding forests, more specifically the Kingley Vale in his native England (Fig. ), which offered a view that Tansley considered 'the finest in England,' a place that held both spiritual and professional significance for him, first as an 11-yr-old boy and later as an international leader in the field of plant ecology (Ayres, ).Although humans have long utilized resources associated with all forest biomes - tropical, subtropical, temperate and boreal - I suggest that it is the expanse of human populations in the temperate region that has left the most indelible anthropogenic signature among forested regions. Certainly, deforestation in the tropics has been, and continues to be, a serious environmental concern, for example, with projected loss of forest cover being up to 40% for the Amazon Basin by 2050 (Soares-Fihlo et al., ), and a global annual loss rate of 0.4% (Hansen et al., ; Malhi et al., ). However, a far greater relative fraction of the original extent of temperate forests of the eastern United States has at one time been harvested, with estimates of < 1% of these original forests remaining as primary (old-growth) forests (Davis, ). Older examples of anthropogenic alteration are wide-spread in Central Europe, where forest conversion dates back to the Neolithic Period (EEA, ). Dambrine et al.  found evidence for 2000-yr-old ecological legacies created by temperate forest conversion and subsequent agricultural practices by the Romans in central France. Older still is the human imprint left on temperate forests of China, wherein extensive forest alteration dates back some 6000 yr before present (BP), to such an extent that the roles of climate and anthropogenic disturbance are essentially confounded in understanding long-term patterns of change in vegetation (Liu, ). Thus, if there is a common theme across the global distribution of temperate forests, it is that the human imprint on them is indelibly large and deep, and more so than with any other forest biome type.The term 'global change' is a collective term to describe anthropogenic modification of all aspects of the global environment that has the potential to alter the sustainability of the Earth for life. Often erroneously used interchangeably with anthropogenic climate change (hereafter, simply 'climate change'), global change comprises not only climate change, but also other essential facets of environmental change that interact with climate change, including land use, modification of local and regional hydrological cycles, changes in biogeochemical cycles, and biodiversity loss (Vitousek, ; Steffen et al., ; Franklin et al., ). Clearly, global change is not only quite evident in all temperate forests of the world, but also it has long been so.Indeed, there is an ancient legacy of human alteration of landscapes of temperate forests on a global scale. In North America, notable evidence suggests that, far before the arrival of Europeans, use of fire by Native American peoples greatly impacted the composition of eastern hardwood forests, especially regarding tree species of masting or fruiting value, either directly for food or indirectly for game forage (Kay & Simmons, ). Even the English landscape that was so dear to Tansley (e.g. the Kingley Vale panorama; Fig. ) was anything but pristine wilderness, given widespread deforestation of the English landscape by Romans 2000 yr BP (Williams, ). These observations challenge the very notion of what truly constitutes a primary or pristine state. Further, global change should never be considered a solely recent, modern phenomenon.New terminology has recently been developed to address this awareness. Ellis et al.  quantified anthropogenic change of global biomes (anthromes). Even our current epoch - the Holocene - is increasingly being referred to as the Anthropocene considering wide temporal and spatial scales of human alteration of all facets of the biosphere, from domestication of animal species and conversion of vast areas of land for cultivation, to long-term changes in atmospheric chemistry (Steffen et al., ; Ellis, ; Lewis & Maslin, ).Ellis  conceptualized how humans, more than any other multicellular organism, have transformed Earth's ecosystems, including temperate forests, leading to what he calls anthroecology theory. Figure  provides a visual representation of this theory for a temperate woodland. Beginning with earliest human inhabitation of the Earth, human populations have not only expanded in number, but have also changed socio-culturally, from hunter-gatherer, to horticultural, eventually to our current industrial status. The result has been chronic anthropogenic change in land use and cover, patterns of energy consumption, ecosystem properties (e.g. carbon flux and nutrient cycling) and ecosystem state (from 'wild' to 'novel' to 'used') (Fig. ). This provides a conceptual framework for this review, as it links ancient use of temperate forests to current patterns of climate change.The purpose of this review is to bring into focus the diverse forests of the temperate region of the biosphere, with particular emphasis on crucial challenges for the future of temperate forests. Although these are generally found between 20° and 60° in each of the north and south latitudes, because land mass distribution of the biosphere is decidedly asymmetrical (more land occurring north of the equator) and due to a variety of climatic, oceanographic, and orographic factors, temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere lack the widespread nature of their northern counterparts. Consequently, somewhat more emphasis will be placed on temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere.871II.II. A brief biogeography and history of temperate forestsIn North America, temperate forests span most of the eastern United States as hardwoods of widely varying species dominance, with conifer and mixed (conifer/hardwood) forests occurring in parts of the southeast, west and, especially, the Pacific Northwest, from the coastal United States into Canada. Temperate forests dominate essentially all of England and northern Europe, with a narrow band reaching far into Russia, much of eastern China and virtually all of Japan (Fig. ). Distributions of temperate forests are more restricted in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere, including southern Chile, southeastern Australia and all of Tasmania, and parts of New Zealand, including all of the North Island, where it is referred to as oceanic temperate forest (McGlone et al., ). Temperate conifers tend to dominate in more extreme conditions (e.g. cold climates and/or infertile soils) (Reich & Frelich, ; Waring, ), or in fire-dominated regions (e.g. the southeastern Coastal Plain and western regions of the USA), although conifer dominance in other regions (e.g. North American Pacific Northwest) has been ascribed to unusually long photosynthetic seasons arising from mild winters with abundant rainfall (Givnish, ) (Fig. ).The predominant climate of most of these forest regions is one of distinct cyclic, seasonal changes involving periods of growth and dormancy. Specific temporal patterns of seasonal change, however, display impressive variability among temperate forest regions, a function of latitude (longer growing seasons toward at lower latitudes), topographic features (e.g. mountains) and proximity to oceans with marine currents of varying prevailing temperatures. The latter is evidenced by the development of temperate rainforests associated with coastal main lands or islands, including the Pacific coast of North America and small areas of Great Britain and Japan, and throughout most of southern Chile, southeastern Australia and southern New Zealand (Alaback, ).Geological history and soil formation also vary greatly among temperate forests, thus precluding broad generalizations (Bally & Palmer, ; Ponge et al., ). In North America the geological (continental) structure is generally symmetrical, beginning with the middle outward including shield, interior lowlands, mountains, coastal plains, continental shelves and ocean basins. By contrast, Eurasia lacks such symmetry, with Europe being geologically separated from Asia by the Ural Mountains (King, ). Thus, the broad spatial patterns of soil formation in North America contrast sharply with those for Asia (Bally & Palmer, ; Ponge et al., ; King, ).One aspect of geological history shared among temperate forests is the profound effects of glaciation (Clark et al., ). Most relevant is the occurrence of the last glacial maximum (LGM), a period of widespread surface ice that ended c. 20 000 yr bp (Yokoyama et al., ). Given the extent of LGM glaciers (Fig. a,b), any exposition of temperate forests necessitates at least a perfunctory understanding of their widespread nature. Glaciations of the LGM even have a diverse nomenclature, based on global location (Ehlers & Gibbard, ). Prominent in the Northern Hemisphere were the Wisconsin glaciation in North America and the Devensian,Wurm and Weichselian glaciations in the British Isles, Alps and Northern/Central Europe, respectively. In the Southern Hemisphere, LGM glaciers include the Llanquihue and Otira glaciations in Chile and New Zealand, respectively.Despite their widespread occurrence, temperate forests of many regions are similar in development toward their present state. Most of the Northern Hemisphere was once dominated by the Arcto-Tertiary geoflora (Cain, ; Axelrod, ; Whittaker, ). This was a time (c. 15 Myr BP) of a far warmer global climate than the present one, which was especially pronounced toward polar areas. Within this expansive forest were numerous gymnosperm genera, such as Cedrus,Picea,Pinus and Tsuga, and angiosperm genera - Acer,Betula,Carya,Corylus,Castanea,Fagus,Magnolia,Quercus,Tilia,Ulmus and Liquidambar (Xiang et al., ; Graham, ). Increased warming during the Tertiary yielded to the cooler Quaternary, leading to the massive glaciers of the LGM over much of what is now boreal forest throughout the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. a). This pushed many species south toward the unglaciated refugia (e.g. Appalachian Mountains), which may have provided sources of remigration of species toward their current distributions (Davis, ; Graham, ; Stebich et al., ).Interestingly, the LGM is essentially irrelevant for temperate forests of China, largely unaffected by Quaternary glaciation (Liu, ). Pollen records reveal a diverse assemblage of tree genera at this time, varying from mixed conifer-hardwood to deciduous to widespread subtropical broadleaved evergreen forests; hardwoods comprised genera similar to other temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere, with a diverse oak (Quercus) flora (Liu, ). Stratigraphy of mid-Holocene pollen demonstrates a period of maximum warmth (i.e. the Hypsithermal). Throughout northern regions at this time, forests increased in diversity with thermophilous hardwoods expanding, replacing both pine and, toward the south, birch (Liu, ).Although glaciation also occurred in the Southern Hemisphere, other processes were equally significant in determining its temperate forest tree flora, including higher sea-to-land ratios creating conditions leading to temperate rain forests on west-facing coasts (Alaback, ) and species of Nothofagus and conifers of the families Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae (Beard, ; Kershaw & Wagstaff, ). During the Tertiary Period, drying occurred in continental regions, selecting more xeromorphic and even pyrophilic, fire-tolerant genera, such as Eucalyptus (Beard, ).Fire - typically more prevalent among conifer-dominated stands than hardwood-dominated stands - has long been an integral factor in directing the development of temperate forest ecosystems. Marlon et al.  used the paleorecord to examine the relationship between abrupt changes in global climate and enhanced frequency of fire. Using data from 35 charcoal/pollen records in North America to assess change in fire regimes during the past 15-10 kyr (the latest glacial-interglacial transition, and a time of profound climate change), they found clear links between fire frequency and degree of climate change. Implicit in their evidence is the intimate connection between occurrence of fire and the development of drought conditions in forested regions.874III.III. Climate, soils, composition and land use1. North AmericaTemperate forests of North America occur in the eastern United States primarily as hardwood forests (except for extreme high elevations and southeastern Coastal Plain pinelands) and as conifer and mixed forests in parts of the western United States and Canada. Using the Köppen-Geiger climate classification (Kottek et al., ), the predominant eastern climate would be classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) to the south, and humid continental (Dfa) to the north; prevailing climates for western forests are predominantly warm temperate (Csb), with boreal zone-like conditions (Dfc) at high elevations of central western USA. Winter climate is dominated by fluctuations between cold, dry arctic air, along with cyclonic storms with marine-derived moisture to produce occasional heavy snows. Winter temperatures vary from means of -5°C in the north to 10°C toward the south. Spring brings thunderstorm activity through mixing of cold polar air with moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. Mean summer temperatures throughout the region range from 20° to 27°C. Frost-free periods are generally between 120 and 150 d in the north to > 250 d in the south. Mean annual precipitation is 80-140 cm (Archibold, ). The prevailing climate of the Pacific Northwest forests is largely maritime, varying with latitude and elevation, with precipitation increasing with elevation (Franklin & Halpern, ).Soils of eastern forests are generally Alfisols, Inceptisols and Ultisols, glaciated towards the north (Fig. a). Unglaciated soils are old, with soil pH decreasing with age. Soils of western forests are spatially variable. Montane conifer forest soils are usually young, derived from granites, gneisses and schists (Peet, ). Pacific Northwest conifer forest soils comprise Ultisols, Inceptisols and Spodosols, with many soils of volcanic origin (Franklin & Halpern, ).With the exception of the virtual elimination of the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) by the chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) beginning in 1904, current eastern temperate forest types are largely similar to those originally described by Braun . With the highest tree diversity occurring in the mixed mesophytic forest region of the Appalachians, dominant genera include oaks (Quercus spp.), maples (Acer spp.), hickories (Carya spp.) and birch (Betula spp.), along with American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera).Conifer forests vary greatly within the broad temperate region of North America. At the higher elevations throughout the Appalachian mountain range (800-1200 m above sea level (asl) in New England to 1600 m asl in the Great Smoky Mountains), spruce (Abies spp.) and fir (Picea spp.) forests are common (Vankat, ). Southeastern Coastal Plain conifer forests are predominantly pines (Pinus spp.) of a primarily successional nature, the result of frequent natural (e.g. fire) and anthropogenic (e.g. harvesting) disturbances (Platt et al., ); these typically change through secondary succession to Quercus-Carya forests (Peet et al., ). Before European settlement c. 250 yr bp, this region was dominated by a single species - Pinus palustris - which is currently < 3% of its original distribution (Gilliam & Platt, ).Montane conifer forests of western North America contain more genera than those of the eastern United States. Important genera include fir (Abies spp.), juniper (Juniperus spp.), spruce (Picea spp.), pine (Pinus spp.), hemlock (Tsuga spp.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Some of these form mixed forests, especially those associated with elevation gradients and successional status following disturbances, such as fire; hardwoods include maple (Acer spp.), alder (Alnus spp.), poplar (Populus spp.) and mountain ash (Sorbus spp.) (Peet, ). The mild, moist climate of Pacific Northwest (coastal forests west of the Cascade crest) selects for a complex assortment of conifer species, including Pseudotsuga menziesii,Tsuga spp., Abies spp., Pinus spp. and several genera of cedars (family Cupressaceae, e.g. Calocedrus,Chamaecyparis,Thuja), including the awe-inspiring redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), the tallest tree in the world (Franklin & Halpern, ).2. EuropeThe European Environment Agency divides Europe into 11 biogeographical regions, based on prevailing climate and proximity to bodies of water (EEA, ). Regions most germane to this discussion are the Atlantic, Black Sea, Continental and Pannonian, with Continental occupying by far the largest area (Finnie et al., ). Temperate forests here are predominantly hardwood species, with conifer forests increasing in importance toward the north and with increasing elevation. These extend farther east into western Russia, wherein climate becomes increasingly continental and drier, contrasting with the maritime climate toward the west. The climate throughout this area ranges from temperate oceanic (Do) in the west to temperate continental (Dc) eastward (Kottek et al., ). Winter temperatures vary from maritime means of 3° to 5°C to continental means of -4° to -15°C in central Russia. Mean summer temperatures generally range from 22° to 30°C. Mean annual precipitation is 50-75 cm, with snow uncommon in lowland parts of Europe (Archibold, ).Many of the soils of Europe often are referred to collectively as brown earths, which are similar to North American Alfisols, except that many are developed from calcareous parent materials wherein they are more similar to Inceptisols. Other common soils are Spodosols, especially in northern latitudes (Jones et al., ).Human alteration of temperate forests over recent millennia is perhaps most pronounced here (Mitchell & Cole, ; Niklasson et al., ), where only c. 25% of forests are considered primary (sensu FAO, : 'forest of native species where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes have not been significantly disturbed'), something that disconnects forest distribution with climate (Allen et al., ). Evidence suggests that anthropogenic disturbance began there in the Neolithic, with widespread forest conversion beginning c. 7000 yr BP (EEA, ). Since these ancient times, forest condition has been closely linked with human populations and socio-economic development. Both historical and paleo-ecological records indicate periods not only of increased logging, but also of land abandonment and forest regrowth, including the plague years of the 1300s (EEA, ).There are generally fewer tree species in Europe than in North America, a contrast further exacerbated by extensive planting of conifer species throughout hardwood ranges (Augusto et al., ). Despite this, the two regions share many deciduous genera, including Quercus,Acer,Betula,Ulmus and Fagus (Pages & Michalet, ; Ellenberg, ). EEA  recognizes a mesophytic deciduous forest type, quite analogous to that which dominates the eastern United States. Analogous to chestnut blight in eastern USA, European species of Ulmus, especially white elm (U. laevis), have been decimated by the Dutch elm disease (Ophiostoma ulmi), which has also decimated elm species of North America (Peterken, ).The current extent of European temperate conifer forests is greatly modified by past and current policies to plant vast areas of productive conifer species. Again, widespread native deciduous forests have been replaced by conifer plantations, modifying the general composition of the western European temperate forest. Although some of these were transplanted from within Europe (e.g. Norway spruce, Picea abies and Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris), others were imported from North America (e.g. Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis and Douglas fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii) (Augusto et al., ). Not surprisingly, then, as with hardwood genera, predominant European conifer genera overlap greatly with those of North America, including Abies,Picea and Pinus (EEA, ).3. AsiaSimilar to their North American counterparts, temperate forests of Asia occur primarily as hardwood forests throughout the eastern part of the continent, extending to and including virtually the entire island of Japan, except for extremes of elevation and north latitude, where there are well-developed boreal conifer forests (Aiba, ), resulting from similar climates between the two regions, primarily humid subtropical and temperate continental, Cf and Dc, respectively (Kottek et al., ). The most profound difference in climate between these regions is the existence of a monsoon season widespread in parts of Asia, arising from drastic pressure changes over the continent, that is, Monsoon Asia (Nakashizuka & Iida, ). Consequently, precipitation in Monsoon Asia has a pronounced summer maximum, with up to 90% falling between May and September. The wettest areas are on the Korean peninsula. Mean winter temperatures range from c. 3°C to -15°C in southern coastal and northern interior regions, respectively. Spring is dominated by moist tropical maritime air, with July temperatures averaging from 22°C to 28°C (Archibold, ).Soils of Asian temperate forests are analogous to those of North American temperate forests. These vary from Alfisols in upland regions to Ultisols toward the south and east, with Entisols forming from alluvium along rivers. Spodosols develop in conifer-dominated regions associated with higher elevation and more northern latitudes (Archibold, ).Although the temperate deciduous forests of Asia are the most species-rich temperate forests in the world, many of them have been altered irreparably by land use, particularly in the lowland plains, which are virtually entirely cultivated (An et al., ). Many Asian tree taxa are quite common in North America (Ying, ; Nakashizuka & Iida, ; Fang et al., ), including Quercus,Ulmus,Tilia,Fraxinus,Acer and Lindera (Henbo et al., ; Takahashi, ), and close relatives such as Asian Castanopsis and Distylium (Miura et al., ). Species vary greatly with elevation (Sang & Bai, ), with upland areas supporting species of Betula,Populus,Acer and Tilia;Salix,Betula and Populus are common in riparian areas (An et al., ). Forest type varies greatly with latitude; from north to south, this grades from mixed conifer to deciduous to mixed deciduous, then to widely distributed subtropical broadleaved evergreen forests (Liu, ).Asian conifers increase in importance with increasing elevation. Working in Chinese subalpine forests, Taylor et al.  reported extensive stands as mosaics of conifer (Abies,Larix,Sabina and Tsuga) and hardwood (Betula) patches. Other conifer genera include Picea and Pinus (Miyajima & Takahashi, ).4. Southern HemisphereBecause the distribution of land mass of the biosphere is decidedly asymmetrical, with far more land area being distributed north of the equator, temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere lack the expansiveness so characteristic of the Northern Hemisphere. These forests are confined to relatively narrow bands along western South America, southeastern Australia (including all of Tasmania) and northern New Zealand, including the northwestern half of South Island. Climatic, oceanographic and orographic factors further limit forest development in many areas of the Southern Hemisphere. These regions display very high ocean:land mass ratios; consequently, they are generally of maritime temperate climates (Cf). The Andes range exerts a profound influence on the prevailing climate of temperate-forest South America, with the windward side receiving a relatively constant flow of maritime air from the Pacific Ocean (Perakis & Hedin, ), and many are temperate rain forests (Beard, ). Mean annual temperatures are generally 6-10°C, with a range typically < 10°C. In coastal areas, July-to-January temperatures vary only by 4° or 5°C, with a similar pattern found for coastal southwestern New Zealand. Indeed, summers average c. 20°C, with winters ranging from 10-15°C. Precipitation for most of these sites is very high, exceeding 300 cm, reaching as much as 850 cm (Sturman & Tapper, ).Many of the soils throughout the temperate Southern Hemisphere are highly weathered Spodosols, the result of high amounts of rainfall and its associated fluctuating water table. These soils are generally highly acidic and infertile (Veblen et al., ; Grubb et al., ).Forest genera, and even plant families, of the temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere are quite dissimilar to those of the Northern Hemisphere. Prominent genera are Nothofagus (Nothofagaceae) and Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae), neither part of the native flora in the Northern Hemisphere. Conifer genera are in Araucariaceae (e.g. Araucaria) and Podocarpaceae (e.g. Podocarpus,Dacrydium) (Beard, ; Kershaw & Wagstaff, ). Forests of Chile and Argentina vary sensitively along the Andes-induced climatic gradient. Nothofagus species are dominant throughout these forests (Veblen et al., ; Armesto et al., ), but with Araucaria araucana replacing Nothofagus species under more stressful environmental conditions (Sanguinetti & Kitzberger, ). Mainland forests of Australia are dominated by Eucalyptus and Acacia species, especially in drier areas, whereas Nothofagus species, along with gymnosperms, are found in the cool, moist forests of Tasmania. Nothofagus is common in New Zealand, covering 84% and 40% of the South and North Islands, respectively (Beard, ). The current status of many forests of the Southern Hemisphere represents considerably altered states of the primary conditions, for example, the rainforests of Chile before the Conquest of Chile in the mid-16th Century by Spain (Smith-Ramírez, ).875IV.IV. Climate changeHumans have, indeed, long utilized temperate forests for a variety of purposes (Fig. ). Currently, temperate forests are managed worldwide for timber production, driven by an ever-increasing demand and resulting from relatively rapid growth among overstory dominant species, but also from the versatility of temperate tree species for numerous uses (e.g. paper, construction materials, furniture). Management practices potentially affect these forests across all spatial scales, from the landscape (Rhemtulla et al., ), to the overstory (Beaudet et al., ), and, often most sensitive, the herb layer (Moola & Vasseur, ; von Oheimb & Härdtle, ; Gilliam, ; Hedwall & Brunet, ). Furthermore, management practices historically often have been carried out using methods that are unsustainable in terms of maintaining forest ecosystem structure and function, including plantation forestry, especially conversion from slower-growing hardwood forests to faster-growing conifer plantations (Seidl et al., ), and forest fragmentation (Smith-Ramírez, ). Naudts et al.  suggested that broadscale conversion of temperate European hardwoods to conifer plantations contributes measurably to what is perhaps the most profound modern human influence on these forests - climate change (Lindner et al., ; Parks & Bernier, ).Thus, I suggest the following as the 'bookends' of anthropogenic impacts on temperate forests. The first is their historic - even ancient - and chronic use/conversion by ever-increasing human populations; the second is climate change. The spatial and temporal dimensions of these are superimposed (Fig. ). The legacy effects of the recent and distant past are currently on a trajectory of future dynamics operating under the overriding influence of climate change (Dale et al., ), and all that is associated with it, including altered phenology of organisms (Parmesan & Yohe, ) and extremes of weather-related phenomena (Min et al., ) (Fig. ). All responses of temperate forests to current land-use pressures must be viewed forever through the lens of climate change (Fig. ).In this final section, I emphasize challenges for future sustainability of global temperate forests. This is not meant to represent an exhaustive list of all critical issues. Rather, I emphasize those for which sufficient work has been done to provide an understanding of the nature of the problem. These include the effects of atmospheric deposition of excess N, global change-mediated alterations in phenology of temperate forest species and increases in drought/fire.1. Excess nitrogenMore pronounced in the Northern than the Southern Hemisphere, a major human perturbation of temperate forests worldwide has arisen from emissions of reactive nitrogen (Nr) into the atmosphere leading to chronically elevated deposition of Nr and a cascade of environmental stresses for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and human health (Galloway et al., ). The N comprising 78% of the atmosphere - N2 - is considered nonreactive N because it enters into essentially no photochemical transformations in the atmosphere and no metabolic pathways in organisms, other than N fixation by a small group of symbiotic and nonsymbiotic prokaryotes. However, numerous forms of Nr exist, including NH3, NH4+, NO, NO2, NO3-, 2N2O5, HNO3 and several forms of peroxyacetyl nitrates (Horii et al., ), all capable of undergoing photochemical transformations in the atmosphere and entering terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.Although more research on the effects of excess N has focused on herb-dominated than on forested ecosystems (Clark et al., ; Simkin et al., ), increasingly work is being devoted to understanding such effects on forest ecosystems, including those of the temperate regions (Sutton et al., ). Whereas current increases in N deposition are occurring on a global scale (Bobbink et al., ), N-mediated threats to biodiversity are particularly pronounced for temperate forests, especially given the spatial coincidence of high human population density - and associated N pollution - with temperate forests (Holland & Lamarque, ), the disproportionate contribution of the herbaceous layer to temperate forest diversity (Gilliam, ), and the sensitivity of the forest herb community to excess N (Gilliam, ). More vexing still is that chronically elevated N deposition is occurring contemporaneously and, indeed, interactively with climate change (Maes et al., ).Essentially all initial work on effects of excess N deposition on terrestrial ecosystems examined biogeochemical responses. These studies focused on changes in stream chemistry, generally showing increases in NO3- (from enhanced nitrification and leaching) and base cations (Ca++, Mg++ and K+) coupled with the movement of NO3- (Aber, ). Many areas of temperate forests of North America, especially those of the eastern United States, were shown to be sensitive to N saturation, a phenomenon which develops as atmospheric and microbial supply of available N exceeds biotic demand. Recent work has emphasized the effects of excess N on biodiversity of temperate forests (Thomas et al., ; Clark et al., ; Simkin et al., ). Despite considerable inter-site variability, a broad consensus is that excess N decreases forest biodiversity in temperate forests of North America.Gilliam  provided a conceptual model to describe interactive processes that are sensitive to increased N loading in ways that can lead to loss of herb layer diversity, including altering interspecific competition, increasing herbivory and pathogenic fungal infection, inhibiting mycorrhizal associations and enhancing species invasions. Nitrogen-mediated declines in biodiversity are typically seen as loss of species in the herb layer from the increased cover of fewer nitrophilic species at the expense of numerous N-efficient species (Gilliam et al., ). Fewer studies have focused on responses of tree species to N. Thomas et al.  modelled the potential effects of N on temperate forest C sequestration and tree seedling survivorship. Chronically elevated N deposition enhanced C storage, but decreased survivorship in 8 of 11 common temperate tree species. Following N saturation, C sequestration is typically limited by another nutrient (Leuzinger & Hättenschwiler, ), often phosphorus (Gress et al., ).Research focusing on chronically elevated N deposition leading to N saturation began in Europe much earlier than in North America, primarily because N-related threats appeared earlier and were far more widespread there (Gilliam, ). Although a notable amount of European work has been in the boreal region and in herb-dominated ecosystems, most recent work has been carried out in temperate forested regions, with much of that concerned with the response of the typically species-rich herbaceous layer to excess N, largely based on broad regional synthesis studies (De Schrijver et al., ; Verheyen et al., ; Dirnböck et al., ; Ferretti et al., ).Borrowing a phrase from my home state of West Virginia, where coal mining is common, many N-effects studies in Europe use the forest herb layer community as 'the canary in a coal mine' (wherein caged canaries were once placed in a coal mine, whose death served as an early indication of impending peril for coal miners from coal gas). The wide spatial extent of sampling employed by these studies adds considerable validity and credibility to their findings. Verheyen et al.  compiled data from 1205 permanent/semi-permanent sample plots among 23 carefully selected understory resurvey studies. Utilizing a wide gradient in N deposition across deciduous temperate forests in Europe, they assessed the importance of factors influencing forest herb communities, including rate of N deposition, change in density of large herbivores, and change in forest canopy cover and composition. Their results demonstrated the interactive nature of these factors, concluding that N-mediated increases in nitrophilous species can be obscured by changes in the forest overstory. Similarly, Dirnböck et al.  synthesized long-term monitoring data from 1335 permanent samples among 28 forested sites from northern Fennoscandia to southern Italy, noting temporal trends in herb-layer species cover and diversity. They found a pattern of gradual replacement of N-efficient species by nitrophilous species in response to N deposition that was consistent on the European scale. Hedwall & Brunet  attempted to separate effects of global change and altered land-use in both boreal and temperate forests of Sweden by documenting temporal variation in herb layer species over a 20-yr period in both boreal and temperate forests of Sweden, finding that most species changed in overall frequency. Comparing functional traits of both increasing and declining species, they found that current floristic dynamics were caused by combined effects of climate warming, nitrogen deposition and changing land-use (e.g. plantation forestry). Herb species' changes were more pronounced in temperate, rather than boreal, forests.Less is known regarding the effects of excess N on temperate forests of Asia (Liu et al., ) and the Southern Hemisphere. In China, this arises because of the chronically highly dissected extent of temperate forests (Liu, ) and the spatial distribution of highest amounts of N deposition occurring in tropical/sub-tropical regions (Lu et al., ). In addition to elevated rates of N emissions to the atmosphere (Liu et al., ), much of China's problems with excess N is associated with over-use of N fertilizers for summer maize agriculture (Zhang et al., ). Kim et al.  concluded that increases in N availability throughout Korea and Japan was most likely due to deposition of pollutant N from atmospheric sources from both industrial and agricultural regions. Perakis & Hedin  found that, as a result of their location relative to oceans, with prevailing winds coming off those oceans, forests of the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere receive some of the lowest annual rates of N deposition anywhere in the world (Godoy et al., ).2. Altered phenologyGiven that a prominent feature of all temperate forests is their distinct seasonality, phenology - seasonally recurring events of an organism's life cycle, for example, flowering, emergence of invertebrates, movement of migratory animals, and especially their timing and relationship with the physical environment - plays a key role in the structure and function of temperate forest ecosystems. For plants, phenological changes can be triggered by environmental cues, for example, chilling, spring temperature, growing degree days and daylight (Elmendorf et al., ). Because of their lack of thermoregulation, ectothermic animals (e.g. insects) can resemble plants with respect to environmental influences on and control of phenology, particularly temperature. Changes in phenology can affect several processes essential to survival, growth and reproduction of all organisms, especially critical when complex interspecific interactions are involved, such as plant-pollinator dynamics.Many plant species are classified phenologically, based on seasonal patterns of flowering via photoperiod. Long-day plants flower in spring as day length increases, whereas short-day plants flower from late summer into the fall as day length decreases. Actually, it is the length of uninterrupted darkness that controls flowering, such that long-day plants are more accurately short-night plants and vice versa. Despite this importance of photoperiod, thermoperiod - daily and seasonal patterns of change in temperature - also affects virtually all phenologically controlled plant processes. Anecdotally, gardeners rue days of atypically warm temperatures in late winter that allow flower and leaf buds to break dormancy, only to be followed by seasonal temperatures < 0°C that kill new, susceptible tissues.Evidence indicates that climate change has altered growing seasons in the temperate regions worldwide. Based on global meta-analyses of > 1700 wild species, including woody and herbaceous plants, birds, insects, amphibians and fish, Parmesan & Yohe  found widespread changes in phenology and species distributions attributable to climate warming. Despite some species' temporal stability, most exhibited change as predicted by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They found advancing spring events of 2.3 d/decade, and shifting biogeographical ranges toward the poles of 6.1 km per decade (Parmesan & Yohe, ), calling such changes a 'coherent fingerprint' of the overall effect of climate change on natural systems.Ibáñez et al.  observed that climate warming has altered both spring and autumn phenologies of many species, but found considerable interspecific variation and, for a given species, spatial variation in response to climate change. Forecasting future change, they used a long-term (1953-2005) dataset including spring and autumn plant phenological events (flowering/leaf out and leaf coloring/leaf fall, respectively) of tree, shrub and herbaceous species of temperate forests of South Korea and Japan, finding that most species currently exhibit advanced spring phenology and delayed autumn phenology, consistent with expectations, but also that autumn-based changes are more rapid than those associated with spring. The latter observation contrasts with comparable studies in Europe which show that spring events are changing more rapidly than autumn events (Menzel et al., ).For temperate forests, three relevant factors affecting the phenology of dominant tree species are photoperiod, degree of winter chilling and temperature (Körner & Basler, ). There is, however, interspecific variability in which predominant factor(s) control phenology among temperate forest species, with photoperiod increasing in importance with forest succession; that is, it is more important for long-lived, late-successional species than for short-lived, early-successional species. Although this may mitigate warming-induced change in temperate forest composition, Körner & Basler suggested that opportunistic (e.g. exotic invasive) species may benefit from a warming climate and claim a competitive advantage over photoperiod-sensitive species (Körner & Basler, ).Altered phenology is a driver of change not only for plant species, but also for animal species, creating a complex scenario for plant-animal interactions, particularly pollination. Less a problem for climax canopy hardwood species, which are almost exclusively wind-pollinated, this is irrelevant for temperate conifers, but an especially serious threat for forest herbaceous species. Potts et al.  reviewed patterns of global declines in numerous pollinator species, with an understandable focus on insects - especially bees - considering that they are the primary pollinators of both agricultural crops and wild species. Potential drivers of pollinator loss include habitat loss/fragmentation, agrochemicals, pathogens and introductions of novel species. Also included is climate change, and interactions among virtually all drivers. Effects of climate change on insect pollinators are seen on all hierarchical levels of organization, from the individual to population and community levels. Especially troublesome are the temporal and spatial mismatches between plant species and their insect pollinators, arising temporally from changes in phenology of plant and insect species, and spatially from altered distributions (Potts et al., ).Climate change-altered phenology has extended into changing life cycles among insects, an example of which is the mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae), native to western North America, and a generalist pest for the genus Pinus, often erupting epidemically, and killing wide swathes of trees throughout the region (Fig. a). Mitton & Ferrenberg  studied a recent epidemic of MPB that was an order of magnitude larger than ever recorded and extending to higher elevations/latitudes than on record. They demonstrated that, following 20 yr of increasing air temperatures in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the flight season of MPB began > 1 month earlier than historically known and extended twice that duration. More important was their novel finding that the life cycle of some broods of MPB increased from one to two generations per year (Fig. b). They explained that because this species lacks a diapause (suspension in development), its development is controlled solely by temperature. Accordingly, MPB populations currently respond to climate warming via faster development and expanse into previously inhospitable environments (Mitton & Ferrenberg, ). This work, however, was challenged by Bentz & Powell , who agreed that MPB is influenced by climate change, but stated that such studies need to consider thermally dependent traits that have evolved to maintain seasonality.Climate change interactions have been reported for other forest pest insects. DeRose et al.  combined empirical data, based on US Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis data, with three global change models to evaluate and predict the effect of increasing temperature on the distribution of spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis), which attacks spruce forests of North America. They predicted that extent of attack should increase with temperature, but that there should be time lag in response, given the long-lived nature of host spruce trees.This phenomenon is not confined to North America. Netherer & Schopf  reported similar findings from throughout Europe for defoliating insects, bark beetles and especially the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa), a defoliating insect for numerous conifer species. Its altitudinal and latitudinal distributions are controlled primarily by temperature and are already modified by climate change. Because of the prevailing oceanic climate in the Southern Hemisphere (i.e. generally lower temperatures during the growing season), climate change is predicted to promote contrasting effects on insect cycles there, as well (Deutsch et al., ).Related to climate change-mitigated alterations in phenology are similarly altered changes in biogeographical ranges of species. Again, Parmesan & Yohe  concluded that climate change has caused mean pole-ward range shifts of 6.1 km per decade. Using seven global circulation models (GCMs), Hansen et al.  projected future distributions of prominent temperate forest types of North America, including the eastern deciduous forest and western mountain/coastal forests of the United States, focusing on major tree species. These models differ in their type - equilibrium vs transient - and in assumptions of change in temperature and precipitation. Equilibrium models are older and simulate instantaneous increases in CO2, being run until equilibrium climate conditions are reached; the more recent transient models assume increases in glasshouse gases at 1% yr-1 until 2100, allowing climatic adjustment. Although specific predicted outcomes for eastern forest species varied among models (Fig. ), all concurred in predicting profound shifts in dominant species, especially the virtual elimination the maple-beech-birch forest type (one of the more species-rich forest types of the region) and loblolly-shortleaf pine, and expansion of oak-hickory and oak-pine types (Fig. ). Potential ranges for several subalpine coniferous species are predicted to contract in the western United States (data not shown). Among their conclusions is that changes in climate and land use in the future will be of a magnitude to cause even greater changes in biodiversity. Although distributions of some species, communities and biomes are likely to expand, others will contract, creating novel communities (Hansen et al., ).3. Drought/fireIn their now-classic paper, Hansen et al.  provided forecasts of several outcomes of global climate change using the three-dimensional model of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. These included increased atmospheric warming globally, with degree of warming dependent on growth of trace gas emissions. Another prediction, one relevant for the present and future of global temperate forests, was a notable increase in the frequency of extremes of weather events and conditions. Indeed, this prediction is well-supported by current data collected by the Munchener Ruckversicherungs-Gesellschaft, Geo Risks Research, NatCatSERVICE, wherein they examined global annual frequency of catastrophic disturbances 1980-2014 (Fig. ). All types of catastrophic disturbance, save earthquakes, have increased during this period. These are true extremes, indeed, considering that frequencies of both flooding and drought exhibit large increases over the c. 35 yr time period. Relevant to the current discussion is the increased frequency of drought, a disturbance not directly associated with any particular biome, but representing an especially serious threat to temperate forests (Fig. ).Forests typically develop in the temperate zone wherever there is sufficient precipitation to maintain soil moisture amounts capable of supporting tree growth and survival. Thus, the occurrence of extensive drought will have directly damaging effects on tree species. In addition to the direct limitations of drought-induced moisture stress, however, is the drought-induced increase in the frequency of fire. Wildfire activity has not only been predicted to increase in the future under a climate warming scenario, but also such increases are hypothesized to bring about biogeographical shifts that reduce the resilience of fire-prone forests worldwide (Harvey et al., ). Although the relative contribution of fire to forest decline is greatest in the boreal forest, fire still represents a threat to temperate forests, especially conifer forests already weakened by drought (Hansen et al., ). Harvey et al.  tested two hypotheses associated with this observation in fire-prone subalpine (largely conifer) forests in the Rocky Mountains of the United States: (1) availability of viable seeds will decrease in large patches following stand-replacing fire, and (2) seedling establishment and survival will decline measurably following post-fire drought. They found that total tree seedling establishment declined sharply post-fire with greater drought severity and with greater distance to seed source. Many responses exhibited interspecific variation, suggesting fire/drought-induced changes in forest composition. They concluded that, given the predicted increase in frequency of drought and wildfire in the future, post-fire tree seedling establishment of these forests could be reduced substantially. Although some of these reductions might be offset by compensatory increases from lower montane and upper timberline species, important near- to mid-term shifts in the composition and structure of high-elevation forests will occur under continued climate warming and increased wildfire activity.Not part of their study, yet no less important, is the interaction of drought and fire with increases in extent and severity of forests pests, as discussed in Mitton & Ferrenberg  in North America and Netherer & Schopf  in Europe. That is, the scene depicted in Fig. (a) of wide swathes of insect-killed stems is of trees more susceptible to insect death because of drought stress, and simultaneously represents substantial fuel for intense fires. Furthermore, McDowell et al.  established a close connection between climate change-enhanced drought and increases in pests for temperate forests of North America.878V.V. EpilogueRegrettably, climate change has been insinuated into the current political arena - especially in the United States, but also elsewhere around the world - wherein agenda-driven politics seek to deny its scientific reality (I remind my students that mixing politics and science is like mixing manure and ice cream - it never helps the manure, but always ruins the ice cream). In spite of this, and to a real degree because of it, climate change will continue to threaten global ecosystems in general, and temperate forests in particular, for many years in the future. It is quite compelling that, in spite of misrepresentations to the contrary, numerous long-term predictions from the past regarding climate change have largely survived scientific scrutiny. Certainly, predictions of Hansen et al.  nearly 30 yr ago have all been essentially supported, especially regarding climate change-mediated extremes of weather (Fig. ).Climate change, however, is only a part, albeit the lion's share, of global change, comprising myriad other drivers, most of which have been exposited herein. Franklin et al.  developed a conceptual model of the effects of these drivers - climate change, altered disturbance regimes, invasive species/novel species assemblages, land-use change - on terrestrial ecosystems using multiple lines of evidence. These include observations for attribution, experiments for identifying mechanisms, and use of models at multiple scales of ecological organization for verification (Fig. ). Although this model was developed as a set of general guidelines for all ecosystems of the biosphere, it seems particularly applicable to temperate forests, considering (1) the chronic alteration of these forests by human populations, and (2) their temperate nature, wherein growing/dormant seasons are an integral part of their structure and function. Such a model provides a strong base not only for ongoing scientific inquiry and understanding, but also in informing mitigation policy. Although the science to date has provided sufficient evidence providing the impetus for policy changes, there is still a clear need for further basic scientific research. Climate change is unquestionably a complex phenomenon that can be best understood only by a complex of scientific approaches, involving empirical field monitoring, manipulative field experiments and laboratory simulations, all coupled with modeling (e.g. DeRose et al., ).Finally, I suspect that I am not alone among plant ecologists in considering Sir Arthur Tansley as a professional 'hero,' a truly inspirational visionary in our field, and one who clearly articulated many ecological concepts we embrace today. Although it is an honor to write a review bearing his name, I cannot imagine that he, in his day, would have conceived the truly global scale of our 'modern' alteration of climate. Still, he deeply appreciated the profoundly negative influence human activity can have on the very ecosystems that he not only 'coined,' but on which our sustainability depends. Appropriately, I allow Sir Arthur to conclude:It would be difficult, not to say impossible, to draw a natural line between the activities of the human tribes which presumably fitted into and formed parts of 'biotic communities' and the destructive human activities of the modern world...Regarded as an exceptionally powerful biotic factor which increasingly upsets the equilibrium of preexisting ecosystems and eventually destroys them, at the same time forming new ones of very different nature, human activity finds its proper place in ecology.

The purpose of this review is to bring into focus the diverse forests of the temperate region of the biosphere, including those of hardwood, conifer and mixed dominance, with a particular emphasis on crucial challenges for the future of these forested areas. Implicit in the term 'temperate' is that the predominant climate of these forest regions has distinct cyclic, seasonal changes involving periods of growth and dormancy. The specific temporal patterns of seasonal change, however, display an impressive variability among temperate forest regions. In addition to the more apparent current anthropogenic disturbances of temperate forests, such as forest management and conversion to agriculture, human alteration of temperate forests is actually an ancient phenomenon, going as far back as 7000 yr before present (bp). As deep-seated as these past legacies are for temperate forests, all current and future perturbations, including timber harvesting, excess nitrogen deposition, altered species' phenologies, and increasing frequency of drought and fire, must be viewed through the lens of climate change.",2016,"12-01","New Phytologist (Online)","212","4","871","","https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14255","","#25030","Gilliam 2016","Laura  Dee (2024-08-23 01:43:09)(Select): New Phytologist isnt a book; Anna LoPresti (2024-07-16 08:46:33)(Screen): are we including books?;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

A review was conducted to determine the impacts of climate change on the impaired beneficial uses in the Great Lakes basin. Many climate related factors were used in this assessment including changes in: water temperature; water levels and flows; precipitation; air temperature; timing and duration of ice break up; and disturbance hazards (e.g., forest fires). Of the 14 impaired beneficial uses listed in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, 12 had a potential vulnerability to climate change. For instance, lower waters may have an impact on the areal extent and diversity of shoreline wetlands; receding shorelines could reduce spawning and nursery areas for fish; and pollution problems may be aggravated at recreational beaches, resulting in closures. Higher air temperatures could change the distribution and health of aquatic and terrestrial plant and animal species; may decrease the lake-ice season; and increase water temperatures that could enhance productivity and growth of undesirable species (e.g., algae blooms).

"475","Rocky intertidal communities: past environmental changes, present status and predictions for the next 25 years","Thompson, R C; Crowe, T P; Hawkins, S J","Rocky shores occur at the interface of the land and sea. Typically they are open ecosystems, with steep environmental gradients. Their accessibility to man has rendered them susceptible to a variety of impacts since prehistoric times. Access can be regulated, however, and they are more amenable to management than open ocean habitats. This review uses examples from throughout the world to demonstrate the extent to which rocky shores have been, and are currently, affected by pollution (examples used are endocrine disrupters, oil, eutrophication), over-collection of living resources, introduced alien species, modification of coastal processes (coastal defences, siltation) and global change (climate, sea level). These impacts are put into the context of natural fluctuations in time and variability in space of both the environment and the organisms. The relative magnitudes of some anthropogenic disturbances differ between the industrialized, developed world and the developing world. For example, in developed, industrialized countries pollution based impacts should diminish over the next 25 years due to improved regulation and a reduction in older `dirtier' heavy industry. Conversely, in many developing countries pollution will increase as a consequence of growth in the human population and industrialization. Except for large-scale disasters such as oil spills, pollution tends mainly to influence embayed coastlines. Chronic effects such as eutrophication can have broader-scale impacts over whole coastlines and elevated nutrient levels have also been implicated in a trend of increasing frequency of catastrophic kills due to harmful algal. Direct removal of living resources has had major effects on coastlines at both local and regional scales and is likely to increase over the next 25 years, especially in developing countries where rapidly expanding human populations will put further pressure on resources. Impacts from recreational activities are likely to increase with greater leisure time in wealthier regions of the world, and cheaper travel will spread these impacts to poorer regions. Invasions by alien species have increased in frequency during the last 20 years leading to some dramatic effects on native assemblages. Problems associated with alien species, especially pathogens, will continue to increase over the next few decades. The proportion of the coastline modified by artificial structures (breakwaters, seawalls, groynes) will increase because of coastal development and defences against sea-level rise and the greater frequency of storms.",2002,"06-01","Environmental Conservation","29","2","168-191","","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892902000115","","#25214","Thompson 2002","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-08-25 04:42:27)(Select): study doesn't discuss any specific transboundary flows in North America but very relevant in terms of seeing how rocky intertidal communities are responding to flows and changes due to climate change ;","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"476","Ecological impacts of invasive ecosystem engineers: A global perspective across terrestrial and aquatic systems","Rilov, Gil; João Canning‐Clode; Tamar Guy‐Haim","In both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, invasive species are a major driver of global change that is increasing in scope and impact due to the increase in global trade, habitat modification and climate change. Among invasive species, those that are known as ‘ecosystem engineers’ are considered a specific, highly influential, type of invaders, where an invader significantly alters the new environment, either physically or chemically. In this context, this perspective review discusses the different types of possible impacts of invasive ecosystems engineers (IEE) in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems.Scanning the relevant literature on the topic, we find a 12‐year lag in the use of terms relevant to the concept of ecosystem engineers in invasion‐related publications since the first publication of the concept in 1994, with a steep increase in use between 2006 and 2014. A bibliometric mapping showed a high level of connectedness between related terms and clusters, suggesting an ample flow of concepts, ideas and knowledge between realms, ecosystems and regions, and researchers that study them.Throughout this essay, we illustrate with recent examples the context‐dependency of their (positive and negative) impacts in the three realms. We review the distinction between autogenic (altering the environment for other species with their body) and allogenic (altering the environment for other species with their actions) ecosystem engineering in the context of alien species. We also put a spotlight on the well‐studied engineering effects of IEE plants and macroalgae, terrestrial and aquatic bioturbators and burrowers as well as highly effective consumers.We finalize with discussing how IEE can strongly affect ecosystem services for human wellbeing and explore the possible contribution of IEE in restoring functions and services in the face of climate change in highly invaded and fast‐warming systems like the southeastern Mediterranean Sea or areas that face frequent fires for example. We claim that the last topic has received little attention from the scientific community and should be given priority in future studies.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.",2024,"01-01","Functional Ecology","38","1","37-51","","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.14406","","#25250","Rilov 2024","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-23 06:45:45)(Select): Specific case examples of ecosystem engineers are transboundary: """"the red quinine tree, Cinchona pubescens, invaded the Galapagos Islands in the 1940s and since then spread in large areas of the highlands of Santa Cruz Island"""" (44).; ","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Relative to the evergreen species that currently dominate much of the boreal forest landscape, Larix (larch) distributions may be particularly responsive to climatic change due to their deciduous habit, and quick growth and reproduction. Here, we amassed data from 83 studies to describe and explain observed patterns of Larix range shifts under contemporary climate change.LocationNorthern hemisphere.TaxonSpecies of the genus Larix, deciduous gymnosperms.MethodsWith 181 observations of Larix range limit dynamics, we used five distribution parameters (tree line advance, stand infilling, tree line recession, stand thinning, no response) and their determinants (climate, land use change, natural disturbance) to describe and explain observed patterns of Larix range shifts under contemporary climate change. We ran a redundancy analysis on the matrix of five distribution parameters considered with other climatic and nonclimatic parameters as explanatory variables. We also characterized the climatic niche of Larix species (temperature and precipitation) and how the niche has changed during the 20th century.ResultsOf 173 sites studied over the full distribution of Larix, 63% experienced Larix population increases, 18% had population decreases, and no response was detected at 19% of sites. Latitudinal Larix tree lines in Siberia and North America appear to be infilling and shifting their distributions northward, whereas Larix recession and thinning was more common in southern regions, suggesting southern populations may be experiencing greater drought stress than their northern counterparts. Climatic niches of most Larix species shifted towards warmer and wetter conditions, with tree line advance/forest infilling in cool/dry climate space, and recession/thinning in warm/dry space.Main conclusionsNorthern expansion is underway or seems imminent for boreal Larix species, primarily L. laricina in North America. Retraction in southern regions and disappearance of some mountainous populations may be inevitable due to their narrow ecological niches. Species restricted to mountainous habitats may expand locally, though will likely not contribute to broad scale range expansion.

While existing literature extensively examines climate-induced migration, there is a lack of studies considering the compounding impacts of multiple climate hazards on migration, mobility, and immobility. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review to explore how climate-induced stressors, specifically rising temperatures, water stress and droughts, and floods and sea-level rise, have affected populations in the Global South, leading to voluntary and/or forced migration. Our findings show that these stressors have displaced and profoundly impacted millions of people, resulting in both internal and transboundary migration. Climate-induced stressors often trigger migration through indirect pathways influenced by multiple intervening institutional, political, and socio-economic factors and programmatic and policy gaps. Effectively addressing challenges related to climate-induced migration necessitates adaptation strategies that adequately consider the impacts of these intervening factors while recognizing their differential effects on various socio-demographic groups. We argue that support from Global North countries, including compensation for loss and damage, along with continued institutional and financial support from international non-governmental organizations, is crucial for managing climate-induced migration in the Global South. Without proper planning and adequate resources, migration may escalate and significantly impact human security.

"479","Climate-driven risks to the climate mitigation potential of forests","","Risks to mitigation potential of forestsMuch recent attention has focused on the potential of trees and forests to mitigate ongoing climate change by acting as sinks for carbon. Anderegg et al. review the growing evidence that forests' climate mitigation potential is increasingly at risk from a range of adversities that limit forest growth and health. These include physical factors such as drought and fire and biotic factors, including the depredations of insect herbivores and fungal pathogens. Full assessment and quantification of these risks, which themselves are influenced by climate, is key to achieving science-based policy outcomes for effective land and forest management.Science, this issue p. eaaz7005BACKGROUNDForests have considerable potential to help mitigate human-caused climate change and provide society with a broad range of cobenefits. Local, national, and international efforts have developed policies and economic incentives to protect and enhance forest carbon sinks—ranging from the Bonn Challenge to restore deforested areas to the development of forest carbon offset projects around the world. However, these policies do not always account for important ecological and climate-related risks and limits to forest stability (i.e., permanence). Widespread climate-induced forest die-off has been observed in forests globally and creates a dangerous carbon cycle feedback, both by releasing large amounts of carbon stored in forest ecosystems to the atmosphere and by reducing the size of the future forest carbon sink. Climate-driven risks may fundamentally compromise forest carbon stocks and sinks in the 21st century. Understanding and quantifying climate-driven risks to forest stability are crucial components needed to forecast the integrity of forest carbon sinks and the extent to which they can contribute toward the Paris Agreement goal to limit warming well below 2°C. Thus, rigorous scientific assessment of the risks and limitations to widespread deployment of forests as natural climate solutions is urgently needed.ADVANCESMany forest-based natural climate solutions do not yet rely on the best available scientific information and ecological tools to assess the risks to forest stability from climate-driven forest dieback caused by fire, drought, biotic agents, and other disturbances. Crucially, many of these permanence risks are projected to increase in the 21st century because of climate change, and thus estimates based on historical data will underestimate the true risks that forests face. Forest climate policy needs to fully account for the permanence risks because they could fundamentally undermine the effectiveness of forest-based climate solutions.Here, we synthesize current scientific understanding of the climate-driven risks to forests and highlight key issues for maximizing the effectiveness of forests as natural climate solutions. We lay out a roadmap for quantifying current and forecasting future risks to forest stability using recent advances in vegetation physiology, disturbance ecology, mechanistic vegetation modeling, large-scale ecological observation networks, and remote sensing. Finally, we review current efforts to use forests as natural climate solutions and discuss how these programs and policies presently consider and could more fully embrace physiological, climatic, and permanence uncertainty about the future of forest carbon stores and the terrestrial carbon sink.OUTLOOKThe scientific community agrees that forests can contribute to global efforts to mitigate human-caused climate change. The community also recognizes that using forests as natural climate solutions must not distract from rapid reductions in emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Furthermore, responsibly using forests as natural climate solutions requires rigorous quantification of risks to forest stability, forests’ carbon storage potential, cobenefits for species conservation and ecosystem services, and full climate feedbacks from albedo and other effects. Combining long-term satellite records with forest plot data can provide rigorous, spatially explicit estimates of climate change–driven stresses and disturbances that decrease productivity and increase mortality. Current vegetation models also hold substantial promise to quantify forest risks and inform forest management and policies, which currently rely predominantly on historical data.A more-holistic understanding and quantification of risks to forest stability will help policy-makers effectively use forests as natural climate solutions. Scientific advances have increased our ability to characterize risks associated with a number of biotic and abiotic factors, including risks associated with fire, drought, and biotic agent outbreaks. While the models that are used to predict disturbance risks of these types represent the cutting edge in ecology and Earth system science to date, relatively little infrastructure and few tools have been developed to interface between scientists and foresters, land managers, and policy-makers to ensure that science-based risks and opportunities are fully accounted for in policy and management contexts. To enable effective policy and management decisions, these tools must be openly accessible, transparent, modular, applicable across scales, and usable by a wide range of stakeholders. Strengthening this science-policy link is a critical next step in moving forward with leveraging forests in climate change mitigation efforts.Forests have considerable potential to help mitigate human-caused climate change and provide society with many cobenefits. However, climate-driven risks may fundamentally compromise forest carbon sinks in the 21st century. Here, we synthesize the current understanding of climate-driven risks to forest stability from fire, drought, biotic agents, and other disturbances. We review how efforts to use forests as natural climate solutions presently consider and could more fully embrace current scientific knowledge to account for these climate-driven risks.

"480","Assessing the consequences of global change for forest disturbance from herbivores and pathogens","Ayres, M P; Lombardero, MJ","Herbivores and pathogens impact the species composition, ecosystem function, and socioeconomic value of forests. Herbivores and pathogens are an integral part of forests, but sometimes produce undesirable effects and a degradation of forest resources. In the United States, a few species of forest pests routinely have significant impacts on up to 20 million ha of forest with economic costs that probably exceed $1 billion/year. Climatic change could alter patterns of disturbance from herbivores and pathogens through: (1) direct effects on the development and survival of herbivores and pathogens; (2) physiological changes in tree defenses; and (3) indirect effects from changes in the abundance of natural enemies (e.g. parasitoids of insect herbivores), mutualists (e.g. insect vectors of tree pathogens), and competitors. Because of their short life cycles, mobility, reproductive potential, and physiological sensitivity to temperature, even modest climate change will have rapid impacts on the distribution and abundance of many forest insects and pathogens. We identify 32 syndromes of biotic disturbance in North American forests that should be carefully evaluated for their responses to climate change: 15 insect herbivores, browsing mammals; 12 pathogens; 1 plant parasite; and 3 undiagnosed patterns of forest decline. It is probable that climatic effects on some herbivores and pathogens will impact on biodiversity, recreation, property value, forest industry, and even water quality. Some scenarios are beneficial (e.g. decreased snow cover may increase winter mortality of some insect pests), but many are detrimental (e.g. warming tends to accelerate insect development rate and facilitate range expansions of pests and climate change tends to produce a mismatch between mature trees and their environment, which can increase vulnerability to herbivores and pathogens). Changes in forest disturbance can produce feedback to climate through affects on water and carbon flux in forest ecosystems; one alarming scenario is that climate warming may increase insect outbreaks in boreal forests, which would tend to increase forest fires and exacerbate further climate warming by releasing carbon stores from boreal ecosystems. We suggest a list of research priorities that will allow us to refine these risk assessments and adopt forest management strategies that anticipate changes in biotic disturbance regimes and mitigate the ecological, social, and economic risks.",2000,"11-15","Science of the Total Environment","262","3","263-286","","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0048-9697(00)00528-3","","#25577","Ayres 2000","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Recently, this species has become increasingly challenged by Cronartium ribicola (white pine blister rust). This review examines literature relevant to P. strobiformis taxonomy, environmental associations, community associations, stand dynamics, and fire and disturbance ecology in order to better inform the management of this understudied species. In its US range, P. strobiformis occurs in central and southern Arizona and New Mexico and western Texas and has been documented as far north as southwestern Colorado. In Mexico, it occurs in northeastern Sonora, western Chihuahua and Durango, northern Zacatecas, southern Coahuila and central Nuevo Leon. Although P. strobiformis is a relatively high-elevation species preferring mesic habitats, it occurs across a variety of aspects, slope positions, and elevations. It rarely dominates forest composition but is most often found in complex species mixtures. While located in mixed-conifer habitats at the northern end of its range, it is associated with more diverse forest communities in the southern part of its range. Studies generally indicate P. strobiformis is a mid-seral species, although its low abundance and broad environmental amplitude complicate classification. Regeneration ecology is poorly understood, but bird and rodent seed dispersal do occur in portions of its range. Historical fire regimes in P. strobiformis mixed-conifer forests in the US were primarily characterized by frequent, low-severity surface fire, with less evidence of mixed- and high-severity fire. In Mexico, low-severity surface fire appears to have been ubiquitous within P. strobiformis habitats, with historical fire regimes still largely intact. Information is limited on the effects of disturbances other than fire. Increased temperatures and drought severity associated with climate change could potentially shrink the distribution of P. strobiformis, while altering its dominance in future forest communities.

(Guy Randall), 1960-; Weltzin, Jake F. http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n00005023","This review evaluates the effects and importance of disturbance and climate change on plant community dynamics in the United States/Mexico borderlands region. Our primary focus is on knowledge of physiognomic-level change in grasslands and woodlands of southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. Changes in vegetation physiognomy have broad implications for management and land use in the borderlands. Historically, livestock grazing and fire were the dominant disturbances in borderland ecosystems. Livestock grazing accelerates the rate of establishment and growth of woody plants (notably mesquite) in the borderlands region. However, the current role of livestock grazing in this region may be considerably less important than the historic role. Excluding livestock from grasslands now would not prevent, and may not delay, a substantial increase in woody plant abundance. In general, frequent fires are detrimental to woody plants and beneficial to Lehmann lovegrass. Although fires favor herbaceous plants at the expense of woody plants, woody plant dominance on many sites precludes the deliberate application of fire without first using chemical or mechanical treatments. Climate change is perhaps the most critical factor facing the current generation of land managers who are concerned about the future condition of borderlands ecosystems. Rising concentrations of CO₂ and other trace gases have the potential to replace grazing and fire suppression as important regulators of vegetation change. Increased atmospheric CO₂ concentrations may contribute to increased abundance of woody plants in borderlands grasslands, particularly if these increases are accompanied by shifts in seasonal precipitation or other climatic factors. Much of the knowledge garnered about borderlands plant communities is derived from descriptive research such as comparative studies and """"natural"""" experiments. This research has been valuable for documenting changes in vegetation and identifying candidate explanations for observed changes.

Diseases endemic to Canada are also likely to re-emerge. This special issue describes key infectious disease risks associated with climate change. These include emergence of tick-borne diseases in addition to Lyme disease, the possible introduction of exotic mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, more epidemics of Canada-endemic vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus, and increased incidence of foodborne illnesses.

To investigate the risks and benefits of AM, old provenance trials have been repurposed and new common-garden experiments initiated.

Using a filtered data base of 106 papers and reports, we investigate multiple aspects of this work, including subject species, tree response variables and their climatic predictors, statistical techniques, and the patterns of adaptation revealed in results. Although the reviewed work contained valuable insights into provenance-climate relationships, much of this work focused on growth in commercial conifer species and the correlation of that growth with annual or monthly climatic averages. A minority of studies investigated the effects of climate variables with direct mechanistic effects on growth or phenology, including temperature extremes, frost and drought indices, or growing-season duration. Furthermore, recent research has opened new avenues of investigation into the influence of local soil and topographic variables, and even ectomycorrhizal communities over provenance performance.

In order to fully assess the role of peatlands on global C balance, now and in the future, it is imperative that we deepen our understanding of the relative contributions of various groups of microorganisms to organic matter transformations. Here, we review the drivers structuring fungal, bacterial and archaeal communities in natural peatlands and the response of these microbial communities to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, including fire, drainage, nutrient deposition, peat mining and climate change. The microbial diversity in peatlands is characterized by organisms that have developed physiological and metabolic adaptations to cope with the constraining conditions found in these ecosystems, such as low oxygen availability, cold temperature, acidity and oligotrophy. Furthermore, these unique organisms sometimes appear to be organized as repeat mosaics responding to vegetation, physico-chemical and hydrological characteristics more than to geographical distance, in other words, similar to the much valued biodiversity aspects of the peatland vegetation itself and associated higher organisms. The response of microbial communities to disturbances is far from fully understood. In particular, whilst many studies have identified changes in microbial community composition or on microbially driven processes following a given disturbance, it remains unclear how the two components, diversity and function, relate with each other. Future challenges involve designing studies that will test whether ecological theories like species sorting, stress physiology, temporal niche or functional redundancy can be used to understand what regulates microbial populations and activity in peatlands, and studies that will allow us to predict more accurately how peatlands respond to global change or anthropogenic disturbances.",2013,"02-01","Soil biology & biochemistry","57 p.979-994","","979-994","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.10.003","","#26097","Andersen 2013","Laura  Dee (2024-08-21 06:45:52)(Included): duplicate;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

However, the extent and effects of increased SO₄²⁻ concentrations in freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems remain poorly understood regarding many aspects of ecosystem structure and functioning. Here, we review the sources of SO₄²⁻ pollution, environmental impacts on freshwater ecosystems and bioremediation opportunites and we identify key knowledge gaps and future research needs. Natural sources of dissolved SO₄²⁻ in freshwater ecosystems include mineral weathering, volcanic activity, decomposition and combustion of organic matter, oxidation of sulphides, and sea spray aerosols. Acid mine drainage, fertiliser leaching from agricultural soils, wetland drainage, agricultural and industrial wastewater runoff as well as sea level changes are the main direct and indirect sources of the anthropogenic SO₄²⁻ input to waterbodies. Increasing SO₄²⁻ concentrations in freshwater systems influence the biogeochemical processes of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Similarly, iron availability can be critical in determining the adverse effects of SO₄²⁻ on environmental receptors. The literature reviewed clearly demonstrates that SO₄²⁻ pollution may have toxic effects on aquatic plants and animal organisms, including, among others, fishes, invertebrates and amphibians, and it may also have negative implications for human health. Bioremediation systems provide opportunities to mitigate the impacts of SO₄²⁻, but removal efficiencies range widely from 0% to 70% across treatment systems such as constructed wetlands, permeable reactive barriers and bioreactors. We conclude that examination of increased SO₄²⁻ concentrations and fluxes at different spatial scales is urgently needed as the ongoing global perturbation of the S cycle is likely to be accelerated by climate change and human development activities. The adverse effects of this on freshwater organisms worldwide may prove detrimental to the future well-being of humans and ecosystems.

This trend is particularly pronounced in the context of climate change, demonstrated by the accumulation of a vast body of scholarship over multiple decades. Our work provides the first systematic review of the state of this knowledge, mapping out how phase-out is studied and employed as a policy tool for mitigating climate change. We systematically review over 400 publications, spanning three decades (1990–2021) and diverse scientific fields. Our review asks: how has scholarly work discussed phase-out as an approach to mitigate climate change, and how has this changed over time? We tackle this question from five perspectives: (a) elements targeted by phase-outs, (b) policy instruments, (c) affected industries, (d) geographic context, and (e) benefits besides climate change mitigation. Results reveal that phase-out has widely proliferated as a decarbonisation approach, developing into a bridging concept that links diverse communities of contemporary science and practice. This is reflected by engagement with manifold phase-out targets—stretching well beyond the usual suspects related to fossil fuels and end-use technologies—as well as discussion of a growing diversity of industries, policy instruments and geographies in the literature. This global proliferation of phase-outs is propelled by expectations of diverse co-benefits. Aside from gains for the environment, economy, society and health, we find widespread acknowledgment that phase-out can drive innovation and systemic change beyond the mere substitution of problematic technologies and materials. Our study also identifies several underdeveloped and underrepresented directions meriting further study. These notably include phase-out activity beyond Europe, North America and China, hard-to-abate industry sectors and non-fossil fuel targets.

Biodiversity across all levels of biological classifications is fundamentally based on genetic diversity. However, the integration of genomics and phylogenetics into conservation management may not be as rapid as climate change. The genetics of hybrid introgression as a source of novel variation for ecological divergence and evolutionary speciation (and resilience) may generate adaptive potential and diversity fast enough to respond to locally-altered environmental conditions. Major plant and herbivore hybrid zones with associated communities deserve conservation consideration. This review addresses functional genetics across multi-trophic-level interactions including """"invasive species"""" in various ecosystems as they may become disrupted in different ways by rapid climate change. """"Invasive genes"""" (into new species and populations) need to be recognized for their positive creative potential and addressed in conservation programs. """"Genetic rescue"""" via hybrid translocations may provide needed adaptive flexibility for rapid adaptation to environmental change. While concerns persist for some conservationists, this review emphasizes the positive aspects of hybrids and hybridization.

Given the rapid rate of environmental change in the Arctic, the potential ramifications on the health of marine mammals in this region are a particular concern. There are eleven endemic Arctic marine mammal species (AMMs) comprising three cetaceans, seven pinnipeds, and the polar bear (Ursus maritimus). All of these species are dependent on sea ice for survival, particularly those requiring ice for breeding. As air and water temperatures increase, additional species previously non-resident in Arctic waters are extending their ranges northward, leading to greater species overlaps and a concomitant increased risk of disease transmission. In this study, we review the literature documenting disease presence in Arctic marine mammals to understand the current causes of morbidity and mortality in these species and forecast future disease issues. Our review highlights potential pathogen occurrence in a changing Arctic environment, discussing surveillance methods for 35 specific pathogens, identifying risk factors associated with these diseases, as well as making recommendations for future monitoring for emerging pathogens. Several of the pathogens discussed have the potential to cause unusual mortality events in AMMs. Brucella, morbillivirus, influenza A virus, and Toxoplasma gondii are all of concern, particularly with the relative naivety of the immune systems of endemic Arctic species. There is a clear need for increased surveillance to understand baseline disease levels and address the gravity of the predicted impacts of climate change on marine mammal species.",2023,"01-01","Pathogens","12","7","937","","https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens12070937","","#26619","Barratclough 2023","","Biotic; Sociocultural",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

An outbreak of SNC began in coastal Oregon in the mid-1990s and has persisted since that time. Here we review the current state of knowledge after 24 years of research and monitoring, with a focus on Oregon, although the disease is significant in coastal Washington and has recently emerged in southwestern British Columbia. We present new insights into SNC distribution, landscape patterns, disease epidemiology and ecology, host-pathogen interactions, trophic and hydrologic influences, and the challenges of Douglas-fir plantation management in the presence of the disease. In Oregon, the SNC outbreak has remained geographically contained but has intensified. Finally, we consider the implications of climate change and other recently emerged foliage diseases on the future of Douglas-fir plantation management. Study Implications: Douglas-fir tree growers need to consider Swiss needle cast (SNC) and other emerging foliage diseases as SNC has not abated over the past 24 years, and along with other emerging diseases, it continues to pose a threat to Douglas-fir plantation productivity. Douglasfir management in western Oregon remains important, such that a knowledge of disease impacts and effective silvicultural responses is key. Managers should carefully consider whether alternative species may be ecologically or economically beneficial in some situations while tree improvement programs must continue to breed for tolerance to SNC. Research shows that regional scale foliage disease outbreaks can result in trophic cascades and hydrologic changes that affects more than just the trees.The environmental controls on the SNC epidemic imply that climate change could strongly influence future directions of the outbreak, with the greatest threats to trees at higher elevations.",2021,"07-01","Journal of Forestry","119","4","407-421","","https://doi.org/10.1093/jofore/fvab011","","#26712","Shaw 2021","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-27 06:20:32)(Select): Spread into CA <- transboundary;","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Data trends show global climate change effects ranging from increased oxygen consumption rates in fishes, to changes in foraging and migrational patterns in polar seas, to fish community changes in bleached tropical coral reefs. Projections of future conditions portend further impacts on the distribution and abundance of fishes associated with relatively small temperature changes. Changing fish distributions and abundances will undoubtedly affect communities of humans who harvest these stocks. Coastal-based harvesters (subsistence, commercial, recreational) may be impacted (negatively or positively) by changes in fish stocks due to climate change. Furthermore, marine protected area boundaries, low-lying island countries dependent on coastal economies, and disease incidence (in aquatic organisms and humans) are also affected by a relatively small increase in temperature and sea level. Our interpretations of evidence include many uncertainties about the future of affected fish species and their harvesters.

And, although historically the great majority of migration research has been conducted in the eastern half of the continent, there has been much recent progress on aspects of avian migration in the West. In particular, expanded use of techniques such as radar, plasma metabolites, mist-netting, count surveys, stable isotopes, genetic data, and animal tracking, coupled with an increase in multi-investigator collaborations, have all contributed to this growth of knowledge. There is increasing recognition that migration is likely the most limiting time of year for migratory birds, increasing the importance of continuing to decipher patterns of stopover ecology, identifying critical stopover habitats, and documenting migration routes in the diverse and changing landscapes of the American West. Here, we review and briefly synthesize the latest findings and advances in avian migration and consider research needs to guide future research on migration in the West.

Both controllable and uncontrollable factors for nitrate loss have been the subject of several previous studies. Due to differences in climate, biophysical dissimilarities and land management characteristics in different parts of the world the factors affecting nitrate loss are often inconsistent and hence difficult to generalize. Therefore, reanalyzing the experimental field or plot scale studies to understand the nitrate loss factors in crop fields is useful and necessary in developing management strategies for reducing nitrate loss. This research synthesized and investigated 36 peer reviewed scientific journal articles related to selected bioenergy crop fields that included: continuous corn, corn in rotation with soybean, switchgrass and Miscanthus to conduct a meta-analysis of the available research. In this study, factors such as drain tile spacing, tillage practices, type and timing of the fertilization rate, irrigation and various other factors, which are challenging to represent in regression equations, were also systematically analyzed. In addition, various other agronomic characteristics that are attributed too nitrate loss are caused by perennially planted bio energized crops such as Miscanthus and switchgrass. Results indicated that 49% of nitrate loss through surface runoff from corn fields is directly related to the annual precipitation and fertilization rate. Multiple linear regression equations were developed to estimate the annual subsurface nitrate loss for the continuous corn fields with a R2 value of 0.65, 0.58 and 0.26 for sandy loam, silty loam and clay loam, respectively. Our analysis resulted in the conclusion that corn has a 2 to 3 times higher nitrate loss in surface runoff compared to switchgrass. Likewise, continuous corn and corn in rotation with soybean contributed more than 9 times the subsurface loss of nitrate compared to the established subsurface loss attributed to the Miscanthus and switchgrass.",2017,"01-01","Agriculture","7","3","27","","https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture7030027","","#26983","Sharma 2017","","Biophysical; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"496","Impacts of climate warming on hybrid zone movement: Geographically diffuse and biologically porous aspecies bordersa","Scriber, JMark","Abstract The ecology and evolutionary biology of insect-plant associations has realized extensive attention, especially during the past 60 years. The classifications (categorical designations) of continuous variation in biodiversity, ranging from global patterns (e.g., latitudinal gradients in species richness/diversity and degree of herbivore feeding specialization) to localized insect-plant associations that span the biospectrum from polyphenisms, polymorphisms, biotypes, demes, host races, to cryptic species, remain academically contentious. Semantic and biosystematic (taxonomical) disagreements sometimes detract from more important ecological and evolutionary processes that drive diversification, the dynamics of gene flow and local extinctions. This review addresses several aspects of insect specialization, host-associated divergence and ecological (including """"hybrid"""") speciation, with special reference to the climate warming impacts on species borders of hybridizing swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae). Interspecific hybrid introgression may result in collapse of multi-species communities or increase species numbers via homoploid hybrid speciation. We may see diverging, merging, or emerging genotypes across hybrid zones, all part of the ongoing processes of evolution. Molecular analyses of genetic mosaics and genomic dynamics with """"divergence hitchhiking"""", combined with ecological, ethological and physiological studies of """"species porosity"""", have already begun to unveil some answers for some important ecological/evolutionary questions. (i) How rapidly can host-associated divergence lead to new species (and why doesn't it always do so, e.g., resulting in """"incomplete"""" speciation)? (ii) How might """"speciation genes"""" function, and how/where would we find them? (iii) Can oscillations from specialists to generalists and back to specialists help explain global diversity in herbivorous insects? (iv) How could recombinant interspecific hybridization lead to divergence and speciation? From ancient phytochemically defined angiosperm affiliations to recent and very local geographical mosaics, the Papilionidae (swallowtail butterflies) have provided a model for enhanced understanding of ecological patterns and evolutionary processes, including host-associated genetic divergence, genomic mosaics, genetic hitchhiking and sex-linked speciation genes. Apparent homoploid hybrid speciation in Papilio appears to have been catalyzed by climate warming-induced interspecific introgression of some, but not all, species diagnostic traits, reflecting strong divergent selection (discordant), especially on the Z (= X) chromosome. Reproductive isolation of these novel recombinant hybrid genotypes appears to be accomplished via a delayed post-diapause emergence or temporal isolation, and is perhaps aided by the thermal landscape. Changing thermal landscapes appear to have created (and may destroy) novel recombinant hybrid genotypes and hybrid species.",2011,"04-01","Insect Science","18","2","121-159","","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7917.2010.01367.x","","#27059","Scriber 2011","Grace Westphal (2024-08-16 03:57:42)(Select): Transboundary discussion is limited to US and Canada (mentioned only once), but the ideas in here about range limits / traits based on climates seems broadly useful; ","Biotic; Transboundary unclear; save for other sections",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"497","The Migratory Timing of Adult Summer-Run Steelhead in the Columbia River over Six Decades of Environmental Change","Robards, MD; Quinn, T P","Anadromous fishes achieve most of their lifetime growth at sea before returning to spawn in freshwater. However, populations of some species enter freshwater many months before spawning, apparently compromising growth opportunities at sea to access spawning grounds in conjunction with specific seasonal patterns of flow and temperature along the migratory route. The nutritional benefits of overwintering in the ocean may also be outweighed by a relatively dormant winter in colder river habitats. Modification of the thermal and hydrologic regimes of rivers (such as the Columbia River during the 20th century) might be expected to affect the abundance and life history patterns of such populations. This study reviews information on the migratory timing, abundance, and composition (wild versus hatchery) of summer-run (upriver) populations of steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Columbia River basin with reference to environmental changes. Despite pronounced changes in the river's environment, the late summer migration-spring spawning persists as an overall pattern as it passes Bonneville Dam (the lowest on the Columbia River). However, the historic summer run's distinct bimodality (with early and late components) has gradually become unimodal. Upriver, other complex changes have taken place in migration timing: it now occurs earlier through some reaches of the river and periods of time, reflecting both the uneven physical changes over time and the complex behavior and population structure of steelhead. We were unable, therefore, to isolate the causal mechanisms or disentangle natural from anthropogenic influences. However, our research suggests that the change in the migration pattern for summer-run steelhead reflects a response to the challenges presented by a changing environment (temperature and flow) to genetically controlled life history patterns, the relative abundance of component populations, and the relative proportion of populations derived from hatchery production (which lately [1984-1999] accounted for an average 74% of the early run and 85% of the late run).",2002,"06-01","Transactions of the American Fisheries Society","131","3","523-536","","","","#27227","Robards 2002","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-08-23 02:13:17)(Select): Columbia River runs across US-Canada border; reasonable transboundary assumption ;","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The main tracks of transmission are known; however, the relative importance of each of the components and the respective environmental risk factors are unclear. We aimed to assess and specify quantitative evidence of environmental risks of leptospirosis transmission.Methods/findingsA database of pre-selected studies, with publication dates from 1970 until 2008, was provided by an expert group. The database has been updated until 2015 using a text mining algorithm. Study selection was based on stringent quality criteria. A descriptive data analysis was performed to calculate the medians of the log transformed odds ratios. From a selection of 2723 unique publications containing information on leptospirosis, 428 papers dealing with risk factors were identified. Of these, 53 fulfilled the quality criteria, allowing us to identify trends in different geo-climatic regions. Water associated exposures were, with few exceptions, associated with an increased leptospirosis risk. In resource poor countries, floods and rainfall were of particular importance, whereas recreational water activities were more relevant in developed countries. Rodents were associated with increased leptospirosis risk, but the variation among studies was high, which might be partly explained by differences in exposure definition. Livestock contact was commonly associated with increased risk; however, several studies found no association. The median odds ratios associated with dog and cat contacts were close to unity. Sanitation and behavioural risk factors were almost always strongly associated with leptospirosis, although their impact was rarely investigated in Europe or North America.ConclusionThis review confirms the complex environmental transmission pathways of leptospirosis, as previously established.

Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and extent of community reorganization remains elusive. This is particularly true in riverine systems, which are simultaneously exposed to changing temperature and streamflow, and where land-use change continues to be a major driver of biodiversity loss. Here, we use the most comprehensive compilation of fish abundance time series to date to provide a global synthesis of climate- and LU-induced effects on riverine biota with respect to changes in species thermal and streamflow affinities. We demonstrate that fish communities are increasingly dominated by thermophilic (warm-water) and limnophilic (slow-water) species. Despite being consistent with trends in water temperature and streamflow observed over recent decades, these community changes appear largely decoupled from each other and show wide spatial variation. We further reveal a synergy among climate- and land use-related drivers, such that community thermophilization is heightened in more human-modified systems. Importantly, communities in which species experience thermal and flow regimes that approach or exceed their tolerance thresholds (high community sensitivity), as well as species-poor communities (low community resilience), also display faster rates of compositional change. This research illustrates that quantifying vulnerability of riverine systems to climate change requires a broadening from a narrower thermal focus to more integrative approaches that account for the spatially varying and multifaceted sensitivity of riverine organisms to the interactive effects of water temperature, hydrology, and other anthropogenic changes.",2021,"07-06","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","118","27","","","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011639118","","#27739","Comte 2021","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Climate change further increases outbreak risks by altering pathogen evolution and host–pathogen interactions and facilitating the emergence of new pathogenic strains. Pathogen range can shift, increasing the spread of plant diseases in new areas. In this Review, we examine how plant disease pressures are likely to change under future climate scenarios and how these changes will relate to plant productivity in natural and agricultural ecosystems. We explore current and future impacts of climate change on pathogen biogeography, disease incidence and severity, and their effects on natural ecosystems, agriculture and food production. We propose that amendment of the current conceptual framework and incorporation of eco-evolutionary theories into research could improve our mechanistic understanding and prediction of pathogen spread in future climates, to mitigate the future risk of disease outbreaks.

These risks are often related but not limited to transmissible pathogens. Mobile populations can link zones of disease emergence to low-prevalence or non-endemic areas through rapid or high-volume international movements, or both. Against this background of human movement, other global processes such as economics, trade, transportation, environment and climate change, and civil security influence the health impacts of disease emergence. Concurrently, global information systems, together with regulatory frameworks for disease surveillance and reporting, affect organizational and public awareness of events of potential public health significance. International regulations directed at disease mitigation and control have not kept pace with the growing challenges associated with the volume, speed, diversity, and disparity of modern patterns of human movement. The thesis that human population mobility is itself a major determinant of global public health is supported in this article by review of the published literature from the perspective of determinants of health (genetics/biology, behaviour, environment, and socio-economics); population-based disease prevalence differences, existing national and international health policies and regulations, and inter-regional shifts in population demographics and health outcomes. The paper highlights some of the emerging threats and risks to public health, identifies gaps in existing frameworks to manage health issues associated with migration and suggests changes in approach to population mobility, globalization, and public health.

From a review of the major pest snail and slug literature, together with our own experience, we developed a preliminary list of gastropod species displaying significant potential to damage natural ecosystems or agriculture, or human health or commerce, and either entirely absent from the United States to our knowledge or restricted to narrow areas of introduction. Comments on the list from the worldwide malacological community were then solicited and led us to modify the original list. We then evaluated the taxa on this list by ranking them according to 12 attributes--seven biological variables and five aspects of human interaction--based on thorough review of the detailed literature. The ranked list that emerged from this risk assessment process included 46 taxa (species or species-groups) in 18 families. The highest ranked taxa were in the Ampullariidae, Hygromiidae, Cochlicellidae, Helicidae, Veronicellidae, Succineidae, Achatinidae, and Planorbidae. We validated the risk assessment model by scoring a suite of non-native snail and slug species already present in the United States. The list is not definitive but rather is offered as a framework for additional research. There remain important gaps in biological knowledge of many of the taxa evaluated, and rigorous reporting of economic impacts is extremely limited.

"506","Context dependency of animal resource subsidies.","Subalusky, Amanda L; Post, David M","The transport of resource subsidies by animals has been documented across a range of species and ecosystems. Although many of these studies have shown that animal resource subsidies can have significant effects on nutrient cycling, ecosystem productivity, and food-web structure, there is a great deal of variability in the occurrence and strength of these effects. Here we propose a conceptual framework for understanding the context dependency of animal resource subsidies, and for developing and testing predictions about the effects of animal subsidies over space and time. We propose a general framework, in which abiotic characteristics and animal vector characteristics from the donor ecosystem interact to determine the quantity, quality, timing, and duration (QQTD) of an animal input. The animal input is translated through the lens of recipient ecosystem characteristics, which include both abiotic and consumer characteristics, to yield the QQTD of the subsidy. The translated subsidy influences recipient ecosystem dynamics through effects on both trophic structure and ecosystem function, which may both influence the recipient ecosystem's response to further inputs and feed back to influence the donor ecosystem. We present a review of research on animal resource subsidies across ecosystem boundaries, placed within the context of this framework, and we discuss how the QQTD of resource subsidies can influence trophic structure and ecosystem function in recipient ecosystems. We explore the importance of understanding context dependency of animal resource subsidies in increasingly altered ecosystems, in which the characteristics of both animal vectors and donor and recipient ecosystems may be changing rapidly. Finally, we make recommendations for future research on animal resource subsidies, and resource subsidies in general, that will increase our understanding and predictive capacity about their ecosystem effects.",2019,"04-01","Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society","94","2","517-538","","https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12465","","#28864","Subalusky 2019","Laura  Dee (2024-10-18 08:31:27)(Select): GREAT background for the chapter, agree not very specific to North America but the framework and types of biotic flows are relevant; Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-17 12:48:57)(Select): There is not enough specific examples to be useful for transboundary.

"507","Migrants and emerging public health issues in a globalized world: threats, risks and challenges, an evidence-based framework.","Gushulak, Bd; Weekers, J; Macpherson, Dw","International population mobility is an underlying factor in the emergence of public health threats and risks that must be managed globally. These risks are often related, but not limited, to transmissible pathogens. Mobile populations can link zones of disease emergence to lowprevalence or nonendemic areas through rapid or high-volume international movements, or both. Against this background of human movement, other global processes such as economics, trade, transportation, environment and climate change, as well as civil security influence the health impacts of disease emergence. Concurrently, global information systems, together with regulatory frameworks for disease surveillance and reporting, affect organizational and public awareness of events of potential public health significance. International regulations directed at disease mitigation and control have not kept pace with the growing challenges associated with the volume, speed, diversity, and disparity of modern patterns of human movement. The thesis that human population mobility is itself a major determinant of global public health is supported in this article by review of the published literature from the perspective of determinants of health (such as genetics/biology, behavior, environment, and socioeconomics), population-based disease prevalence differences, existing national and international health policies and regulations, as well as inter-regional shifts in population demographics and health outcomes. This paper highlights some of the emerging threats and risks to public health, identifies gaps in existing frameworks to manage health issues associated with migration, and suggests changes in approach to population mobility, globalization, and public health. The proposed integrated approach includes a broad spectrum of stakeholders ranging from individual health-care providers to policy makers and international organizations that are primarily involved in global health management, or are influenced by global health events.",2009,"01-01","Emerging health threats journal","2","","e10-e10","","https://doi.org/10.3134/ehtj.09.010","","#28951","Gushulak 2009","","Human movement; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
"508","A tale of two basins: An integrated physical and biological perspective of the deep Arctic Ocean","Bluhm, B A; Kosobokova, K N; Carmack, E C","This review paper integrates the current knowledge, based on available literature, on the physical and biological conditions of the Amerasian and Eurasian basins (AB, EB) of the deep Arctic Ocean (AO) in a comparative fashion. The present day (Holocene) AO is a mediterranean sea that is roughly half continental shelf and half basin and ridge complex. Even more recently it is roughly two thirds seasonally and one third perennially ice-covered, thus now exposing a portion of basin waters to sunlight and wind. Basin boundaries and submarine ridges steer circulation pathways in overlying waters and limit free exchange in deeper waters. The AO is made integral to the global ocean by the Northern Hemisphere Thermohaline Circulation (NHTC) which drives Pacific-origin water (PW) through Bering Strait into the Canada Basin, and counter-flowing Atlantic-origin water (AW) through Fram Strait and across the Barents Sea into the Nansen Basin. As a framework for biogeography within the AO, four basic, large-scale circulation systems (with L>1000km) are noted; these are: (1) the large scale wind-driven circulation which forces the cyclonic Trans-Polar Drift from Siberia to the Fram Strait and the anticyclonic Beaufort Gyre in the southern Canada Basin; (2) the circulation of waters that comprise the halocline complex, composed largely of waters of Pacific and Atlantic origin that are modified during passage over the Bering/Chukchi and Barents/Siberian shelves, respectively; (3) the topographically-trapped Arctic Circumpolar Boundary Current (ACBC) which carries AW cyclonically around the boundaries of the entire suite of basins, and (4) the very slow exchange of Arctic Ocean Deep Waters. Within the basin domain two basic water mass assemblies are observed, the difference between them being the absence or presence of PW sandwiched between Arctic Surface Waters (ASW) above and the AW complex below; the boundary between these domains is the Atlantic/Pacific halocline front. Both domains have vertical stratification that constrains the transfer of nutrients to the surface layer (euphotic zone), thus leading to their oligotrophic state, particularly in the more strongly stratified Pacific Arctic where, despite high nutrient values in the inflow, convective reset of surface layer nutrients by haline convection in winter is virtually absent. First and multi-year sea ice drastically alters albedo and insulates the underlying water column from extreme winter heat loss while its mechanical properties (thickness, concentration, roughness, etc.) greatly affect the efficiency of momentum transfer from the wind to the underlying water. Biologically, sea ice algal growth in the basins is proportionally almost equal to or exceeding phytoplankton production, and is a habitat and transport platform for sympagic (ice-associated) fauna. Owing to nutrient limitation due to strong stratification and light limitation due to snow and ice cover and extreme sun angle, primary production in the two basin domains is very low compared to the adjacent shelves. Severe nutrient limitation and complete euphotic zone drawdown in the AB favors small phytoplankton, a ubiquitous deep chlorophyll maximum layer, a low f-ratio of new to recycled carbon fixation, and a low energy food web. In contrast, nutrients persist –albeit in low levels– in the western EB, even in summer, suggesting light limitation, heavy grazing or both. The higher stocks of nutrients in the EB are more conducive to marginal ice blooms than in the AB. The large-scale ocean currents (NHTC and ACBC) import substantial expatriate, not locally reproducing zooplankton biomass especially from the adjoining subarctic Atlantic (primarily Calanus finmarchicus), but also from the Pacific (e.g., Pseudocalanus spp., Neocalanus spp. and Metridia pacifica). These advective inputs serve both as source of food to resident pelagic and benthic biota within the basins, and as potential grazers exerting top down control on limited phytoplankton resources. Benthic organisms within the AO basin show previously unappreciated biodiversity and surprising dispersion of species given the isolation of individual basins and low vertical carbon flux and resulting biomass. Larval dispersion is aided by the large-scale flows and perhaps, we hypothesize in the deep benthos by convective updrafts driven by geothermal heating. Zooplankton diversity, in contrast, is low, but again faunal assemblages are equally distributed between the EB and AB. Species pools of both pelagic and benthic communities change more with water depth rather than laterally, with the exception of expatriates and rare species, with close ties to today’s North Atlantic biogeographic region. Climate related change in the AO is thus manifest at significantly differing time scales. Throughout ∼90% of the Pleistocene the AO has existed in glacial mode, with narrow continental shelves, greatly restricted river inflow, thicker and perhaps immobile sea ice, and total blockage of exchange with the Pacific Ocean. During the Holocene, on shorter time scales of 1000–100years, significant changes in high latitude climate are tied to changes in temperature and perhaps moisture delivery patterns. The Arctic also experiences significant multi-decadal variability; however, the pace of change over the past three decades has been without precedent. Within the basin interior the ice is now thinner and less compact, and thus more responsive to wind stress (forcing and mixing). Concurrent with sea ice melt and increased river flow, the accumulation of fresh water and the stratification have increased, thus constraining vertical nutrient flux affecting phytoplankton size distributions, limiting primary production in parts of the basins now and likely in the future, and increasing vulnerability to acidification. In addition, sea ice is now retreating on an annual basis past the shelf break, exposing basin waters directly to sunlight and wind forcing. Thus, upwelling favorable winds (generally from east to west) can now directly and efficiently drive shelf-break upwelling, and draw nutrients from subsurface basin waters onto the shelf; at the same time upwelling favorable winds will also create onshore pressure gradients over the slope and basin which will act to slow or block the flow of waters in the ACBC, and thus alter advective pathways of both abiotic and biotic materials. Given the opening of a new ocean to multiple user groups, we expect that the central AO will play an increasing larger role both in the research and political arenas in the future, and we encourage pan-Arctic international collaboration over focus on territorial boundaries.",2015,"12-01","Progress in oceanography","139 p.89-121","","89-121","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2015.07.011","","#29150","Bluhm 2015","Matthew Schumm (2024-08-28 08:23:46)(Select): Figure 5 implies flows from waters off Canada to those off Alaska.

"509","Human adaptation to global change in rural communities of Mexico","Lutz-Ley, America N","Mexico is a global change hotspot highly integrated into international trade related to a petroleum, agro-export and tourism-based economy; human migration; and climate adaptation processes. Institutional and economic liberalization during the late twentieth century enhanced these dynamics, challenging human adaptation especially in rural settings. To date, there is a lack of systematic empirical analysis characterizing adaptation across the diverse rural communities of the country. In addressing this gap, this article reviews 50 empirical studies of adaptation in rural Mexico published between 1990 and 2019. The analysis identifies adaptive responses and contextual factors enabling or constraining adaptation at different scales and dimensions within rural social-ecological systems. Findings indicate: a) a decreasing frequency and variety of responses as they require more resources; b) an atomistic view of rural systems, excluding factors impacting adaptation, such as deagrarianization and water institutional centralization; and c) a gap in the evaluation of long-term sustainability of adaptation.",2020,"06-01","Current opinion in environmental sustainability","44 p.85-92","","85-92","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2020.08.011","","#29239","Lutz-Ley 2020","","Human movement; Sociocultural; Transboundary unclear",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

The magnitude of this challenge is reflected in recent international commitments to protect 30% of the planet by 2030 while adapting to climate change. However, because climate change is global, interventions must transcend political boundaries. Here, using the California Bight as a case study, we provide 21 biophysical guidelines for designing climate-smart transboundary marine protected area (MPA) networks and conduct analyses to inform their application. We found that future climates and marine heatwaves could decrease ecological connectivity by 50% and hinder the recovery of vulnerable species in MPAs. To buffer the impacts of climate change, MPA coverage should be expanded, focusing on protecting critical nodes for the network and climate refugia, where impacts might be less severe. For shared ecoregions, these actions require international coordination.
