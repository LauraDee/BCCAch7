"1","The ecological history of Lake Erie as recorded by the phytoplankton community","Allinger, L. E.; Reavie, E. D.","Lake Erie's water quality has fluctuated since European settlement due to cultural eutrophication and the effects of invasive species. Our attempts to understand the cause-and-effect linkages between observed ecosystem changes and various stressors are evolving. Non-indigenous species, pollutants, land-use and climate change that can alter a lake's physical and chemical environment can manifest rapid changes in community composition and abundance of phytoplankton. As such, for many decades researchers have used phytoplankton data from Lake Erie to track environmental changes. We provide a chronological account of previous and ongoing assessments of pelagic algae to summarize past and present environmental conditions of Lake Erie. This review necessarily focuses on diatom-based assessments as their preserved remains in sediments have been used to hind-cast human-induced impacts and recovery. Because of their uniqueness, this review summarizes where possible the long-term trends according to the western, central and eastern lake basins. Overall, this historical assessment summarizes a period of significant eutrophication throughout most of the 20th century, followed by water quality improvement due to nutrient reductions and establishment of filter-feeding dreissenids. Recent data suggest new issues associated with blooms of diatoms and blue-green algae. The challenges facing Lake Erie underline the need for continued monitoring and evaluation of historical records that will help us distinguish natural from anthropogenic changes, and to reveal the causes and extent of environmental insults in order to make management decisions.

"2","Large freshwater lakes: present state, trends, and future","Beeton, A. M.","The large freshwater lakes of the world are an extremely valuable resource, not only because 68% of the global liquid surface fresh water is contained in them, but because of their importance to the economies, social structure, and viability of the riparian countries. This review provides decision makers with the knowledge of large lakes (greater than or equal to500km(2)) essential to establishing policies and implementing strategies compatible with sustainable development. This is achieved by considering the present state of the lakes, the extent of changes and factors causing them, long-term consequences of these changes, major threats and possible states of the lakes into the year 2025. Case studies of lakes are presented, namely the St Lawrence Great Lakes of North America as representatives of glacial scour lakes of North America, northern Europe and Asia, and the African Great Lakes as representatives of tropical tectonic lakes. Lake Baikal is also included because it is unique for its species, great age, and largest single volume of liquid surface fresh water. The Aral Sea is further included because of the ecological disaster following diversion of water away from its basin. The major impacts on large lakes are diversions, eutrophication, invasive species, land-use change, overexploitation of resources, and pollution. These impacts can or do affect all the representative lakes, but to varying degree. The St Lawrence Great Lakes have been severely impacted by eutrophication, land-use change, overfishing, invasive species and pollution. Eutrophication has been reversed for these lakes and constraints are now in place on land use change, such as shoreline alteration and destruction of wetlands. With the demise of most commercial fishing, overfishing is no longer as important. Invasive species have become a major problem as increasingly non-indigenous species gain access to the takes. Pollution continues as a major impact. These problems are likely to continue and seriously impact use of the resources as well as bring about changes in the biota. Among the African Great Lakes, invasive species are a major problem in Lake Victoria, and eutrophication associated with land-use change and overexploitation of resources is a growing problem. Many endemic species have been lost and many are threatened, so that species associations will have changed by 2025. The Aral Sea continues to disappear and in the future, the remaining largest part of it will continue to become increasingly saline and eventually disappear. A small body of water will remain as a freshwater lake with a productive, although small, fishery. Lake Baikal shows evidence of pollution in the southern basin and is likely to be impacted by land-use changes, primarily logging. Some non-indigenous species are present, but so far, they are not a major problem. Overexploitation of resources in the watershed could lead to adverse impacts on inshore waters. Overfishing has been recognized and appears under control. The major threat to Baikal is continued and growing pollution. Climate change and pollution are global problems that will affect all lakes, large and small. At present, while some warming has occurred, climate change appears not to have impacted large lakes. Present studies on the Laurentian Great Lakes predict possible major impacts. Pollution, especially from persistent toxic substances such as PCBs, is a global problem. Diversion of water out or away from large lakes will become more of a threat as global human population growth continues and water supplies from rivers and ground water become depleted.",2002,"MAR","Environmental Conservation","29","1","21-38","WOS:000175924000003","10.1017/S0376892902000036","","#997","Beeton 2002","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-06 09:09:57)(Select): This is an old review and references 2025 as the future for future climate change impacts (next year!).

"3","The Decline and Impending Collapse of the Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) Population in the North Atlantic Ocean: A Review of Possible Causes","Dadswell, M.; Spares, A.; Reader, J.; McLean, M.; McDermott, T.; Samways, K.; Lilly, J.","Adult returns to many Atlantic salmon wild and hatchery stocks of the North Atlantic have declined or collapsed since 1985. Enhancement, commercial fishery closures, and angling restrictions have failed to halt the decline. Human impacts such as dams, pollution or marine overexploitation were responsible for some stock declines in the past, but adult returns to river and hatchery stocks with no obvious local impacts have also declined or collapsed since 1985. Multiple studies have postulated that the recent widespread occurrence of low adult returns may be caused by climate change, salmon farming, food availability at sea, or marine predators but these possibilities are unsupported by stocks that persist near historic levels, loss of stocks remote from farm sites, a diverse marine prey field, and scarcity of large offshore predators. The decline and collapse of stocks has common characteristics: 1) cyclic annual adult returns cease, 2) annual adult returns flatline, 3) adult mean size declines, and 4) stock collapses occurred earliest among watersheds distant from the North Atlantic Sub-polar Gyre (NASpG). Cyclic annual adult returns were common to all stocks in the past that were not impacted by anthropogenic changes to their natal streams. A flatline of adult abundance and reduction in adult mean size are common characteristics of many overexploited fish stocks and suggest illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fisheries exploitation at sea. Distance from the NASpG causing higher mortality of migrating post-smolts would increase the potential for collapse of these stocks from IUU exploitation. By-catch of post-smolts and adults in paired-trawl fisheries off Europe and intercept adult fisheries off Greenland, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and off Europe have been sources of marine mortality but seem unlikely to be the primary cause of the decline. Distribution in time and space of former, legal high-sea fisheries indicated fishers were well acquainted with the ocean migratory pattern of salmon and combined with lack of surveillance since 1985 outside Exclusive Economic Zones or in remote northern regions may mean high at-sea mortality occurs because of IUU fisheries. The problem of IUU ocean fisheries is acute, has collapsed numerous stocks of desired species worldwide, and is probably linked to the decline and impending collapse of the North Atlantic salmon population.",2022,"MAR 16","REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE & AQUACULTURE","30","2","215-258","WOS:000668774600001","10.1080/23308249.2021.1937044","","#2660","Dadswell 2022","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-30 12:40:25)(Select): Review paper indicates that climate change is not responsible for collapse of salmon fisheries """"In our opinion climate change

"4","Consequences of Shifts in Abundance and Distribution of American Chestnut for Restoration of a Foundation Forest Tree","Dalgleish, H. J.; Nelson, C. D.; Scrivani, J. A.; Jacobs, D. F.","Restoration of foundation species, such as the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) that was devastated by an introduced fungus, can restore ecosystem function. Understanding both the current distribution as well as biogeographic patterns is important for restoration planning. We used United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data to quantify the current density and distribution of C. dentata. We then review the literature concerning biogeographic patterns in C. dentata. Currently, 431 +/- 30.2 million stems remain. The vast majority (360 +/- 22 million) are sprouts <2.5 cm dbh. Although this number is approximately 10% of the estimated pre-blight population, blight has caused a major shift in the size structure. The current-day population has a larger range, particularly west and north, likely due to human translocation. While climate change could facilitate northward expansion, limited seed reproduction makes this unlikely without assisted migration. Previous research demonstrates that the current, smaller population contains slightly higher genetic diversity than expected, although little information exists on biogeographic patterns in the genetics of adaptive traits. Our research provides a baseline characterization of the contemporary population of C. dentata, to enable monitoring stem densities and range limits to support restoration efforts.",2016,"JAN","Forests","7","1","","WOS:000369493400009","10.3390/f7010004","","#2684","Dalgleish 2016","Anabel Kinsey (2024-11-24 05:05:33)(Select): Figure 1 shows expansion into Ontario, definitely transboundary ; ","Biotic; Intervention; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

M.; Shook, K.; Demuth, M. N.; Pietroniro, A.","The interior of western Canada, like many similar cold mid- to high-latitude regions worldwide, is undergoing extensive and rapid climate and environmental change, which may accelerate in the coming decades. Understanding and predicting changes in coupled climate-land-hydrological systems are crucial to society yet limited by lack of understanding of changes in cold-region process responses and interactions, along with their representation in most current-generation land-surface and hydrological models. It is essential to consider the underlying processes and base predictive models on the proper physics, especially under conditions of non-stationarity where the past is no longer a reliable guide to the future and system trajectories can be unexpected. These challenges were forefront in the recently completed Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN), which assembled and focused a wide range of multi-disciplinary expertise to improve the understanding, diagnosis, and prediction of change over the cold interior of western Canada. CCRN advanced knowledge of fundamental cold-region ecological and hydrological processes through observation and experimentation across a network of highly instrumented research basins and other sites. Significant efforts were made to improve the functionality and process representation, based on this improved understanding, within the fine-scale Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform and the large-scale Modelisation Environmentale Communautaire (MEC) - Surface and Hydrology (MESH) model. These models were, and continue to be, applied under past and projected future climates and under current and expected future land and vegetation cover configurations to diagnose historical change and predict possible future hydrological responses. This second of two articles synthesizes the nature and understanding of cold-region processes and Earth system responses to future climate, as advanced by CCRN. These include changing precipitation and moisture feedbacks to the atmosphere; altered snow regimes, changing balance of snowfall and rainfall, and glacier loss; vegetation responses to climate and the loss of ecosystem resilience to wildfire and disturbance; thawing permafrost and its influence on landscapes and hydrology; groundwater storage and cycling and its connections to surface water; and stream and river discharge as influenced by the various drivers of hydrological change. Collective insights, expert elicitation, and model application are used to provide a synthesis of this change over the CCRN region for the late 21st century.",2021,"APR 9","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","25","4","1849-1882","WOS:000639027600002","10.5194/hess-25-1849-2021","","#2886","DeBeer 2021","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-02 06:10:48)(Select): The maps show parts of the U.S., and the ecosystems being discussed certainly overlap at the border, but I could not find any mention of transboundary flows that specifically cross US/Canada borders.

"6","Arctic kelp forests: Diversity, resilience and future","Filbee-Dexter, K.; Wernberg, T.; Fredriksen, S.; Norderhaug, K. M.; Pedersen, M. F.","The Arctic is one of the most rapidly changing places on Earth and it is a sentinel region for understanding the range and magnitude of planetary changes, and their impacts on ecosystems. However, our understanding of arctic coastal ecosystems remains limited, and the impacts of ongoing and future climate change on them are largely unexplored. Kelp forests are the dominant habitat along many rocky Arctic coastlines, providing structure and food for economically and ecologically important species. Here we synthesize existing information on the distribution and diversity of arctic kelp forests and assess how ongoing changes in environmental conditions could impact the extent, productivity, and resilience of these important ecosystems. We identify regions where the range and growth of arctic kelp are likely to undergo rapid short-term increase due to reduced sea ice cover, increased light, and warming. However, we also describe areas where kelps could be negatively impacted by rising freshwater input and coastal erosion due to receding sea ice and melting permafrost. In some regions, arctic kelp forests have undergone sudden regime shifts due to altered ecological interactions or changing environmental conditions. Key knowledge gaps for arctic kelp forests include measures of extent and diversity of kelp communities (especially northern Canada and northeastern Russia), the faunal communities supported by many of these habitats, and the role of arctic kelp forests in structuring nearby pelagic and benthic food webs. Filling in these gaps and strategically prioritizing research in areas of rapid environmental change will enable more effective management of these important habitats, and better predictions of future changes in the coastal ecosystems they support and the services that they provide.",2019,"JAN","Global and Planetary Change","172","","1-14","WOS:000456222800001","10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.09.005","","#3749","Filbee-Dexter 2019","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-12 09:59:28)(Select): There is a paragraph towards the end on expected northward shifts in kelp species with climate change, so potential flow = kelp.

Disturbances in the ABZ span a wide gradient of spatiotemporal scales and have varying impacts on ecosystem properties and function. However, many ABZ disturbances are relatively understudied and have different sensitivities to climate and trajectories of recovery, resulting in considerable uncertainty in the impacts of climate warming and human land use on ABZ vegetation dynamics and in the interactions between disturbance types.

R.; Greenwood, G.; Mark, B. G.; Milner, A. M.; Weingartner, R.; Winder, M.","The cryosphere in mountain regions is rapidly declining, a trend that is expected to accelerate over the next several decades due to anthropogenic climate change. A cascade of effects will result, extending from mountains to lowlands with associated impacts on human livelihood, economy, and ecosystems. With rising air temperatures and increased radiative forcing, glaciers will become smaller and, in some cases, disappear, the area of frozen ground will diminish, the ratio of snow to rainfall will decrease, and the timing and magnitude of both maximum and minimum streamflow will change. These changes will affect erosion rates, sediment, and nutrient flux, and the biogeochemistry of rivers and proglacial lakes, all of which influence water quality, aquatic habitat, and biotic communities. Changes in the length of the growing season will allow low-elevation plants and animals to expand their ranges upward. Slope failures due to thawing alpine permafrost, and outburst floods from glacier-and moraine-dammed lakes will threaten downstream populations.Societies even well beyond the mountains depend on meltwater from glaciers and snow for drinking water supplies, irrigation, mining, hydropower, agriculture, and recreation.

"9","Effects of climate change on four New England groundfish species","Klein, E. S.; Smith, S. L.; Kritzer, J. P.","Multiple groundfish stocks in New England remain depleted despite management measures that have been effective elsewhere. A growing body of research suggests that environmental change driven by increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and ocean is unfolding more rapidly in New England than elsewhere, and is an important factor in the failure of these stocks to respond to management. We reviewed research on effects of changes in temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and ocean currents on pelagic life stages, post-settlement life stages, and reproduction of four species in the New England groundfish fishery: Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), and yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea). The volume of research on cod was nearly equal to that on the other three species combined. Similarly, many more studies examined effects of temperature than other factors. The majority of studies suggest adverse outcomes, with less evidence for mixed or positive effects. However, for all of the factors other than temperature, there are more knowledge gaps than known effects. Importantly, most work to date examines impacts in isolation, but effects might combine in nonlinear ways and cause stronger reductions in stock productivity than expected. Management strategies will need to account for known effects, nonlinear interactions, and uncertainties if fisheries in New England are to adapt to environmental change.",2017,"JUN","Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries","27","2","317-338","WOS:000403533200003","10.1007/s11160-016-9444-z","","#6308","Klein 2017","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood. Goals: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health. Methods: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention. Environmental Findings: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources - coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths. Ecosystem Findings: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks. Human Health Findings: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children's risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals - phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste - can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South - environmental injustice on a planetary scale. Conclusions: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth's resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted. Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored. Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries. Recommendations: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health. Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress. Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries. Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.",2020,"","ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH","86","1","","WOS:000595376400001","10.5334/aogh.2831","","#6701","Landrigan 2020","Elliott Parsons (2024-10-31 12:53:02)(Select): paper is a review, looks at intersection of ocean pollution and climate change - flows include ocean water (gyres), and air (distributing air pollution).

This critical period is a crisis for biodiversity, but the perturbations caused by global environmental change also offer new opportunities to study the evolution of species boundaries-their persistence, formation, or collapse-over rapid evolutionary timescales. Increasing temperature means and fluctuations have the potential to alter gene flow between species through changes in species distributions, interactions, life history, and temperature-dependent behavior.

G.; Hinch, S. G.; Cooke, S. J.; Patterson, D. A.","Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) is one of the most iconic and valued species of Pacific salmon. Various studies have examined the potential effects of future climate change on sockeye salmon, but there is currently no synthesis of the documented effects of climate on this species. In this paper, we present a synthesis of 80 peer-reviewed publications in the English language evaluating the effects of climate on sockeye salmon growth, phenology, and survival. The great majority of studies examined have been conducted with stocks from North America (90 % of studies). Survival (55 %) has been the most frequently studied aspect of the sockeye salmon life history in relation to climate, followed by growth (45 %) and phenology (30 %), with temperature (83.4 %) being the climate-related variable most frequently examined in such studies. Across life stages, the effects of climate-related variables have been most frequently studied on fry (36.3 %) and least studied on spawners (7.5 %). Our synthesis revealed that associations between temperature and growth, phenology, or survival have been uncovered for all the life stages of sockeye salmon, whereas relationships with other climate-related variables have been sparse. There is substantial evidence that sockeye salmon are influenced by thermal conditions experienced at regional, rather than ocean- or continental-wide scales, and that responses to temperature vary among and within stocks. The mechanisms by which climate affect sockeye salmon during the early stages in freshwater and while at sea are still poorly understood and warrant future research. More research on the effects of non-temperature, climate-related variables (e.g. stream flow, ocean pH), inter-generational and carry-over effects of climate, interaction between climate and non-climate stressors, and adaptation to climate change are also needed. Such information will be critical to advance our understanding of how sockeye salmon stocks will fare with future climate change.",2012,"DEC","Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries","22","4","887-914","WOS:000311500300003","10.1007/s11160-012-9271-9","","#7849","Martins 2012","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-15 15:38:55)(Select): Unclear what the climate change impacts are to flows that are transboundary - ;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

T.","One of the most pronounced effects of climate change on the world's oceans is the (generally) poleward movement of species and fishery stocks in response to increasing water temperatures. In some regions, such redistributions are already causing dramatic shifts in marine socioecological systems, profoundly altering ecosystem structure and function, challenging domestic and international fisheries, and impacting on human communities. Such effects are expected to become increasingly widespread as waters continue to warm and species ranges continue to shift. Actions taken over the coming decade (2021-2030) can help us adapt to species redistributions and minimise negative impacts on ecosystems and human communities, achieving a more sustainable future in the face of ecosystem change. We describe key drivers related to climate-driven species redistributions that are likely to have a high impact and influence on whether a sustainable future is achievable by 2030. We posit two different futures-a 'business as usual' future and a technically achievable and more sustainable future, aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals. We then identify concrete actions that provide a pathway towards the more sustainable 2030 and that acknowledge and include Indigenous perspectives. Achieving this sustainable future will depend on improved monitoring and detection, and on adaptive, cooperative management to proactively respond to the challenge of species redistribution.

The decline of amphibian populations as a result of the effect of this pathogen occurred simultaneously in various parts of the world from the early 1980's. In Mexico the epidemic wave of Bd was identified in the 1970's, which is consistent with the decline of salamander (caudate) populations in the southern part of the country. Our work presents a review of the state of knowledge of chytridiomycosis as a factor in the decline of amphibian populations worldwide and the information gathered until now of the presence of this pathogen in Mexico. To date, there has been infection in 50 Mexican amphibian species that are mainly distributed in the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico, and was determined that the families Hylidae and Plethodontidae are the most affected. Several authors have suggested that global climate change has played a key role in the occurrence and virulence of Batrachochytrium because the temperature increase induces an imbalance in the pathogen-host relationship to increased virulence of Bd and / or increased susceptibility to infection in amphibians. On this matter, we analyzed the reported temperatures of 1964-1989 in areas where the decline of caudates was more drastic. We found no relationship between the decline of salamanders with temperature.

Intervening in the cyclone hazard itself has the potential to prevent deaths and destruction, and reduce the costs of disaster recovery. We provide a technical review of these interventions. This unifies an otherwise sparse and disconnected literature, providing a starting point for further discussion by academics and policymakers. Potential interventions include cloud seeding, using pipes to inject cool water into cyclone hotspots, injecting particles into the upper atmosphere and atmospheric aerosol injections. Approaches have different logistical requirements, side effects and promise. Understanding the effectiveness and associated risks of different interventions will inform prudent cyclone risk management and research. Our review points to the promise of aerosol injection and high-altitude particle injection as first research directions. We also discuss potential governance risks and requirements of cyclone interventions. Cyclone interventions raise many issues, ranging from robust monitoring of ecological side effects, to geopolitics and politicisation.

Microparasites selected for enhanced virulence in culture settings should be less successful maintaining infectivity in wild populations, as once the host dies, there are limited opportunities to infect new individuals. Instead, moderately virulent microparasites persisting for long periods across multiple environments are of greatest concern. Evolved resistance to endemic microparasites may reduce susceptibilities, but as barriers to microparasite distributions are weakened, and environments become more stressful, unexposed populations may be impacted and pathogenicity enhanced. We provide an overview of the evolutionary and ecological impacts of infectious diseases in wild salmon and suggest ways in which modern technologies can elucidate the microparasites of greatest potential import. We present four case studies that resolve microparasite impacts on adult salmon migration success, impact of river warming on microparasite replication, and infection status on susceptibility to predation. Future health of wild salmon must be considered in a holistic context that includes the cumulative or synergistic impacts of multiple stressors.

G.; Massa, M. L.; Cohen, E. B.","Birds must contend with an array of anthropogenic threats during their migratory journeys. Many migrants are killed due to encounters with artificial light, introduced species, pollutants, and other anthropogenic hazards, while survivors of these encounters can suffer longer-lasting negative effects. The nonlethal effects of anthropogenic threats on migrating birds are less well understood than direct mortality, yet both potentially contribute to population declines. For example, building collisions frequently kill migrating birds, but the numbers of migrants that survive with an impaired ability to fly, refuel, or navigate to their destination on time is not well understood. Though not immediately fatal, such injuries can lead to delayed mortality and, ultimately, reduced lifetime reproductive success. Furthermore, migrants are likely to encounter multiple threats on their journeys, which can interact synergistically to further reduce fitness. For instance, light pollution attracts and disorients migrants, increasing the likelihood of window strikes, and surviving birds may be more vulnerable to predation from introduced predators. While considerable attention has focused on the lethal effects of anthropogenic threats, here, we review nonlethal effects of eight types of threats during migration, their interactions, and the pathways through which they can exert fitness costs. In doing so, we identify knowledge gaps and suggest areas for future research. In the absence of more information, we propose that the greatest reduction in the cumulative lethal and nonlethal impacts of anthropogenic hazards will be achieved by addressing threat types, like artificial light at night, that interact with and compound the impact of additional threats. Direct mortality from anthropogenic sources is recognized as a key driver of population declines, but a full understanding of the impacts of human activity on migrating birds must include the cumulative and interacting effects that extend beyond immediate mortality en route to influence overall migration success and lifetime fitness. Lay Summary & BULL; Migrating birds around the world face a wide variety of threats from human activity and many species are declining significantly. & BULL; Many migrants are killed by these threats, while those exposed but not immediately killed may experience changes in their condition, migration timing, orientation, or route. & BULL; Nonlethal effects of threats during migration, such as sensory pollutants and introduced species, have not been well-studied but are likely contributing to population declines by lowering future survival or reproduction. & BULL; We review support for the nonlethal impacts of eight anthropogenic threats, describe how they can cause nonlethal fitness costs for migrating birds, and identify knowledge gaps. & BULL; Reducing threats that compound the impacts of other threats, such as artificial light at night, will help to minimize the cumulative impacts on migratory birds. & BULL; Fully capturing the costs of human activity on migratory birds requires understanding both lethal and nonlethal impacts of encounters with anthropogenic threats during migration.",2023,"AUG 11","ORNITHOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","125","3","","WOS:001027469400001","10.1093/ornithapp/duad020","","#8801","Nemes 2023","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-11-22 07:04:41)(Select): study does not specifically focus on North America but could be relevant for understanding global climate change impacts on migratory bird populations ;","Biotic; Potentially relevant; Transboundary unclear; save for other sections",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE

Global mean temperature could increase by 1.5-4.5 degrees C or more over historic levels, and extreme weather eventsdrought, storms, and floodingare likely to increase greatly in frequency. Although ecologists and foresters agree that the practice of forestry will be transformed under climate change, these uncertainties compound the challenge of achieving sustainable, adaptive forest management. In this aritcle, we (i) present a multidisciplinary synthesis of current knowledge of responses of temperate and boreal tree species and forest communities to climate change, and (ii) outline silvicultural strategies for adapting temperate and boreal forests to confront climate change. Our knowledge synthesis proceeds through critical appraisals of efforts to model future tree distributions and responses to climate change, and reviews physiological, phenological, acclimation, and epigenetic responses to climate. As is the case of climate change itself, there are numerous uncertainties about tree species and provenance responses to climate change. For example, acclimation of respiration and epigenetic conditioning of seed embryos has the potential to buffer species against limited warming. Provenances within species also display idiosyncratic responses to altered climates, implying that soemm varieties will be more resilient or resistant to climate change than others. Genetically determined limits to climatic tolerance, and the limits of tree community resistance and resilience (speed of recovery from disturbance) in the face of climate-related disturbances are largely unknown. These unknowns require managers to adopt a portfolio of silvicultural strategies, which may range from minor modifications of current practices to design of novel multi-species stands that may have no historical analogue. Forest managers must be prepared to respond nimbly as they develop, incorporate new insights about climate change and species responses to warming into their practices.

T.","Model systems in biology expand the research capacity of individuals and the community. Closely related to Arabidopsis, the genus Boechera has emerged as an important ecological model owing to the ability to integrate across molecular, functional, and eco-evolutionary approaches. Boechera species are broadly distributed in relatively undisturbed habitats predominantly in western North America and provide one of the few experimental systems for identification of ecologically important genes through genome-wide association studies and investigations of selection with plants in their native habitats. The ecologically, evolutionarily, and agriculturally important trait of apomixis (asexual reproduction via seeds) is common in the genus, and field experiments suggest that abiotic and biotic environments shape the evolution of sex. To date, population genetic studies have focused on the widespread species B. stricta, detailing population divergence and demographic history. Molecular and ecological studies show that balancing selection maintains genetic variation in similar to 10% of the genome, and ecological trade-offs contribute to complex trait variation for herbivore resistance, flowering phenology, and drought tolerance. Microbiome analyses have shown that host genotypes influence leaf and root microbiome composition, and the soil microbiome influences flowering phenology and natural selection. Furthermore, Boechera offers numerous opportunities for investigating biological responses to global change. In B. stricta, climate change has induced a shift of >2 weeks in the timing of first flowering since the 1970s, altered patterns of natural selection, generated maladaptation in previously locally-adapted populations, and disrupted life history trade-offs.

Halibut collapsed under high exploitation in the mid-19th century, but the Canadian fisheries value has increased seven-fold since the early 2000s. Atlantic halibut's thermal habitat has increased due to warming, possibly contributing to its expansion. Genomic evidence differentiates two populations in the four management units, whereas there is non-genetic spatial structure within each of the stock boundaries. There are different core juvenile areas and a diversity of spawning migration patterns influenced by timing, fish size, maturity state, and distance between summer-feeding and over-wintering habitats. From tagging studies, multiple estimates of median distance at recapture (similar to 3-90 km) are much less than the spatial domain of each stock. Growth rates are faster in the warmer south, as predicted by growing degree day.

Empirical data on the impact of climate change on bats are a cause for concern as current increases in global temperature are one fifth, or less, of those expected over the next century. We review observed impacts of climate change on bats and identify risk factors allowing species-specific predictions. The impact on species is reviewed in relation to six aspects, namely foraging, roosting, reproduction, biogeography, extreme weather events and indirect effects of climate change. For some aspects of species' ecology, there are insufficient data available to make accurate assessment of impacts. We identify seven risk factors encompassing three broad aspects: biogeography - small range size, high latitude or high altitude range and a range occupying a geographic area likely to become water stressed; foraging niche - frugivory and species restricted to aerial hawking; dispersal ability - species with restricted dispersal behaviour. We use the European and north-west African bats as a case study to assess the relative risk of climate change to individual species.

In particular, IAS are predicted to experience widespread changes in distribution in response to climate change, with many expanding their ranges into new areas. However, the two drivers of global change are seldom considered together in policy and management. We conducted a knowledge synthesis to assess the state of research on IAS range shifts under climate change in Canada. We found that the study of IAS distribution changes caused by climate change is a relatively new field of inquiry that integrates research in the areas of ecology, conservation biology, and environmental sciences. The multidisciplinary dimensions of the issue are largely overlooked in the scholarly literature, with most studies having a purely natural science perspective. Very little original research has occurred in the field to date; instead literature reviews are common. Research focuses on modeling range changes of current IAS threats, rather than predicting potential future IAS threats. The most commonly studied IAS already occur in Canada as native species that have spread beyond their range (e. g., lyme disease, mountain pine beetle, smallmouth bass) or as established invaders (e. g., gypsy moth). All of these IAS are expected to expand northward with climate change, resulting in widespread negative impacts on forest and freshwater biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and public health. Many barriers to predicting IAS range change under climate change are identified in the literature, including the complexity of the issue, lack of ecological data, and failure to integrate climate change - IAS interactions into research, policy, and management.

We primarily consider the ecological and physical resilience of aquaculture in the Gulf of Maine (GoM), where a thriving industry includes marine algae, extensive and intensive shellfish aquaculture, and a well-established Atlantic salmon industry, as well as the infrastructure required to support these economically important ventures. The historical record of sea surface temperature in the GoM, estimated from gridded, interpolated in situ measurements, shows considerable interannual and decade-scale variability superimposed on an overall warming trend. Climate model projections of sea surface temperature indicate that the surface waters in the GoM could warm 0.5-3.5 degrees C beyond recent values by the year 2100. This suggests that, while variability will continue, anomalous warmth of marine heatwaves that have been observed in the past decade could become the norm in the GoM ca. 2050, but with the most significant impacts to existing aquaculture along the southernmost region of the coast. We consider adaptations leading to aquacultural resilience despite the effects of warming, larger numbers of harmful nonindigenous species (including pathogens and parasites), acidification, sea-level rise, and more frequent storms and storm surges.

A.; Lane, R.; Sharp, L. A.","This review synthesizes the knowledge regarding the environmental forces affecting water level variability in the coastal waters of the Mississippi River delta and relates these fluctuations to planned river diversions. Water level fluctuations vary significantly across temporal and spatial scales, and are subject to influences from river flow, tides, vegetation, atmospheric forcing, climate change, and anthropogenic activities. Human impacts have strongly affected water level variability in the Mississippi River delta and other deltas worldwide. Collectively, the research reviewed in this article is important for enhancing environmental, economic, and social resilience and sustainability by assessing, mitigating, and adapting to geophysical changes that will cascade to societal systems in the coming decades in the economically and environmentally important Mississippi River delta. Specifically, this information provides a context within which to evaluate the impacts of diversions on the hydrology of the Mississippi delta and creates a benchmark for the evaluation of the impact of water level fluctuations on coastal restoration projects worldwide.",2019,"","Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","224","","117-137","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.04.020","","#19154","Hiatt 2019","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-06 07:39:55)(Select): This paper mostly focuses on the Mississippi River delta, but Gulf of Mexico is mentioned multiple times (which of course borders other countries).

"28","The integration of climate change, spatial dynamics, and habitat fragmentation: a conceptual overview","Holyoak, M.; Heath, S. K.","A growing number of studies have looked at how climate change alters the effects of habitat fragmentation and degradation on both single and multiple species; some raise concern that biodiversity loss and its effects will be exacerbated. The published literature on spatial dynamics (such as dispersal and metapopulation dynamics), habitat fragmentation and climate change requires synthesis and a conceptual framework to simplify thinking. We propose a framework that integrates how climate change affects spatial population dynamics and the effects of habitat fragmentation in terms of: (i) habitat quality, quantity and distribution; (ii) habitat connectivity; and (iii) the dynamics of habitat itself. We use the framework to categorize existing autecological studies and investigate how each is affected by anthropogenic climate change. It is clear that a changing climate produces changes in the geographic distribution of climatic conditions, and the amount and quality of habitat. The most thorough published studies show how such changes impact metapopulation persistence, source-sink dynamics, changes in species' geographic range and community composition. Climate-related changes in movement behavior and quantity, quality and distribution of habitat have also produced empirical changes in habitat connectivity for some species. An underexplored area is how habitat dynamics that are driven by climatic processes will affect species that live in dynamic habitats. We end our discussion by suggesting ways to improve current attempts to integrate climate change, spatial population dynamics and habitat fragmentation effects, and suggest distinct areas of study that might provide opportunities for more fully integrative work.",2016,"","Integrative Zoology","11","1","40-59","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1749-4877.12167","","#19228","Holyoak 2016","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-11-28 04:06:40)(Select): doesn't have a huge specific focus on North America but transboundary flows in North America are mentioned and I think it's relevant enough to the study to be included ;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

The millions of prairie-pothole wetlands scattered across the Prairie Pothole Region (hereafter PPR) provide critical ecosystem functions at local, regional, and continental scales. However, an estimated loss of 50% of historical wetlands and the widespread conversion of grasslands to cropland make the PPR a heavily modified landscape. Therefore, it is essential to understand the current and potential future stressors affecting prairie-pothole wetland ecosystems in order to conserve and restore their functions. Here, we describe a conceptual model that illustrates how (a) historical wetland losses, (b) anthropogenic landscape modifications, and (c) climate change interact and have altered the variability among remaining depressional wetland ecosystems (i.e., ecosystem homogenization) in the PPR. We reviewed the existing literature to provide examples of wetland ecosystem homogenization, provide implications for wetland management, and identify informational gaps that require further study. We found evidence for spatial, hydrological, chemical, and biological homogenization of prairie-pothole wetlands. Our findings indicate that the maintenance of wetland ecosystem multifunctionality is dependent on the preservation and restoration of heterogenous wetland complexes, especially the restoration of small wetland basins.",2022,"","Water","14","19","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14193106","","#20996","McLean 2022","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-06 08:45:49)(Select): This looks at the prairie pothole region which includes Canada and US.

It has important implications for atmospheric chemistry, climate regulation, and sulphur transport from the marine to the atmospheric and terrestrial environments.

Micro-organisms that cycle DMS are widely distributed in a range of environments, for instance, oxic and anoxic marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats. Despite the importance of DMS that has been unearthed by many studies since the early 1970s, the understanding of the biochemistry, genetics, and ecology of DMS-degrading micro-organisms is still limited.

Conservation of prairie-oak butterflies offers unique opportunities and special challenges. Here we provide an overview of butterfly conservation in WPG prairies. We begin with a review of the status of at-risk butterfly species in the region, an introduction to five species that are the focus of current conservation efforts: Fender's blue (Icaricia icarioides fenderi), Taylor's checkerspot (Euphydryas editha taylori), mardon skipper (Polites mardon), island marble (Euchloe ausonides insulanus), and Oregon silverspot (Speyeria zerene hippolyta), and a brief review of 10 additional at-risk butterfly species in the ecoregion. We follow with a discussion of three key threats (habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive species, and lack of appropriate disturbance) and four dominant management approaches (fire, herbicides, mowing, and habitat restoration). We discuss current challenges and emerging issues for these species, and focus on invasive species management, understanding basic biology, conserving multiple species, and adapting to climate change. We highlight several success stories from around the region. We conclude that butterfly biologists and land managers in the WPG are in a unique position to conserve the region's threatened prairie butterflies.

To better understand the potential for assisted migration to benefit species threatened by climate change, we conducted an evidence synthesis to map examples where assisted migration has been implemented around the world. With this mapping exercise, we collate and describe the quantity and key characteristics of the available evidence base, including the taxa, species conservation status, locations, and contexts relating to the use of this conservation tactic. Findings from this exercise highlight that assisted migration has been implemented very few times as a conservation tactic, though assisted migration has been conducted experimentally (for research purposes) and inadvertently (e.g., for reforestation) much more frequently. Assisted migration was most common for plants (particularly trees), followed by birds, and was rarely implemented for other taxa.

S.","Globally, foliar pathogenic fungi cause serious losses of annual and perennial crops, ornamentals, landscape plants and forest trees. Plant pathogens that infect foliage are a diverse assemblage of fungi representing both phyla: Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Although most of the species found on living leaves have been well studied by mycologists and plant pathologists, recent studies have remarkably enhanced the current understanding of species numbers and their evolutionary relationships. The impact of global climate change, the increasing international exchange of plant material and the lack of proper phytosanitary practices have resulted in the potential re-emergences of formerly known destructive fungi, infecting new hosts in new geographic locations. Routinely inspecting diseased plants and accurately identifying and naming causative agents are vital for mitigating the impact of invasive and other non-indigenous pathogens on crops and native flora. It is also necessary to characterise foliar pathogenic fungi based on molecular phylogeny, morphology, pathogenicity and the comparative analysis of fungal genomic data.

R.; Starks, P. J.; Will, R. E.; Zhong, Yu; Acharya, B. S.","In the Great Plains of the central United States, water resources for human and aquatic life rely primarily on surface runoff and local recharge from rangelands that are under rapid transformation to woodland by the encroachment of Eastern redcedar (redcedar; Juniperus virginiana) trees. In this synthesis, the current understanding and impact of redcedar encroachment on the water budget and water resources available for non-ecosystem use are reviewed. Existing studies concluded that the conversion from herbaceous-dominated rangeland to redcedar woodland increases precipitation loss to canopy interception and vegetation transpiration. The decrease of soil moisture, particularly for the subsurface soil layer, is widely documented. The depletion of soil moisture is directly related to the observed decrease in surface runoff, and the potential of deep recharge for redcedar encroached watersheds. Model simulations suggest that complete conversion of the rangelands to redcedar woodland at the watershed and basin scale in the South-central Great Plains would lead to reduced streamflow throughout the year, with the reductions of streamflow between 20 to 40% depending on the aridity of the climate of the watershed. Recommended topics for future studies include: (i) The spatial dynamics of redcedar proliferation and its impact on water budget across a regional hydrologic network; (ii) the temporal dynamics of precipitation interception by the herbaceous canopy; (iii) the impact of redcedar infilling into deciduous forests such as the Cross Timbers and its impact on water budget and water availability for non-ecosystem use; (iv) land surface and climate interaction and cross-scale hydrological modeling and forecasting; (v) impact of redcedar encroachment on sediment production and water quality; and (vi) assessment and efficacy of different redcedar control measures in restoring hydrological functions of watershed.",2018,"","Water","10","12","1768","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10121768","","#24971","Zou 2018","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-15 11:38:00)(Select): The flow is water, water reduction due to the spread of redcedar - range is in US and extends up into Canada.

"35","A review of the interaction between forest birds and eastern spruce budworm","Venier, LA; Holmes, S B","The eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana Clem., (hereafter budworm) is responsible for the largest areas of insect-caused disturbance in North America, and as such, is an important part of spruce-fir forest change and succession. The insectivorous forest bird community shows large and rapid responses to budworm outbreaks. There is good evidence that there are budworm-linked species (bay-breasted, Cape May, and Tennessee warblers) that respond to budworm outbreak much more strongly and consistently than other species, probably through increased productivity of local populations when budworm are abundant. There also appears to be a more widespread positive bird community response to budworm outbreak that involves many more species. The response is evident in local and regional scale studies, but individual species' responses across studies are not always consistent, probably because of the relatively small number of studies conducted in a wide variety of contexts. Budworm outbreaks provide a short-term increase in food supply for birds, but also result in longer-term habitat change due to budworm-induced defoliation and tree mortality. Birds appear to influence budworm cycles, mostly at endemic population levels, through predation of large larvae and pupae. There are good arguments suggesting that bird predation is not the primary cause of budworm oscillations, but may play a role in determining the mean level of oscillations. Climate change is expected to change the bird-budworm relationship through changes in fire regimes, spruce-fir distributions, bird distributions, and budworm and bird phenology.Original Abstract: La tordeuse du bourgeon de l'epinette, Choristoneura fumiferana Clem., (ci-apres nommee tordeuse) est responsable des plus grandes superficies devastees par des insectes en Amerique du Nord, et comme telle joue un role important dans les changements et la succession des forets de sapin et d'epinette. La communaute des oiseaux forestiers insectivores reagit fortement et rapidement aux invasions par la tordeuse. Il semble evident qu'il existe des relations entre les especes liees a la tordeuse (parulines a flanc marron, du Cap May et du Tennessee) qui reagissent aux epidemies de tordeuses plus fortement et plus regulierement que les autres especes, probablement par une productivite accrue des populations locales lorsque les tordeuses sont abondantes. Il semble egalement y avoir plus de reactions positives et etendues de la communaute aviaire impliquant plusieurs autres especes. La reaction est evidente dans les etudes a l'echelle locale et regionale, mais les reactions des especes individuelles pour l'ensemble des especes ne sont pas toujours congrues, probablement liees au nombre relativement faible d'etudes conduites dans une grande variete de contexte. Les epidemies de tordeuses fournissent une augmentation a court terme de nourriture pour les oiseaux, mais conduisent aussi a des modifications a long terme de l'habitat suite a la defoliation causee par la tordeuse et la mortalite des arbres. Les oiseaux semblent influencer les cycles de la tordeuse, surtout a l'etat endemique des populations, par predation des grosses larves et des pupes. Il y a de bons arguments suggerant que la predation par les oiseaux ne constitue pas la cause primaire des oscillations de la tordeuse, mais pourrait jouer un role determinant dans le degre moyen d'oscillation.
