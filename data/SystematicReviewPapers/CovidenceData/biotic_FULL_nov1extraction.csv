K.; Yano, M.","Agriculture is now facing the perfect storm' of climate change, increasing costs of fertilizer and rising food demands from a larger and wealthier human population. These factors point to a global food deficit unless the efficiency and resilience of crop production is increased. The intensification of agriculture has focused on improving production under optimized conditions, with significant agronomic inputs. Furthermore, the intensive cultivation of a limited number of crops has drastically narrowed the number of plant species humans rely on. A new agricultural paradigm is required, reducing dependence on high inputs and increasing crop diversity, yield stability and environmental resilience. Genomics offers unprecedented opportunities to increase crop yield, quality and stability of production through advanced breeding strategies, enhancing the resilience of major crops to climate variability, and increasing the productivity and range of minor crops to diversify the food supply. Here we review the state of the art of genomic-assisted breeding for the most important staples that feed the world, and how to use and adapt such genomic tools to accelerate development of both major and minor crops with desired traits that enhance adaptation to, or mitigate the effects of climate change.",2016,"APR","Plant Biotechnology Journal","14","4","1095-1098","WOS:000373069400004","10.1111/pbi.12467","","#19","Abberton 2016","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"2","The Importance of Water Availability to Bats: Climate Warming and Increasing Global Aridity","Adams, R. A.; Hayes, M. A.; Lim, B. K.; Fenton, M. B.; Brigham, R. M.; Mistry, S.; Kurta, A.; Gillam, E. H.; Russell, A.; Ortega, J.","Environmental change due to climate warming is accelerating in most of the world's arid regions, pushing already xeric ecosystems towards drier conditions and expanding desert landscapes. These changes will alter community structures and species interactions globally. Because many arid regions, especially semi-arid zones, are relatively high in bat species richness, reactions of bat populations to increasing and intensifying droughts will affect food web dynamics and ecosystem services on nearly every continent. Although there is evidence that some species have preadaptations for surviving decreasing available water resources in arid regions, many species may succumb to the pace of climate warming and landscape xerification. As drought and aridity increase, many drinking sources will inevitably be lost, increasing competition for progressively limited resources, thereby affecting bats during the reproductive season when they are most vulnerable. Herein, we review how climate warming and increasing drought are currently altering bat population dynamics and model future viability of some species and populations. Documented declines in some bat populations, reductions in species richness, and changes in distributional ranges are already occurring in hardest hit areas and some models have been developed to predict future outcomes for bats living on the leading edge of climate disruption.",2021,"","50 YEARS OF BAT RESEARCH: Foundations and New Frontiers","","","105-120","WOS:000747823400011","10.1007/978-3-030-54727-1_710.1007/978-3-030-54727-1","","#96","Adams 2021","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"3","A Review of Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Coffee Cultivation and Mycotoxigenic Fungi","Adhikari, M.; Isaac, E. L.; Paterson, R. R. M.; Maslin, M. A.","Coffee is one of the most traded commodities in the world. It plays a significant role in the global economy, employing over 125 million people. However, it is possible that this vital crop is threatened by changing climate conditions and fungal infections. This paper reviews how suitable areas for coffee cultivation and the toxigenic fungi species of Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium will be affected due to climate change. By combining climate models with species distribution models, a number of studies have investigated the future distribution of coffee cultivation. Studies predict that suitable coffee cultivation area could drop by similar to 50% under representation concentration pathway (RCP) 6.0 by 2050 for both Arabica and Robusta. These findings agree with other studies which also see an altitudinal migration of suitable cultivation areas to cooler regions, but limited scope for latitudinal migration owing to coffee's inability to tolerate seasonal temperature changes. Increased temperatures will see an overall increase in mycotoxin production such as aflatoxins, particularly in mycotoxigenic fungi (e.g., Aspergillus flavus) more suited to higher temperatures. Arabica and Robusta's limited ability to relocate means both species will be grown in less suitable climates, increasing plant stress and making coffee more susceptible to fungal infection and mycotoxins. Information regarding climate change parameters with respect to mycotoxin concentrations in real coffee samples is provided and how the changed climate affects mycotoxins in non-coffee systems is discussed. In a few areas where relocating farms is possible, mycotoxin contamination may decrease due to the """"parasites lost"""" phenomenon. More research is needed to include the effect of mycotoxins on coffee under various climate change scenarios, as currently there is a significant knowledge gap, and only generalisations can be made. Future modelling of coffee cultivation, which includes the influence of atmospheric carbon dioxide fertilisation and forest management, is also required; however, all indications show that climate change will have an extremely negative effect on future coffee production worldwide in terms of both a loss of suitable cultivation areas and an increase in mycotoxin contamination.",2020,"OCT","Microorganisms","8","10","","WOS:000585269900001","10.3390/microorganisms8101625","","#106","Adhikari 2020","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"4","The freezer defrosting: global warming and litter decomposition rates in cold biomes","Aerts, R.","1 Decomposition of plant litter, a key component of the global carbon budget, is hierarchically controlled by the triad: climate > litter quality > soil organisms. Given the sensitivity of decomposition to temperature, especially in cold biomes, it has been hypothesized that global warming will lead to increased litter decomposition rates, both through direct temperature effects and through indirect effects on litter quality and soil organisms. 2 A meta-analysis of experimental warming studies in cold biomes (34 site-species combinations) showed that warming resulted in slightly increased decomposition rates. However, this response was strongly dependent on the method used: open top chambers reduced decomposition rates, whereas heating lamps stimulated decomposition rates. The low responsiveness was mainly due to moisture-limited decomposition rates in the warming treatments, especially at mesic and xeric sites. This control of litter decomposition by both temperature and moisture was corroborated by natural gradient studies. 3 Interspecific differences in litter quality and decomposability are substantially larger than warming-induced phenotypic responses. Thus, the changes in the species composition and structure of plant communities that have been observed in medium-term warming studies in cold biomes will have a considerably greater impact on ecosystem litter decomposition than phenotypic responses. 4 Soil fauna communities in cold biomes are responsive to climate warming. Moreover, temperature-driven migration of the, hitherto absent, large comminuters to high-latitude sites may significantly increase decomposition rates. However, we do not know how far-reaching the consequences of changes in the species composition and structure of the soil community are for litter decomposition, as there is a lack of data on functional species redundancy and the species' dispersal ability. 5 Global warming will lead to increased litter decomposition rates only if there is sufficient soil moisture. Hence, climate scenario and experimental studies should focus more on both factors and their interaction. As interspecific differences in potential decomposability and litter chemistry are substantially larger than phenotypic responses to warming, the focus of future research should be on the former. In addition, more light should be shed on the below-ground 'darkness' to evaluate the ecological significance of warming-induced soil fauna community changes for litter decomposition processes in cold biomes.",2006,"JUL","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","94","4","713-724","WOS:000237972700001","10.1111/j.1365-2745.2006.01142.x","","#120","Aerts 2006","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

K.; Arko-Mensah, J.; Issah, I.; Acquah, A. A.; Hogarh, J. N.; Dwomoh, D.; Robins, T. G.; Fobil, J. N.","The rearing temperature of the immature stages can have a significant impact on the life-history traits and the ability of adult mosquitoes to transmit diseases. This review assessed published evidence of the effects of temperature on the immature stages, life-history traits, insecticide susceptibility, and expression of enzymes in the adult Anopheles mosquito. Original articles published through 31 March 2021 were systematically retrieved from Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. After applying eligibility criteria, 29 studies were included. The review revealed that immature stages of An. arabiensis were more tolerant (in terms of survival) to a higher temperature than An. funestus and An. quadriannulatus. Higher temperatures resulted in smaller larval sizes and decreased hatching and pupation time. The development rate and survival of An. stephensi was significantly reduced at a higher temperature than a lower temperature. Increasing temperatures decreased the longevity, body size, length of the gonotrophic cycle, and fecundity of Anopheles mosquitoes. Higher rearing temperatures increased pyrethroid resistance in adults of the An. arabiensis SENN DDT strain, and increased pyrethroid tolerance in the An. arabiensis SENN strain. Increasing temperature also significantly increased Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) expression and decreased insecticide toxicity. Both extreme low and high temperatures affect Anopheles mosquito development and survival. Climate change could have diverse effects on Anopheles mosquitoes. The sensitivities of Anopeheles mosquitoes to temperature differ from species to species, even among the same complex. Notwithstanding, there seem to be limited studies on the effects of temperature on adult life-history traits of Anopheles mosquitoes, and more studies are needed to clarify this relationship.",2021,"JUL","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","18","14","","WOS:000677349100001","10.3390/ijerph18147255","","#154","Agyekum 2021","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-10 06:47:59)(Select): some of the papers reviewed are from north america (see figure 2). paper touches on northward shifting disease vectors, transboundary in North America is implicit but not explicit; ","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"6","The Acadian Forest of New Brunswick in the 21st century what shifting heat and water balance imply for future stand dynamics and management","Albert, C.; Taylor, A. R.; Logan, T.; D'Orangeville, L.","Climate change is altering the dynamics of New Brunswick's forests. To mitigate the effects of climate change, it is cru-cial to account for future uncertainties in climate projections and natural disturbance trajectories when designing forestry practices. This paper presents the projected changes in key climatic drivers for New Brunswick's forests, examines the im-pacts of climate change on forest stand dynamics, and reviews adaptive silviculture tools for climate change adaptation. By 2071-2100, a projected 4-6 degrees C increase in mean annual temperature will lead to a 39%-77% rise in growing degree-days and a reduction in summer atmospheric water balance by 48-79 mm across New Brunswick. Foresters should anticipate a doubling of annual area burned, the northward migration of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens)), and the introduction of novel insects and diseases. Forest simulation models project a severe decline in boreal tree species abundance, including a 50% decline in balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton et al.), offset by an increase in temperate species, notably red maple (Acer rubrum L.; +200%) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh; +135%). Forests in the highlands and lowlands ecoregions, with 40%-50% and 15%-30% spruce and balsam fir composition, respectively, are particularly vulnerable. To limit climate change effects on forest values, foresters must prioritize climate resiliency in their management plans. Strategies should ensure the steady provision of forest goods and services under changing climatic conditions. Forest thinning enhances stand productivity and resilience, while shelterwood and two-age harvest balances timber production with diversity. Clearcutting, despite drawbacks, establishes younger, more vigorous forests with higher carbon se-questration potential. Assisted migration offers promise in helping threatened tree species adapt. Climate change will have a significant impact on New Brunswick's forests, leading to changes in key climatic drivers, increased risks of disturbances, and a shift toward more temperate tree species. However, there are existing adaptation strategies available. It is crucial to consider future uncertainties when designing and evaluating forestry practices, as this is essential for mitigating the effects of climate change on forest values and ensuring the continued provision of forest goods and services over time.",2023,"DEC","Environmental Reviews","31","4","690-706","WOS:001094677400001","10.1139/er-2022-0122","","#267","Albert 2023","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-13 09:30:01)(Select): partially a review, partially a modeling study. including, but the useful info may stem from the modeling and therefore have to decide if this meets the criteria of being a review; ","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

J.; Ruiz-Sánchez, A.","Of the approximately 716 bird species that breed in North America, 386 (54%) are considered Nearctic-Neotropical migrants by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In the past 50 yr, scores of these migratory species, including some once considered common, have declined dramatically. Nearctic-Neotropical migrants normally spend 6-8 months in tropical habitats, making the identification, availability, and management of Neotropical habitats critical issues for their conservation. Yet, for most species, complete and nuanced information about their use of tropical habitats and the relative effects of breeding vs. wintering conditions on survival, productivity, and population trends is not available, though many studies point to Neotropical overwintering habitats as being a strong driver of population change. Particularly important for long-distance Nearctic-Neotropical migrants is an understanding of how""""carry-over effects"""" arise and influence population trends when conditions on wintering grounds and tropical stopover areas affect subsequent reproductive performance on breeding grounds. For example, why some species show strong carry-over effects from tropical habitats while others do not is not fully understood. I n recent years, many studies have offered insights into these issues by taking advantage of new scientific methods and technological innovations. In this review, we explore threats facing North American breeding birds that migrate to the Neotropics, summarize knowledge of habitat selection and use on the wintering grounds, describe how conditions at one point in the annual cycle may manifest in subsequent seasons or life history stages, and discuss conservation concerns such as climate change and the potential for phenological mismatch.",2020,"NOV","Condor","122","4","","WOS:000612517800020","10.1093/condor/duaa055","","#269","Albert 2020","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

M.","As a result of human activities, an ever-increasing portion of Earth's natural landscapes now lie adjacent to agricultural lands. This border between wild and agricultural communities represents an agro-ecological interface, which may be populated with crop plants, weeds of crop systems, and non-crop plants that vary from exotic to native in origin. Plant viruses are important components of the agro-ecological interface because of their ubiquity, dispersal by arthropod vectors, and ability to colonize both crop and wild species. Here we provide an overview of research on plant-virus dynamics across this interface and suggest three research priorities: (1) an increased effort to identify and describe plant virus diversity and distribution in its entirety across agricultural and ecological boundaries; (2) multi-scale studies of virus transmission to develop predictive power in estimating virus propagation across landscapes; and (3) quantitative evaluation of the influence of viruses on plant fitness and populations in environmental contexts beyond crop fields. We close by emphasizing that agro-ecological interfaces are dynamic, influenced by the human-mediated redistribution of plants, vectors, and viruses around the world, climate change, and the development of new crops. Consideration of virus interactions within these environmentally complex systems promises new insight into virus, plant, and vector dynamics from molecular mechanisms to ecological consequences.",2014,"MAR","European Journal of Plant Pathology","138","3","529-547","WOS:000331657800009","10.1007/s10658-013-0317-1","","#286","Alexander 2014","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"9","Likely Geographic Distributional Shifts among Medically Important Tick Species and Tick-Associated Diseases under Climate Change in North America: A Review","Alkishe, A.; Raghavan, R. K.; Peterson, A. T.","Simple Summary North America is considered as an area likely to be significantly affected by global warming, with climate change causing markedly warmer winter temperatures in the United States in recent decades. Ticks are sensitive to changes in ambient abiotic conditions and, therefore, climate: they are poikilothermic, with the life stages of each species requiring specific sets of environmental conditions for successful development and survival. Our review focuses on (1) identifying and exploring suitable areas for the eight medically important vector tick species in North America; (2) exploring whether and how species' distributions are likely to shift in coming decades in response to climate change, and in what ways; (3) and providing a picture on the status of the tick-associated diseases in North America from the present to the future. Ticks rank high among arthropod vectors in terms of numbers of infectious agents that they transmit to humans, including Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Colorado tick fever, human monocytic ehrlichiosis, tularemia, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Increasing temperature is suspected to affect tick biting rates and pathogen developmental rates, thereby potentially increasing risk for disease incidence. Tick distributions respond to climate change, but how their geographic ranges will shift in future decades and how those shifts may translate into changes in disease incidence remain unclear. In this study, we have assembled correlative ecological niche models for eight tick species of medical or veterinary importance in North America (Ixodes scapularis, I. pacificus, I. cookei, Dermacentor variabilis, D. andersoni, Amblyomma americanum, A. maculatum, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus), assessing the distributional potential of each under both present and future climatic conditions. Our goal was to assess whether and how species' distributions will likely shift in coming decades in response to climate change. We interpret these patterns in terms of likely implications for tick-associated diseases in North America.",2021,"MAR","Insects","12","3","","WOS:000633782200001","10.3390/insects12030225","","#322","Alkishe 2021","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

H.; Allard, G.; Running, S. W.; Semerci, A.; Cobb, N.","Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.

Through a systematic review of empirical literature on these blooms and invasions, we explore the prevalence of conventional analyses of environmental, economic, and social impacts, as well as opportunities for adaptation and valorisation. The study reveals crucial inconsistencies in the current evidence base on algae impacts: fragmented metrics for quantifying blooms and their effects; inconsistent application and testing of prevention measures (e.g. forecasting, early warning systems); reliance on removal as a management approach with limited evidence of associated costs; and scant evidence of the effectiveness of impact mitigation or adaptation strategies. With a focus on economic and societal dimensions of algae events, we introduce emerging opportunities within the blue economy for bloom utilization.

"12","Microbial communities in natural and disturbed peatlands: A review","Andersen, R.; Chapman, S. J.; Artz, R. R. E.","Even though large extents of boreal peatlands are still in a pristine condition, especially in North America, extensive areas have been affected by natural or anthropogenic disturbances that change some of the systems from being sinks to sources of carbon dioxide and shift the methane production/consumption patterns through alterations of both above- and below-ground communities and functions. In order to fully assess the role of peatlands on global C balance, now and in the future, it is imperative that we deepen our understanding of the relative contributions of various groups of microorganisms to organic matter transformations. Here, we review the drivers structuring fungal, bacterial and archaeal communities in natural peatlands and the response of these microbial communities to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, including fire, drainage, nutrient deposition, peat mining and climate change. The microbial diversity in peatlands is characterized by organisms that have developed physiological and metabolic adaptations to cope with the constraining conditions found in these ecosystems, such as low oxygen availability, cold temperature, acidity and oligotrophy. Furthermore, these unique organisms sometimes appear to be organized as repeat mosaics responding to vegetation, physicochemical and hydrological characteristics more than to geographical distance, in other words, similar to the much valued biodiversity aspects of the peatland vegetation itself and associated higher organisms. The response of microbial communities to disturbances is far from fully understood. In particular, whilst many studies have identified changes in microbial community composition or on microbially driven processes following a given disturbance, it remains unclear how the two components, diversity and function, relate with each other. Future challenges involve designing studies that will test whether ecological theories like species sorting, stress physiology, temporal niche or functional redundancy can be used to understand what regulates microbial populations and activity in peatlands, and studies that will allow us to predict more accurately how peatlands respond to global change or anthropogenic disturbances.

P.; Fyfe, C.; Yates, M.; Khusro, M.","To understand how researchers are tackling globally important issues, it is crucial to identify whether current research is comprehensive enough to make substantive predictions about general responses. We examined how research on climate change affecting insects is being assessed, what factors are being tested and the localities of studies, from 1703 papers published between 1985 and August 2012. Most published research (64%) is generated from Europe and North America and being dedicated to core data analysis, with 29% of the studies analysed dedicated to Lepidoptera and 22% Diptera: which are well above their contribution to the currently identified insect species richness (estimated at 13% and 17% respectively). Research publications on Coleoptera fall well short of their proportional contribution (19% of publications but 39% of insect species identified), and to a lesser extent so do Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera. Species specific responses to changes in temperature by assessing distribution/range shifts or changes in abundance were the most commonly used methods of assessing the impact of climate change on insects. Research on insects and climate change to date is dominated by manuscripts assessing butterflies in Europe, insects of economic and/or environmental concern in forestry, agriculture, and model organisms. The research on understanding how insects will respond to a rapidly changing climate is still in its infancy, but the current trends of publications give a good basis for how we are attempting to assess insect responses. In particular, there is a crucial need for broader studies of ecological, behavioural, physiological and life history responses to be addressed across a greater range of geographic locations, particularly Asia, Africa and Australasia, and in areas of high human population growth and habitat modification. It is still too early in our understanding of taxa responses to climate change to know if charismatic taxa, such as butterflies, or disease vectors, including Diptera, can be used as keystone taxa to generalise other insect responses to climate change. This is critical as the basic biology of most species is still poorly known, and dominant, well studied taxa may show variable responses to climate change across their distribution due to regional biotic and abiotic influences. Indeed identifying if insect responses to climate change can be generalised using phylogeny, functional traits, or functional groups, or will populations and species exhibit idiosyncratic responses, should be a key priority for future research.",2013,"FEB 12","PeerJ","1","","","WOS:000209185300010","10.7717/peerj.11","","#474","Andrew 2013","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Disturbance is any distinct spatiotemporal event that disrupts the structure and composition of an ecosystem affecting resource availability. We developed a Python package to automate search term selection, write search strategies, reduce bias and improve the efficient and effective selection of articles from academic databases and grey literature. We identified 148 peer-reviewed literature published between 1986 and 2022 and conducted an inductive and deductive thematic analysis of the results. Our findings revealed that CEA studies are concentrated in the global north, with most publications from authors affiliated with government agencies in the USA and Canada. Methodological and analytical approaches are less interdisciplinary but mainly quantitative and expert-driven, involving modeling the impacts of disturbances on biophysical valued components. Furthermore, the assessment of socioeconomic valued components, including the effects of disturbance on Indigenous wellbeing connected to forests, has received less attention. Even though there is a high preference for regional assessment, challenges with data access, quality, and analysis, especially baseline data over long periods, are hampering effective CEA. Few articles examined CEA - policy/management nexus. Of the few studies, challenges such as the inadequate implementation of CEA mitigation strategies due to policy drawbacks and resource constraints, the high cost of monitoring multiple indicators, and poor connections between scenarios/modeling and management actions were paramount.

"15","A critical review of successional dynamics in boreal forests of North America","Anyomi, K. A.; Neary, B.; Chen, J. X.; Mayor, S. J.","Forest succession is a dynamic process of progressive compositional development of ecological communities of species following natural or anthropogenic disturbance. Despite a rich history of conceptual frameworks, models, and empirical advances, the complex interactions among climatic conditions, disturbances, edaphic factors, and silvicultural treatments still challenge our ability to accurately predict forest succession, hindering application to forest management. Our goal was to improve understanding of forest succession in the managed boreal forests of North America by clarifying advances in knowledge and limitations in our understanding. We reviewed 152 peer-reviewed papers to: (i) document conceptual developments in forest succession; (ii) summarize drivers of North American boreal forest succession, including changes to forest composition and successional trajectories given climate change; and (iii) discuss the implications of the synthesized information for boreal forest management. While the element of stochasticity is expected to increase under climate change, successional dynamics are anticipated to remain predominantly deterministic. Southern boreal forests are at increased risk of mortality due to warming-driven drought and increased fires. Following disturbance, regeneration is likely to favor deciduous hardwoods. In boreal mixedwoods, increased fires would promote jack pine, and also black spruce on hydric and xeric sites. Dynamics of the northern boreal will depend on the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration. Forest management must carefully select prescriptions to promote forest regeneration and composition that consider the long-term effects of changing climate and disturbance regimes. For instance, combining retention cut with mechanical site preparation would maintain site productivity and reverse open black spruce stand development in northern boreal stands. Our work shows that multiple disturbances have compounding effects on forest development, but further work is needed to better define thresholds for synergistic and buffering interactions. Modeling of boreal forest succession can be improved by incorporating more of the influential factors, but this is often limited by the lack of data. This information will guide the development of forest management strategies by exploring combinations of prescribed fire and variable intensity selection cutting systems to reproduce the effects of multiple interacting natural disturbances under climate change on successional dynamics.",2022,"2022 AUG 19","Environmental Reviews","","","","WOS:000844986800001","10.1139/er-2021-0106","","#520","Anyomi 2022","","Biotic; Intervention; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

A.; Keshavmurthy, S.; Chen, A.; Schleyer, M. H.; Sheppard, C. R. C.","Most reviews concerning the impact of climate change on coral reefs discuss independent effects of warming or ocean acidification. However, the interactions between these, and between these and direct local stressors are less well addressed. This review underlines that coral bleaching, acidification, and diseases are expected to interact synergistically, and will negatively influence survival, growth, reproduction, larval development, settlement, and post-settlement development of corals. Interactions with local stress factors such as pollution, sedimentation, and overfishing are further expected to compound effects of climate change. Reduced coral cover and species composition following coral bleaching events affect coral reef fish community structure, with variable outcomes depending on their habitat dependence and trophic specialisation. Ocean acidification itself impacts fish mainly indirectly through disruption of predation- and habitat-associated behavior changes. Zooxanthellate octocorals on reefs are often overlooked but are substantial occupiers of space; these also are highly susceptible to bleaching but because they tend to be more heterotrophic, climate change impacts mainly manifest in terms of changes in species composition and population structure. Non-calcifying macroalgae are expected to respond positively to ocean acidification and promote microbe-induced coral mortality via the release of dissolved compounds, thus intensifying phase-shifts from coral to macroalgal domination. Adaptation of corals to these consequences of CO2 rise through increased tolerance of corals and successful mutualistic associations between corals and zooxanthellae is likely to be insufficient to match the rate and frequency of the projected changes. Impacts are interactive and magnified, and because there is a limited capacity for corals to adapt to climate change, global targets of carbon emission reductions are insufficient for coral reefs, so lower targets should be pursued. Alleviation of most local stress factors such as nutrient discharges, sedimentation, and overfishing is also imperative if sufficient overall resilience of reefs to climate change is to be achieved.

In response to a clear need to identify traits that are responsive to climate change and applicable in amanagement context, we review the state of knowledge of the main mechanisms, and their associated traits, that underpin the ability of boreal and temperate tree species to persist and (or) shift their distribution in a changing climate. We aimed to determine whether current knowledge is sufficiently mature and available to be used effectively in vulnerability assessments. Marshalling recent conceptual advances and assessing data availability, our ultimate objective is to guide modellers and practitioners in finding and selecting sets of traits that can be used to capture differences in species' ability to persist and migrate. While the physiological mechanisms that determine sensitivity to climate change are relatively well understood (e.g., drought-induced cavitation), manyassociated traits have not been systematically documented for North American trees and differences in methodology preclude their widespread integration into vulnerability assessments (e.g., xylem recovery capacity). In contrast, traits traditionally associated with the ability to migrate and withstand fire are generally well documented, but new key traits are emerging in the context of climate change that have not been as well characterized (e.g., age of optimum seed production). More generally, lack of knowledge surrounding the extent and patterns in intraspecific trait variation, as well as co-variation and interaction among traits, limit our ability to use this approach to assess tree adaptive capacity.

F.","AimTo analyse global patterns of climate during the mid-Holocene and conduct comparisons with pre-industrial and projected future climates. In particular, to assess the exposure of terrestrial biomes and ecoregions to climate-related risks during the Holocene-Anthropocene transition starting at the pre-industrial period. LocationTerrestrial ecosystems of the Earth. MethodsWe calculated long-term climate differences (anomalies) between the mid-Holocene (6 ka cal bp, mH), pre-industrial conditions and projections for 2100 (middle-strength A1B scenario) using six global circulation models available for all periods. Climate differences were synthesized with multivariate statistics and average principal component loadings of temperature and precipitation differences (an estimate of climate-related risks) were calculated on 14 biomes and 766 ecoregions. ResultsOur results suggest that most of the Earth's biomes will probably undergo changes beyond the mH recorded levels of community turnover and range shifts because the magnitude of climate anomalies expected in the future are greater than observed during the mH. A few biomes, like the remnants of North American and Euro-Asian prairies, may experience only slightly greater degrees of climate change in the future as compared with the mH. In addition to recent studies that have identified equatorial regions as the most sensitive to future climate change, we find that boreal forest, tundra and vegetation of the Equatorial Andes could be at greatest risk, since these regions will be exposed to future climates that are well outside natural climate variation during the Holocene. ConclusionsThe Holocene-Anthropocene climate transition, even for a middle-strength future climate change scenario, appears to be of greater magnitude and different from that between the mH and the pre-industrial period. As a consequence, community- and biome-level changes due to of expected climate change may be different in the future from those observed during the mH.",2014,"FEB","Global Ecology and Biogeography","23","2","235-244","WOS:000329139600010","10.1111/geb.12097","","#1063","Benito-Garzón 2014","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

D.; Ng, V.; Ludwig, A.; Sadeghieh, T.; Menzies, P.; Mubareka, S.; Clow, K. M.","Background: Mosquito-borne orthobunyaviruses are a growing priority for public and animal health in Canada. It is anticipated that disease incidence will increase due to a warming climate, given that habitats are expanding for reservoir hosts and vectors, particularly in Canada. Little is known about the ecology of primary vectors that perpetuate these orthobunyaviruses, including the viral transmission cycle and the impact of climatic and landscape factors.Methods: A scoping review was conducted to describe the current state of knowledge on the epidemiology of orthobunyaviruses relevant to Canada. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines was used to characterize studies focused on vector species. A literature search was conducted in six databases and gray literature. Eligible studies characterized orthobunyavirus epidemiology related to vector species, including viral competency, geospatial distributions, seasonal trends, and/or risk factors.Results: A total of 1734 unique citations were identified. Screening of these citations revealed 172 relevant studies, from which 87 studies presented primary data related to vectors. The orthobunyaviruses included Cache Valley virus (CVV), Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), Snowshoe Hare virus (SHV), and La Crosse virus (LACV). Surveillance was the predominant study focus, with most citations representing the United States, specifically, LACV surveillance in Tennessee, followed by CVV and JCV in Connecticut. Orthobunyaviruses were detected in many mosquito species across multiple genera, with high vector specificity only being reported for LACV, which included Aedes triseriatus, Aedes albopictus, and Aedes japonicus. Peridomestic areas were positively associated with infected mosquitoes compared with dense forests. Orthobunyavirus infections, coinfections, and gut microbiota affected mosquito feeding and breeding behavior.Conclusion: Knowledge gaps included Canadian surveillance data, disease modeling, and risk projections. Further research in these areas, especially accounting for climate change, is needed to guide health policy for prevention of orthobunyaviral disease.",2024,"2024 APR 30","VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES","","","","WOS:001210053000001","10.1089/vbz.2023.0152","","#1098","Bergevin 2024","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This review provides an overview of factors contributing to these declines, as well as strategies and resources available to a diversity of stakeholders to help conserve grassland bird communities with an emphasis on the Great Plains-a grassland region of global ecological significance and a habitat stronghold for grassland birds. Grassland bird declines are driven by historical and continuing threats across the full annual cycle including grassland habitat loss, agriculture intensification, woody encroachment, and disruption of fire and grazing regimes. More recently, energy development activities, the use of neonicotinoid pesticides, and anthropogenic climate change have emerged as additional threats. While threats to grassland birds are numerous and often synergistic, possibilities for conservation are also diverse and multifaceted. Land set-aside programs, incentives and voluntary practices for producers, improved environmental management by energy and utility companies, and policy and regulation can all contribute to the conservation of these unique species. We suggest that future grassland bird research should focus on poorly studied aspects of the annual cycle, such as overwinter survival and habitat use, and the migratory period, which remains completely unexplored for many species. Filling these knowledge gaps may facilitate more sophisticated population modeling that can identify limiting factors and more effectively guide investment in conservation. (c) 2023 The Authors.

R.; Van Buskirk, J.","Spring migration of birds in many parts of the world has advanced as the climate has become warmer. Variation in advancement among species has been proposed to correlate with geography and life history features, but individual studies have reported variable results, and general patterns have been elusive. In a quantitative review of data from 389 bird species sampled at 69 European and 23 North American localities, we evaluated associations between change in the timing of migration and life history (body size, molt, broodedness), ecology (habitat, diet, nest position), and geography. We confirmed that spring migration advanced: -0.214 d yr(-1) (95% CI: -0.266, -0.162) for first-arriving individuals and -0.104 d yr(-1) (-0.139, -0.071) for the median date of passage. The rate of change in autumn was more variable: 0.090 d yr(-1) (0.002, 0.176) delay for median passage and 0.019 d yr(-1) (-0.175, 0.204) delay for the date of last departure. The response during spring was weaker in the far north and in species that migrate long distances to the wintering area. Autumn migration became increasingly delayed in species that are large-bodied, molt before departure, and that feed on seeds, insects, or fruits. Variation among species, especially during autumn, was associated in part with constraints surrounding the timing of the postnuptial molt. The results suggest that ecological and life history features of species may influence their ability to respond to climate change.",2014,"SEP","Climate Research","61","2","109-121","WOS:000343963700002","10.3354/cr01238","","#1227","Bitterlin 2014","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

G.","Alder trees (Alnus spp.) are key nitrogen-fixing riparian species in the northern hemisphere. Inputs of nitrogen-rich leaf litter from alder into stream food webs can contribute significantly to nitrogen dynamics at local and landscape scales. Alder trees also provide habitats for terrestrial and aquatic organisms, and help stabilize river banks. Recently, substantial declines in alder stands have occurred along streams in Europe, with damages observed in some parts of North America also. A major driver has been the invasive oomycete pathogen Phytophthora alni species complex, which can spread rapidly along stream networks. This review synthesises information on the pathogen, processes of spread and infection, and its impacts on alder. We further address the potential ecosystem-level and management consequences of the decline of alder, and highlight research needs. The alder dieback caused by P. alni is associated with reductions in shade and quality and quantity of leaf litter. A decline in the structural integrity of branches and roots further threatens bank stability. Stream banks dominated by other tree species or no trees at all will result in ecosystem-level changes both above and below the waterline. The P. alni taxonomic complex includes different species with varying phenotypes. An improved understanding of their environmental tolerances, virulence and evolution, along with the processes regulating the spread and impacts of the pathogen, would assist in identification of the riparian and stream systems most vulnerable not only to invasion but also to the heaviest disease outbreaks and ecosystem-level impacts. Within the P. alni complex, the highly pathogenic hybrid species P. x alni is favoured by mild winters and warm, but not excessively hot summer temperatures suggesting possible changes in distribution and level of impact under future global climate change.",2016,"MAY","Freshwater Biology","61","5","565-579","WOS:000373833400001","10.1111/fwb.12729","","#1231","Bjelke 2016","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"25","Importance of climate change for the ranges, communities and conservation of birds","Böhning-Gaese, K.; Lemoine, N.; Moller, A. P.; Fielder, W.; Berthold, P.","In this review, we focus on the effects of global climate change on the size and position of geographic ranges and the richness and composition of bird communities. Plenty of evidence exists demonstrating that range boundaries of birds are correlated with climatic factors. In general, the northern range limit of species seems to be influenced rather by abiotic factors such as cold temperatures. The southern range limit of species appears to be determined by climatic factors such as heat or lack of water in and regions and by biotic factors in more humid regions. For communities, species richness is best predicted by measures of ambient temperature at high latitudes and by water-related variables in low-latitude, high-temperature regions. Models predicting range changes under climate change show idiosyncratic responses of different species with range contractions being more frequent than range expansions. Range shifts have been observed in temperate regions with northward shifts of northern range boundaries and no consistent trend of southern range boundaries. Further, upslope movements have been observed on a tropical mountain. For communities, increases in species richness are predicted for northern latitude and high-elevation sites and declines of species richness in and regions. With increasing winter temperature, declines in the proportion of migratory species in bird communities have been predicted and observed. Conservation consequences of global climate change are especially high threats to species in and environments, expected movements of species out of protected areas and increasing land use conflicts. In general, surprisingly few studies document effects of climate change on birds' ranges and communities.

However, little is known on how inland SAV quantities are changing globally in response to human activities, where loss threatens the provisioning of these ecosystem services. In this study, we generate a comprehensive global synthesis of trends in SAV quantities using time series (> 10 years) in lakes and identify their main drivers. We compiled trends across methods and metrics, integrating both observational and paleolimnological approaches as well as diverse measures of SAV quantities, including areal extent, density, or abundance classes. The compilation revealed that knowledge on SAV is mostly derived from temperate regions, with major gaps in tropical, boreal, and mountainous lake-rich regions. Similar to other wetland types, we found that 41% of SAV times series are largely decreasing mostly due to land use change and resulting eutrophication. SAV is, however, increasing in 28% of cases, primarily since the 1980s. We show that trends and drivers of SAV quantities vary regionally, with increases in Europe explained mainly by management, decreases in Asia due to eutrophication and land use change, and variable trends in North America consistent with invasive species arrival. By providing a quantitative portrait of trends in SAV quantities worldwide, we identify knowledge gaps and future SAV research priorities.

Striking are the few barnacle invasions that have occurred on the Pacific coast of South America and these species (A. improvisus, A. amphitrite and A. reticulatus) are reported only from northernmost locations (Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru). For the first 100 years (1853-1955) two species, A. amphitrite and A. improvisus, constituted the majority of invasion events in the Americas, the sole exception being the arrival of the Pacific Balanus trigonus in the 1860s and 1870s in the Atlantic. After 1955, the first records of invasions of A. reticulatus, A. eburneus, B. glandula, M. coccopoma, and S. amaryllis appear, an increased diversity of introductions in close concert with general observations of increasing invasions globally of marine organisms after World War II. Known since the 1970s in Brazil, M. coccopoma appears to be responding to warming northern latitudes and has expanded to North Carolina as of 2005. The native Western Atlantic barnacle Chthamalus fragilis arrived in New England in the 1890s, a range expansion perhaps facilitated by an earlier coastal warming period concomitant with the decline in abundance of its colder-water competitor Semibalanus balanoides, although the latter also appears to have expanded south on the North American Atlantic coast in the twentieth century due to increased habitat availability. Chthamalus is predicted to move north, and Semibalanus is predicted to return to its historical range, both due to continued warming. In turn, the native Eastern North Pacific barnacle Tetraclita rubescens is expanding north due to coastal warming as well. Future invasion scenarios include increased introductions facilitated through a newly expanded Panama Canal, the potential arrival of Austrominius modestus on the North American Atlantic coast (despite its failure to do so throughout the last half of the twentieth century), and the arrival on the warmer North and Central American Pacific coasts of Chthamalus proteus.",2011,"","IN THE WRONG PLACE - ALIEN MARINE CRUSTACEANS: DISTRIBUTION, BIOLOGY AND IMPACTS","6","","159-213","WOS:000293984800005","10.1007/978-94-007-0591-3_510.1007/978-94-007-0591-3","","#1852","Carlton 2011","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"31","Rewilding in the face of climate change","Carroll, C.; Noss, R. F.","Expansion of the global protected-area network has been proposed as a strategy to address threats from accelerating climate change and species extinction. A key step in increasing the effectiveness of such expansion is understanding how novel threats to biodiversity from climate change alter concepts such as rewilding, which have underpinned many proposals for large interconnected reserves. We reviewed potential challenges that climate change poses to rewilding and found that the conservation value of large protected areas persists under climate change. Nevertheless, more attention should be given to protection of microrefugia, macrorefugia, complete environmental gradients, and areas that connect current and future suitable climates and to maintaining ecosystem processes and stabilizing feedbacks via conservation strategies that are resilient to uncertainty regarding climate trends. Because a major element of the threat from climate change stems from its novel geographic patterns, we examined, as an example, the implications for climate-adaptation planning of latitudinal, longitudinal (continental to maritime), and elevational gradients in climate-change exposure across the Yellowstone-to-Yukon region, the locus of an iconic conservation proposal initially designed to conserve wide-ranging carnivore species. In addition to a continued emphasis on conserving intact landscapes, restoration of degraded low-elevation areas within the region is needed to capture sites important for landscape-level climate resilience. Extreme climate exposure projected for boreal North America suggests the need for ambitious goals for expansion of the protected-area network there to include refugia created by topography and ecological features, such as peatlands, whose conservation can also reduce emissions from carbon stored in soil. Qualitative understanding of underlying reserve design rules and the geography of climate-change exposure can strengthen the outcomes of inclusive regional planning processes that identify specific sites for protection.",2021,"FEB","Conservation Biology","35","1","155-167","WOS:000536718800001","10.1111/cobi.13531","","#1882","Carroll 2021","","Biotic; Intervention; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

A.; GilPelegrin, E.; PegueroPina, J. J.; SanchoKnapik, D.","Climate is known to be a critical factor controlling the broad-scale distribution of plants but often the physiological basis for species distribution limits is not well understood, nor is the extent to which populations within species are locally adapted to climate. Reciprocal transplant experiments designed to test for local adaptation are difficult to conduct and interpret in long-lived species, like oaks. Linking the physiological tolerances of species to their climatic distributions is an alternative approach to understanding adaptation to climate, and is important in predicting future distributions of species under changing climatic conditions. Here we synthesize a series of studies in a single lineage of American oaks that span the temperate tropical divide and encompass a range of precipitation and edaphic regimes, to determine (1) the physiological basis for adaptation to seasonal winter and seasonal drought and (2) the variation among populations that associated with climate variation and can be interpreted as local adaptation. We focus primarily on a series of common gardens that allow us to determine the genetically based differences in functional and physiological traits as well as the genetically based responses to contrasting temperature or precipitation regimes. We show that variation in freezing tolerance among closely related species is greater than variation among populations within species. Nevertheless, freezing tolerance varies predictably with climate of origin and is negatively associated with growth rate. In contrast, drought tolerance mechanisms vary more among populations within a single species, at least for the most widely distributed species, Quercus oleoides, than between species. Within this species, climate of origin predicts a suite of leaf physiological traits, and there is evidence for evolutionary trade-off between desiccation avoidance and desiccation resistance. Combined, these results show evidence for local adaptation to both freezing and drought stress within species, as well as adaptive differentiation between closely related species, despite phylogenetic conservatism in functional traits and highly similar physiognomy across the American live oak clade. The results inform conservation efforts aimed at preventing extinction of tree species in the face of global change.",2017,"","OAKS PHYSIOLOGICAL ECOLOGY.

(wild lettuce) is a highly invasive C-3 weed in many countries, including Australia, Canada, and the USA. This weed is a severe threat to agricultural systems, especially in crops grown with reduced or no-tillage approaches, which commonly include wheat, cereals and pulses. Owing to the vertical orientation of its leaves in the north-south plane and its root architecture, L. serriola can maintain high water use efficiency under drought conditions, giving it the ability to expand its range under a drying climate. Each plant can produce up to 100,000 seeds which have no primary dormancy and form a short-term seedbank lasting up to three years. Most seedlings emerge in autumn and overwinter as a rosette, with a small flush of emergence in spring depicting staggered germination. Research into control methods for this weed has been performed, and these methods include chemical herbicides applied alone and in combination, the establishment of plant competition, tillage, mowing and bioherbicide. Herbicides can provide effective control when applied in the seedling or rosette stage; however, spring germination is difficult to control, as it skips the rosette stage. Some biotypes are now resistant to ALS inhibitor and synthetic auxins, causing concern regarding using herbicides. A dedicated integrated management plan for 3-4 years is recommended for the control of this troublesome species. This review will explore the biology, ecology, distribution, current control techniques and previous research on this weed, allowing us to make recommendations for its future research and management.",2021,"OCT","PLANTS-BASEL","10","10","","WOS:000714649700001","10.3390/plants10102157","","#1972","Chadha 2021","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

K.","Concerns that climate warming may drive the spread of ectoparasites into previously uninhabited areas have increased the need for baseline knowledge of their distributional history. For species of wildlife health concern, presence data are often lacking or outdated, thus limiting our ability to assess range changes and subsequent host impacts. We reconstructed the past and present distribution of the winter tick, Dermacentor albipictus, through the compilation of a spatiotemporal database to create the first full baseline map of its occurrence throughout its North American range. The ongoing impacts of winter tick epizootics in moose (Alces alces) and recent mortality events in elk (Cervus canadensis) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have led to a resurgence in interest in the future of this parasite in a warming climate. Over 3400 unique records of winter tick occurrence were compiled from multiple data sources, dating from 1869 to 2020 and spanning from 16.5 to 66.2 degrees N latitude. Both conventional published sources and natural history records were included along with new records from previously unpublished datasets and citizen science observations, to make this a comprehensive occurrence dataset for this species. Along with standardized location information and year of observation, the dataset includes associated host species and descriptive categorization of the type and source of each record, providing new opportunities to examine host-parasite interactions in the winter tick system over time and space. In presenting these data, we discuss the potential sampling biases and lacunas in our integrated database records, particularly at the winter tick's northernmost range. We also document changes in the types and sources of winter tick information from past to present, highlighting potential issues that should be considered before using these data in further analyses and when collecting ongoing records.

A review of the recruitment biology of winter annual weeds in Canada. Can. J. Plant Sci. 89: 575-589. Typically, Summer annual weeds have been the primary management target for field crop farmers in Canada, but with changes in cropping systems and with acknowledged global climate change there will be an increasing need to consider the management of species that are present very early in the spring, including winter annual weeds. Knowledge of weed recruitment biology and emergence patterns can be used to guide weed management practices. A review was conducted of the recruitment biology of winter annual weeds in Canada. The key finding was that all of the significant winter annual weeds in Canadian agriculture are facultative, with the majority of species emerging at two peak periods, April-May and September-October. For the weed species included in this review, the information available on recruitment and seed biology was far from comprehensive, and for some species there was very little published information, in particular on specific base temperatures for germination, documented field-based emergence periods and data that could be used to create simple predictive population dynamics models, including fecundity (x environment), seed longevity and overwintering probability. This is particularly true with respect to information in Canadian agricultural contexts. A number of questions result from this review, a key one being whether spring versus fall emergence creates significant differences in fundamental biological characteristics of winter annual weeds including seed dormancy status, microsite requirements, phenology, plant vigour and competitive ability. Given that none of the winter annuals in Canada are constitutive and given ongoing climate change, farmers in Canada should be careful not to encourage summer annuals to become winter annuals. Movement away from fall weed management, including tillage and repeated sowing of winter annual crops will encourage facultative winter annual behaviour. In addition, farmers should be wary of invasion by populations of persistent winter annuals including stinkweed, chickweed and American dragonhead.",2009,"MAY","Canadian Journal of Plant Science","89","3","575-589","WOS:000266473000020","10.4141/CJPS08131","","#2292","Cici 2009","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-13 09:56:49)(Select): canada-centric but includes some information on US - therefore considering this implicitly transboundary for some weeds;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

E.","We synthesize insights from current understanding of drought impacts at stand-to-biogeographic scales, including management options, and we identify challenges to be addressed with new research. Large stand-level shifts underway in western forests already are showing the importance of interactions involving drought, insects, and fire. Diebacks, changes in composition and structure, and shifting range limits are widely observed. In the eastern US, the effects of increasing drought are becoming better understood at the level of individual trees, but this knowledge cannot yet be confidently translated to predictions of changing structure and diversity of forest stands. While eastern forests have not experienced the types of changes seen in western forests in recent decades, they too are vulnerable to drought and could experience significant changes with increased severity, frequency, or duration in drought. Throughout the continental United States, the combination of projected large climate-induced shifts in suitable habitat from modeling studies and limited potential for the rapid migration of tree populations suggests that changing tree and forest biogeography could substantially lag habitat shifts already underway. Forest management practices can partially ameliorate drought impacts through reductions in stand density, selection of drought-tolerant species and genotypes, artificial regeneration, and the development of multistructured stands. However, silvicultural treatments also could exacerbate drought impacts unless implemented with careful attention to site and stand characteristics. Gaps in our understanding should motivate new research on the effects of interactions involving climate and other species at the stand scale and how interactions and multiple responses are represented in models. This assessment indicates that, without a stronger empirical basis for drought impacts at the stand scale, more complex models may provide limited guidance.",2016,"JUL","Global Change Biology","22","7","2329-2352","WOS:000378722000005","10.1111/gcb.13160","","#2315","Clark 2016","Anna LoPresti (2024-10-16 05:39:38)(Select): agree with Anabel, that line and a few others reference transboundary movement and includes examples in mexico and canada. the transboundary aspect is not very substantive (not sure how much we can extract) but it is there so including. ; Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-15 12:41:47)(Select): This line makes me think more transboundary effects can be extracted: """"Extensive drought across much of the

We further demonstrate that available evidence offers little indication of a significant, independent influence of biotic interactions or dispersal limitation on species distributions. Disturbance may provide important constraints on distributions in limited contexts.

Intense livestock production, increased travel, and changing climate have increased the risk of catastrophic animal losses due to infectious diseases. In the event of an outbreak, it is essential to properly manage the infected animals to prevent the spread of diseases. The most common disposal methods used during a disease outbreak include burial, landfilling, incineration and composting. Biosecurity, transportation logistics, public perception, and environmental concerns limit the use of some of these methods. During a disease outbreak, the large number of mortalities often exceeds the capacity of local rendering plants and landfills. Transporting mortalities to disposal and incineration facilities outside the production operation introduces biosecurity risks. Burying mortalities is limited by the size and availability of suitable sites and it has the risk of pathogen survival and contamination of groundwater and soil. Portable incinerators are expensive and have the potential to aerosolize infectious particles. Composting, on the other hand, has been recognized as a biosecure disposal method. Research showed that it eliminates bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157: H7, Salmonella spp., as well as viruses including highly pathogenic avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, Newcastle disease, and porcine epidemic diarrhea. This paper summarizes the lessons learned during the major animal disease outbreaks including the 2010 foot-and-mouth disease, 2016 highly pathogenic avian influenza, and recent African swine fever outbreaks.

However, emerging health issues of eastern white pine have increased dramatically in recent decades, raising serious concerns over the health and future of this species. These emerging issues are due to native pests and pathogens that were mostly innocuous in the past and hence, have been rarely studied. One fungal pathogen of concern, Caliciopsis pinea Peck, is associated with severe resinosis, crown thinning, dieback, cankers, and bark cracks/fissures. Reports of C. pinea have been on the rise since the mid-1990s, particularly in the northeastern U.S. An insect of concern, eastern white pine bast scale (Matsucoccus macrocicatrices Richards), is a sap-sucking pest associated with branch flagging, dieback, and canker formation. Although described as early as 1958, this insect was not reported in the southeastern U.S. until 2006, when it was found on eastern white pine with dieback symptoms. A foliar complex of fungal pathogens has also been on the rise since 2006 in the northeastern U.S. and southern Canada, known collectively as White Pine Needle Damage. This complex results in needle discoloration and necrosis, premature needle drop, and branch dieback. In combination, these emerging health issues are occurring at levels not previously reported and across several regions, indicating an imminent range-wide health concern for eastern white pine. Our goal is to synthesize the ecology, evolutionary and post-settlement history, silvicultural practices, and abiotic and biotic stressors of eastern white pine.

Biomes whose extents are limited by temperature or precipitation, such as the tundra and savanna, may be particularly strongly affected by climate change. While woody plant encroachment is prevalent across both biomes, its relationship to temperature and precipitation change remains unknown. Here, we quantify the degree to which woody encroachment is related to climate change and identify its main associated drivers. Location Tundra and savanna biomes. Time period 1992 +/- 20.27-2010 +/- 5.62 (mean +/- SD). 1876-2016 (range). Major taxa studied Woody plants (shrubs and trees). Methods We compiled a dataset comprising 1,089 records from 899 sites of woody plant cover over time and attributed drivers of woody cover change across these two biomes. We calculated cover change in each biome and assessed the degree to which cover change corresponds to concurrent temperature and precipitation changes using multiple climate metrics. Finally, we conducted a quantitative literature review of the relative importance of attributed drivers of woody cover change. Results Woody encroachment was widespread geographically and across climate gradients. Rates of woody cover change (positive or negative) were 1.8 times lower in the tundra than in the savanna (1.8 vs. 3.2%), while rates of woody cover increase (i.e., encroachment) were c. 1.7 times lower in the tundra compared with the savanna (3.7 vs. 6.3% per decade). In the tundra, magnitudes of woody cover change did not correspond to climate, while in the savanna, greater cover change corresponded with increases in precipitation. We found higher rates of woody cover change in wetter versus drier sites with warming in the tundra biome, and higher rates of woody cover change in drier versus wetter sites with increasing precipitation in the savanna. However, faster rates of woody cover change were not associated with more rapid rates of climate change across sites, except for maximum precipitation in the savanna. Main conclusions Woody encroachment was positively related to warming in the tundra and increased rainfall in the savanna. However, cover change rates were not predicted by rates of climate change, which can be partially explained by climate interactions in both biomes. Additional likely influences include site-level factors, time-lags, plant-specific responses, and land use and other non-climate drivers.

E.; Welty, J.; Mayer, K. E.","Fire regimes in sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems have been greatly altered across the western United States. Broad-scale invasion of non-native annual grasses, climate change, and human activities have accelerated wildfire cycles, increased fire size and severity, and lengthened fire seasons in many sagebrush ecosystems to the point that current wildfire-management practices and postfire restoration efforts cannot keep pace to ameliorate the ecological consequences of sagebrush ecosystem loss. The greatest impact of uncharacteristically frequent fire is the transition from native sagebrush-perennial grass communities to invasive, non-native, annual grasslands that are highly flammable. These community transitions are often permanent, owing to the low probability of reestablishing native perennial plants in non-native annual grass -dominated communities. Moreover, these grasses can form extensive and continuous fine fuel loads that promote more frequent fire and the continued expansion of invasive, non-native annuals. More frequent, larger, and severe wildfires necessitate greater resources for fire-prevention, fire-suppression, and postfire restoration activities, while decreasing critical ecosystem services, economic and recreational opportunities, and cultural traditions. Increased flexibility and better prioritization of management activities based on ecological needs, including commitment to long-term prefire and postfire management, are needed to achieve notable reductions in uncharacteristic wildfire activity and associated negative impacts. Collaboration and partnerships across jurisdictional boundaries, agencies, and disciplines can improve consistency in sagebrush-management approaches and thereby contribute to this effort. Here, we provide a synthesis on sagebrush wildfire trends and the impacts of uncharacteristic fire regimes on sage-brush plant communities, dependent wildlife species, fire-suppression costs, and ecosystem services.

Changes are already ongoing in Arctic systems, but there is a lack of coordinated monitoring of Arctic freshwaters that hinders our ability to assess changes in biodiversity. To address the need for coordinated monitoring on a circumpolar scale, the Arctic Council working group, Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna, established the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program, which is an adaptive monitoring program for the Arctic centred around four ecosystem themes (i.e., Freshwater, Terrestrial, Coastal, Marine). The freshwater theme developed a monitoring plan for Arctic freshwater biodiversity and recently completed the first assessment of status and trends in Arctic freshwater biodiversity. Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program-Freshwater has compiled and analysed a database of Arctic freshwater monitoring data to form the first report of the state of circumpolar Arctic freshwater biodiversity. This special issue presents the scientific analyses that underlie the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program-Freshwater report and provides analyses of spatial and temporal diversity patterns and the multiple-stressor scenarios that act on the biological assemblages and biogeochemistry of Arctic lakes and rivers. This special issue includes regional patterns for selected groups of organisms in Arctic rivers and lakes of northern Europe, Russia, and North America. Circumpolar assessments for benthic diatoms, macrophytes, plankton, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish demonstrate how climate change and associated environmental drivers affect freshwater biodiversity. Also included are papers on spatial and temporal trends in water chemistry across the circumpolar region, and a systematic review of documented Indigenous Knowledge that demonstrates its potential to support assessment and conservation of Arctic freshwaters. This special issue includes the first circumpolar assessment of trends in Arctic freshwater biodiversity and provides important baseline information for future assessments and studies. It represents the largest compilation and assessment of Arctic freshwater biodiversity data to date and strives to provide a holistic view of ongoing change in these ecosystems to support future monitoring efforts. By identifying gaps in monitoring data across the circumpolar region, as well as identifying best practices for monitoring and assessment, this special issue presents an important resource for researchers, policy makers, and Indigenous and local communities that can support future assessments of ecosystem change.",2022,"JAN","Freshwater Biology","67","1","1-13","WOS:000705837800001","10.1111/fwb.13831","","#2598","Culp 2022","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Hematophagous arthropods can be vectors of infectious and potentially lethal pathogens and parasites, thus constituting a growing threat to humans-especially when associated with biological invasions. Today, several major vector-borne diseases, currently described as emerging or re-emerging, are expanding in a world dominated by climate change, land-use change and intensive transportation of humans and goods. In this review, we retrace the historical trajectory of these invasions to better understand their ecological, physiological and genetic drivers and their impacts on ecosystems and human health. We also discuss arthropod management strategies to mitigate future risks by harnessing ecology, public health, economics and social-ethnological considerations. Trade and transport of goods and materials, including vertebrate introductions and worn tires, have historically been important introduction pathways for the most prominent invasive hematophagous arthropods, but sources and pathways are likely to diversify with future globalization. Burgeoning urbanization, climate change and the urban heat island effect are likely to interact to favor invasive hematophagous arthropods and the diseases they can vector. To mitigate future invasions of hematophagous arthropods and novel disease outbreaks, stronger preventative monitoring and transboundary surveillance measures are urgently required. Proactive approaches, such as the use of monitoring and increased engagement in citizen science, would reduce epidemiological and ecological risks and could save millions of lives and billions of dollars spent on arthropod control and disease management. Last, our capacities to manage invasive hematophagous arthropods in a sustainable way for worldwide ecosystems can be improved by promoting interactions among experts of the health sector, stakeholders in environmental issues and policymakers (e.g. the One Health approach) while considering wider social perceptions.",2023,"AUG 17","PARASITES & VECTORS","16","1","","WOS:001050459900001","10.1186/s13071-023-05887-x","","#2617","Cuthbert 2023","","Biotic; Intervention",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

T.","Many arid grasslands around the world are affected by woody plant encroachment and by the replacement of a relatively continuous grass cover with shrub patches bordered by bare soil. This shift in plant community composition is often abrupt in space and time, suggesting that it is likely sustained by positive feedbacks between vegetation and environmental conditions (e.g. resource availability) or disturbance regime (e.g. fire or freeze). These feedbacks amplify the effects of drivers of shrub encroachment, i.e. of conditions favouring a shift from grass to shrub dominance (e.g. overgrazing, climate change). Here, we review some major drivers and feedbacks and identify the basic stages in the transition from grassland to shrubland. We discuss some possible scenarios of interactions between drivers and feedbacks that could explain the transition from a stage to the next and the potential irreversibility of the shift from grass to shrub dominance. We introduce a simplistic modelling framework that can integrate the various drivers to explain the emergence of bistability for shrub-encroached grassland systems. Published 2011.

S.","The current effects of global warming on marine ecosystems are predicted to increase, with species responding by changing their spatial distributions. Marine ectotherms such as fish experience elevated distribution shifts, as temperature plays a key role in physiological functions and delineating population ranges through thermal constraints. Distributional response predictions necessary for population management have been complicated by high heterogeneity in magnitude and direction of movements, which may be explained by both biological as well as methodological study differences. To date, however, there has been no comprehensive synthesis of the interacting ecological factors influencing fish distributions in response to climate change and the confounding methodological factors that can affect their estimation. In this study we analyzed published studies meeting criteria of reporting range shift responses to global warming in 115 taxa spanning all major oceanic regions, totaling 595 three-dimensional population responses (latitudinal, longitudinal, and depth), with temperature identified as a significant driver. We found that latitudinal shifts were the fastest in non-exploited, tropical populations, and inversely correlated with depth shifts which, in turn, dominated at the trailing edges of population ranges. While poleward responses increased with rate of temperature change and latitude, niche was a key factor in predicting both depth (18% of variation) and latitudinal responses (13%), with methodological predictors explaining between 10% and 28% of the observed variance in marine fish responses to temperature change.

Monitoring of these ecotones is important in light of the potential for change. Equally important is an understanding of past changes so that future changes and their impacts can be forecast. This paper provides an overview of methods that have been used to detect and measure change at forest-tundra ecotones worldwide, with examples drawn from studies of treelines in alpine areas of the subarctic. These methods include resurveys of field plots and transects, repeat photography, dendrochronology, use of historical records, remote sensing, and paleoecological techniques such as palynology and subfossil analysis. The benefits and limitations of each approach are identified and evaluated. It is shown that there is no single best method, largely because each is only capable of resolving change within a specific range of temporal and spatial extents.

However, climate change research in this region is sparse compared to other biomes, hindering conservation efforts. In this article, we review and synthesize the available literature to understand the observed and potential impacts of climate change on different species and ecosystems in the Arctic marine region. We reviewed 253 articles reporting changes in species and ecosystems in the Arctic marine region in response to climate change (225 studies documenting observed impacts and 28 reporting predicted impacts). The review revealed that most research effort has been concentrated in only a subset of Arctic Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) (5/18 LMEs), with the majority of Arctic LMEs being poorly studied. The majority of the reviewed papers focused on marine mammals (19%) followed by microalgae (17%). A number of studies documented variability in planktonic communities (microalgae, macroalgae, zooplankton), resulting in alteration in ecosystem structure and function. Reproductive failure, decline in populations, and changes in diet composition, behavior, and breeding biology were reported for sea birds and mammals. Further, shifts in spatial distribution of fishes were observed by several studies. This review provides persuasive evidence that multiple climate change indices in the Arctic region are changing, with impacts on almost all components of marine biotic ecosystems (from plankton to top predators). We identify a number of gaps (such as limited inventory of biota, robustness of data supporting climate change indices on an Arctic Ocean scale, and climate suitability assessment for all species) in climate change research in Arctic marine ecosystems where future studies can help to quantify the impacts of climate change on species and ecosystems and advance understanding for their adaptive management.",2023,"SEP","Environmental Reviews","31","3","403-451","WOS:000963001200001","10.1139/er-2022-0101","","#2881","Deb 2023","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-19 04:28:12)(Select): This definitely relates to biodiversity + climate change.

Declines can occur simultaneously at both large and small regional scales rendering factors driving the decreases more elusive. On the south coast of Newfoundland abundance of Atlantic salmon at Conne River fell by 92% over a period of almost four decades in contrast with most other populations in the region suggesting local factors may be contributing to the decline. Here factors potentially contributing to the long-term decline of salmon are reviewed by (1) examining long-term trends in abundance and survival at different life stages, (2) presenting a synopsis on the presence and absence of factors impacting survival and productivity of this population, (3) using a semi-quantitative two dimensional classification system, based on expert opinion, to rank factors potentially contributing to the decline, and (4) utilizing a quantitative Random Forest analysis to complement the expert opinion approach in identifying factors possibly affecting salmon abundance in this south coast Newfoundland population. Results from both qualitative and quantitative analyses identified factors associated with salmon aquaculture as a possible driver of the decline. Additional factors include the influence of both climate change and predation in freshwater and marine habitats.

M.; Meiswinkel, R.","Vector-borne animal diseases pose a continuous and substantial threat to livestock economies around the globe. Increasing international travel, the globalisation of trade, and climate change are likely to play a progressively more important role in the introduction, establishment and spread of arthropod-borne pathogens worldwide. A review of the literature reveals that many climatic variables, functioning singly or in combination, exert varying effects on the distribution and range of Culicoides vector midges and mosquitoes. For example, higher temperatures may be associated with increased insect abundance thereby amplifying the risk of disease transmission but there are no indications yet of dramatic shifts occurring in the geographic range of Culicoides midges. However, the same cannot be said for mosquitoes: over the last few decades, multiple Asian species have established themselves in Europe, spread and are unlikely to ever be eradicated. Research on how insects respond to changes in climate is still in its infancy. The authors argue that we need to grasp how other annectant changes, such as extremes in precipitation (drought and flooding), may affect the dispersal capability of mosquitoes. Models are useful for assessing the interplay between mosquito vectors expanding their range and the native flora and fauna; however, ecological studies employing classical mark-release-recapture techniques remain essential for addressing fundamental questions about the survival and dispersal of mosquito species, with the resulting parameters fed directly into new-generation disease transmission models.

D.; Dalby, L.","The term 'short-stopping' is increasingly used in ecology to describe spatio-temporal changes in occurrence of migratory species. Spurred by the insight that it has been used in a variety of contexts, we reviewed its use in avian ecology. A literature search yielded 59 papers explicitly treating short-stopping in birds, most of them in peer-reviewed journals. The term was first used in 1967 to describe a northward shift in wintering Canada Geese in North America and has been used with increasing frequency to the present day. Geese dominate the short-stopping literature, which is confined to the northern hemisphere. Short-stopping has been used to describe (1) a shortened autumn migration that results in a wintering distribution closer to breeding areas, (2) a shortened spring migration that results in a breeding distribution closer to wintering areas, and (3) a delay in autumn migration that leads to a perceived reduced abundance in some part of the winter range. We advocate that short-stopping should be used only to describe (1) range shifts that involve shortening of the migratory corridor, and that they are qualified explicitly by season (i.e. breeding/winter) and degree (i.e. full or partial range shift). In other cases of breeding, wintering or entire range shifts where the migratory corridor is elongated or remains the same, we recommend using the term 'range shift', qualified by season, geography and orientation (i.e. the direction of the range shift).

The adoption of an evolutionary ecology framework aimed to diminish the impact of tick-borne diseases needs to be part of strategies to protect human and animal populations. We present a review of current knowledge on the adaptation of ticks to their environment, and the impact that global change could have on their geographic distribution in North America. Environmental pressures will affect tick population genetics by selecting genotypes able to withstand new and changing environments and by altering the connectivity and isolation of several tick populations. Research in these areas is particularly lacking in the southern United States and most of Mexico with knowledge gaps on the ecology of these diseases, including a void in the identity of reservoir hosts for several tick-borne pathogens. Additionally, the way in which anthropogenic changes to landscapes may influence tick-borne disease ecology remains to be fully understood. Enhanced knowledge in these areas is needed in order to implement effective and sustainable integrated tick management strategies. We propose to refocus ecology studies with emphasis on metacommunity-based approaches to enable a holistic perspective addressing whole pathogen and host assemblages. Network analyses could be used to develop mechanistic models involving multihost-pathogen communities.

A.; Navarrete, I.; McEwan, M. A.; Garrett, K. A.","Disaster plant pathology addresses how natural and human-driven disasters impact plant diseases and the requirements for smart management solutions. Local to global drivers of plant disease change in response to disasters, often creating environments more conducive to plant disease. Most disasters have indirect effects on plant health through factors such as disrupted supply chains and damaged infrastructure. There is also the potential for direct effects from disasters, such as pathogen or vector dispersal due to floods, hurricanes, and human migration driven by war. Pulse stressors such as hurricanes and war require rapid responses, whereas press stressors such as climate change leave more time for management adaptation but may ultimately cause broader challenges. Smart solutions for the effects of disasters can be deployed through digital agriculture and decision support systems supporting disaster preparedness and optimized humanitarian aid across scales. Here, we use the disaster plant pathology framework to synthesize the effects of disasters in plant pathology and outline solutions to maintain food security and plant health in catastrophic scenarios. We recommend actions for improving food security before and following disasters, including (i) strengthening regional and global cooperation, (ii) capacity building for rapid implementation of new technologies, (iii) effective clean seed systems that can act quickly to replace seed lost in disasters, (iv) resilient biosecurity infrastructure and risk assessment ready for rapid implementation, and (v) decision support systems that can adapt rapidly to unexpected scenarios.Copyright (c) 2024 The Author(s).

(2) Population limitation and regulation includes both seasonal and between-season interactions. (3) The study of movements of small-bodied species remains a major research frontier. (4) We must increase our understanding of population connectivity. (5) With few exceptions, population regulation has barely been investigated.

Bats are a species-rich, globally distributed group of organisms that are thought to be particularly sensitive to the effects of climate change because of their high surface-to-volume ratios and low reproductive rates. We systematically reviewed the literature on bat responses to climate change to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge, identify research gaps and biases and highlight future research needs. We found that studies are geographically biased towards Europe, North America and Australia, and temperate and Mediterranean biomes, thus missing a substantial proportion of bat diversity and thermal responses. Less than half of the published studies provide concrete evidence for bat responses to climate change. For over a third of studied bat species, response evidence is only based on predictive species distribution models. Consequently, the most frequently reported responses involve range shifts (57% of species) and changes in patterns of species diversity (26%). Bats showed a variety of responses, including both positive (e.g. range expansion and population increase) and negative responses (range contraction and population decrease), although responses to extreme events were always negative or neutral. Spatial responses varied in their outcome and across families, with almost all taxonomic groups featuring both range expansions and contractions, while demographic responses were strongly biased towards negative outcomes, particularly among Pteropodidae and Molossidae. The commonly used correlative modelling approaches can be applied to many species, but do not provide mechanistic insight into behavioural, physiological, phenological or genetic responses. There was a paucity of experimental studies (26%), and only a small proportion of the 396 bat species covered in the examined studies were studied using long-term and/or experimental approaches (11%), even though they are more informative about the effects of climate change. We emphasise the need for more empirical studies to unravel the multifaceted nature of bats' responses to climate change and the need for standardised study designs that will enable synthesis and meta-analysis of the literature. Finally, we stress the importance of overcoming geographic and taxonomic disparities through strengthening research capacity in the Global South to provide a more comprehensive view of terrestrial biodiversity responses to climate change.",2023,"FEB","Biological Reviews","98","1","19-33","WOS:000842446000001","10.1111/brv.12893","","#3734","Festa 2023","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"62","Disturbances in deciduous temperate forest ecosystems of the northern hemisphere: their effects on both recent and future forest development","Fischer, A.; Marshall, P.; Camp, A.","Disturbances in forests can kill mature trees, but also create the conditions necessary for the establishment of new tree cohorts and create micro-habitats for new plant and animal species, thereby increasing the species diversity compared to undisturbed stands. We review the types and intensities of disturbances on forests in three regions of the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere: northeastern North America, Central Europe, and East Asia. We focus on (1) the ways in which disturbances affect forest stand development; (2) the differences among the three areas in this regard; (3) the consequences for future forest management. In both northeastern North America and East Asia, hurricanes and typhoons represent the major mode of natural disturbance, while in Central Europe winter windstorms occur after deciduous trees have lost their leaves. Tornadoes can have even greater destructive power (but affect relatively narrow strips of land), and the more severe of these mainly occur in North America. The general disturbance patch system therefore is relatively large in northeastern North America, small in Central Europe, and of intermediate size in temperate East Asia. In addition to wholly natural disturbance factors, human commerce and globalization have enabled new disturbance types by introducing pests and diseases from one region to another. In North America especially, several of the most important foundation species in temperate forests are strongly affected, so that not just the species composition but also the whole forest structure is changing fundamentally. In all three areas in the past the change in land use by growing human populations strongly affected the structure as well as the species composition of forests. Nearly all the recent forest stands of the temperate zone had been used in the past in a particular way, and many of today's forests had previously been converted into agricultural land. Finally climate change is superimposing itself on forest development worldwide. Nevertheless, climate change is not a new phenomenon, so forest ecosystems in all time periods have been exposed to changing climatic conditions and have had to adapt.

Because of a coincidence of high species richness and human presence, Mediterranean biodiversity is particularly threatened by processes such as habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss, pollution, climate change and introduction of invasive species. Invasive tree pathogens are among the problematic exotic species of California, Chile, the Mediterranean, South Africa and Australia. In this review, we provide an update on a selection of non-native tree pathogens currently posing a threat in Mediterranean ecosystems. The impact of exotic forest pathogens range from large-scale tree and shrub mortality in native ecosystems (Phytophthora ramorum on the West Coast of the USA) to disruption of plantations of exotic (e.g., Seiridium cardinale on planted Monterey cypress in California, Fusarium circinatum on Monterey pine worldwide) and native trees (introduction of the North American Heterobasidion irregulare in stone pine woodland in Italy). Genetic analyses are instrumental in improving our understanding and management of these outbreaks. There is a need for more empirical data on how novel pathosystems are likely to develop under novel climates, as well as interdisciplinary collaborations among forest pathologists, theoretical modellers and climatologists. The magnitude of the observed effects of some exotic tree diseases makes it important to try and minimize the risk of the inadvertent movement of plant pathogens when planning assisted migration activities to enable plant species to cope with rapid climate change.",2012,"MAY","European Journal of Plant Pathology","133","1","101-116","WOS:000302232600007","10.1007/s10658-011-9928-6","","#4078","Garbelotto 2012","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

A.","Arctic regions are ecologically significant for the environmental persistence and geographic dissemination of influenza A viruses (IAVs) by avian hosts and other wildlife species. Data describing the epidemiology and ecology of IAVs among wildlife in the arctic are less frequently published compared to southern temperate regions, where prevalence and subtype diversity are more routinely documented. Following PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review addresses this gap by describing the prevalence, spatiotemporal distribution, and ecological characteristics of IAVs detected among wildlife and the environment in this understudied region of the globe. The literature search was performed in PubMed and Google Scholar using a set of pre-defined search terms to identify publications reporting on IAVs in Arctic regions between 1978 and February 2022. A total of 2125 articles were initially screened, 267 were assessed for eligibility, and 71 articles met inclusion criteria. IAVs have been detected in multiple wildlife species in all Arctic regions, including seabirds, shorebirds, waterfowl, seals, sea lions, whales, and terrestrial mammals, and in the environment. Isolates from wild birds comprise the majority of documented viruses derived from wildlife; however, among all animals and environmental matrices, 26 unique low and highly pathogenic subtypes have been characterized in the scientific literature from Arctic regions. Pooled prevalence across studies indicates 4.23% for wild birds, 3.42% among tested environmental matrices, and seroprevalences of 9.29% and 1.69% among marine and terrestrial mammals, respectively. Surveillance data are geographically biased, with most data from the Alaskan Arctic and many fewer reports from the Russian, Canadian, North Atlantic, and Western European Arctic. We highlight multiple important aspects of wildlife host, pathogen, and environmental ecology of IAVs in Arctic regions, including the role of avian migration and breeding cycles for the global spread of IAVs, evidence of inter-species and inter-continental reassortment at high latitudes, and how climate change-driven ecosystem shifts, including changes in the seasonal availability and distribution of dietary resources, have the potential to alter host-pathogen-environment dynamics in Arctic regions.

F.; Reed, A.; Béchet, A.; Bélanger, L.","The North American greater snow goose population has increased dramatically during the last 40 years. We evaluated whether refuge creation, changes in land use on the wintering and staging grounds, and climate warming have contributed to this expansion by affecting the distribution, habitat use, body condition, and migration phenology of birds. We also reviewed the effects of the increasing population on marshes on the wintering grounds, along the migratory routes and on the tundra in summer. Refuges established before 1970 may have contributed to the initial demographic increase. The most important change, however, was the switch from a diet entirely based on marsh plants in spring and winter (rhizomes of Scirpus/Spartina) to one dominated by crops (corn/young grass shoots) during the 1970s and 1980s. Geese now winter further north along the US Atlantic coast, leading to reduced hunting mortality. Their migratory routes now include portions of southwestern Quebec where corn production has increased exponentially. Since the mid-1960s, average temperatures have increased by 1-2.4 degrees C throughout the geographic range of geese, which may have contributed to the northward shift in wintering range and an earlier migration in spring. Access to spilled corn in spring improved fat reserves upon departure for the Arctic and may have contributed to a high fecundity. The population increase has led to intense grazing of natural wetlands used by geese although these habitats are still largely undamaged. The foraging in fields allowed the population to exceed limits imposed by natural marshes in winter and spring, but also prevented permanent damage because of their overgrazing.",2005,"JUN","Global Change Biology","11","6","856-868","WOS:000229427600002","10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.00944.x","","#4141","Gauthier 2005","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-27 06:27:22)(Select): Def relevant!

However, empirical evidence remains scarce and poorly synthesized at scales necessary for effective management. We conducted a literature synthesis to assess the state of research on the observed and predicted effects of climate change on a suite of 398 aquatic and terrestrial NIS now present in or a major threat to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest (PNW), USA and British Columbia. Surprisingly, very few studies (n = 15) have investigated the observed effects of climate change on the distribution, abundance, spread, or impact of the focal NIS, with only five studies focusing on terrestrial (n = 2) or aquatic (n = 3) species within the PNW. Only 93 studies predicted the future dynamics of the focal NIS somewhere in their non-native range using climate model projections, yielding 117 species-specific predictions. However, only 30 of those studies generated predictions that overlapped with the PNW, and only six focused specifically on the expansion or abundance of NIS (n = 11 species) entirely within the region. Although our understanding of how climate change may interact with biological invasions is notably lacking, some evidence suggests that climate-induced NIS expansions are already underway in the PNW, particularly in aquatic ecosystems, and will be exacerbated by future changes in temperature and precipitation regimes.

The expansions of Pseudacteon populations have been systematically and widely monitored. Before 2002, the widely released initial species P. tricuspis Borgmeier did not become established. Severe drought in 1996-2001 and host-size-dependent sex ratio were proposed constraints in establishing this species. In recent years, however, these limitations have been lifted in some areas by favorable weather, irrigation of release sites, and/or by use of a smaller Pseudacteon species, P. curvatus Borgmeier, not reliant on larger fire ant workers to produce females. Beginning in 2002, the USDA-APHIS collaboration with USDA-ARS and Texas Cooperative Extension programs began to supplement release sites in Texas beyond those initiated by the University of Texas, Austin phorid fly project.

At local and regional scales, other local human stressors (LS) can interact with CC and modify its effects on marine ecosystems. Understanding the response of the marine environment to the combined effects of CC and LS is crucial to inform marine ecosystem-based management and planning, yet our knowledge of the potential effects of such interactions is fragmented. At a global scale, we explored how cumulative effect assessments (CEAs) have addressed CC in the marine realm and discuss progress and shortcomings of current approaches. For this we conducted a systematic review on how CEAs investigated at different levels of biological organization ecological responses, functional aspects, and the combined effect of CC and HS. Globally, the effects of 52 LS and of 27 CC-related stressors on the marine environment have been studied in combination, such as industrial fisheries with change in temperature, or sea level rise with artisanal fisheries, marine litter, change in sediment load and introduced alien species. CC generally intensified the effects of LS at species level. At trophic groups and ecosystem levels, the effects of CC either intensified or mitigated the effects of other HS depending on the trophic groups or the environmental conditions involved, thus suggesting that the combined effects of CC and LS are context-dependent and vary among and within ecosystems. Our results highlight that large-scale assessments on the spatial interaction and combined effects of CC and LS remain limited. More importantly, our results strengthen the urgent need of CEAs to capture local-scale effects of stressors that can exacerbate climate-induced changes. Ultimately, this will allow identifying management measures that aid counteracting CC effects at relevant scales. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Climate warming and subsequent landscape transformations result in rapid ecological change in Arctic freshwaters. Here we provide a synthesis of the diversity of benthic diatoms, plankton, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates, and fish in Arctic freshwaters. 2. We developed a multi-organism measure of alpha diversity to characterise circumpolar spatial patterns and their environmental correlates, and we assessed ecoregion-level beta diversity for all organism groups across the Arctic. 3. Alpha diversity was lowest at high latitudes and elevations and where dispersal barriers exist. Diversity was positively related to temperature, and both temperature and connectivity limited diversity on high latitude islands. Beta diversity was highly variable among ecoregions for most organism groups, ranging from 0 (complete similarity) to 1 (complete dissimilarity). The high degree of dissimilarity within many ecoregions illustrates the uniqueness of many Arctic freshwater communities. 4. Northward range expansion of freshwater taxa into Arctic regions may lead to increased competition for cold-stenothermic and cold-adapted species, and ultimately lead to the extinction of unique Arctic species. Societal responses to predicted impacts include: (1) actions to improve detection of changes (e.g., harmonised monitoring, remote sensing) and engagement with Arctic residents and Indigenous Peoples; and (2) actions to reduce the impact of unwanted changes (e.g., reductions of CO2 emissions, action against the spread of invasive species). 5.

Quantifying the complex spatial dynamics taking place at range edges is critical for understanding future distributions of species, yet very few systems have sufficient data or the spatial resolution to empirically test these dynamics. This paper reviews how data from a large-scale pest management programme have provided important contributions to the fields of population dynamics and invasion biology. 2. The invasion of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) is well-documented from its introduction near Boston, Massachusetts USA in 1869 to its current extent of over 900,000 km(2) in Eastern North America. Over the past two decades, the USDA Forest Service Slow the Spread (STS) programme for managing the future spread of gypsy moth has produced unrivalled spatiotemporal data across the invasion front. 3. The STS programme annually deploys a grid of 60,000-100,000 pheromone-baited traps, currently extending from Minnesota to North Carolina. The data from this programme have provided the foundation for investigations of complex population dynamics and the ability to examine ecological hypotheses previously untestable outside of theoretical venues, particularly regarding invasive spread and Allee effects. 4. This system provides empirical data on the importance of long-distance dispersal and time-lags on population establishment and spatial spread. Studies showing high rates of spatiotemporal variation of the range edge, from rapid spread to border stasis and even retraction, highlight future opportunities to test mechanisms that influence both invasive and native species ranges. 5. The STS trap data have also created a unique opportunity to study low-density population dynamics and quantify Allee effects with empirical data.

A.; Fallon, C. E.; Blevins, E.; Kai, T. Y. R.; Muhlfeld, C. C.; Finn, D. S.; Hotaling, S.","Rapid recession of glaciers and snowfields is threatening the habitats of cold-water biodiversity worldwide. In many ice-sourced headwaters of western North America, stoneflies in the genus Lednia (Plecoptera: Nemouridae) are a prominent member of the invertebrate community. With a broad distribution in mountain streams and close ties to declining glacier cover, Lednia has emerged as a sentinel of climate change threats to high-elevation aquatic biodiversity. Lednia tumana, which is endemic to Glacier National Park, USA and the surrounding mountains, is the most well-studied species in the genus and in 2019 became federally protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) due to climate-induced loss of meltwater habitats. Three other Lednia species have also been described, and like L. tumana, each is endemic to a mountain region of western North America: Lednia sierra in the Sierra Nevada, Lednia borealis in the Cascade Range, and Lednia tetonica in the Teton Range. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of Lednia ecology, genetics, and physiology, with an emphasis on the conservation outlook for the group and species with similar headwater distributions. We highlight substantial progress made in the last decade to better understand the ecology and evolution of Lednia, including the identification of 140 Lednia-containing streams (an increase from 12 streams in 2010), and a more complete understanding of the degree to which warming streams may imperil species in the genus. In light of the ESA listing of L. tumana, we show that similar conservation threats likely face all extant Lednia species. However, substantial gaps in our knowledge remain, primarily centering around their distributions (and the potential for as yet undescribed species), life history, ecophysiology, and trophic ecology. We conclude by describing pressing questions for Lednia that when addressed will expand knowledge of the genus and its conservation as well as broader understanding of climate risks to mountain stream biodiversity worldwide.",2022,"FEB","Biodiversity and Conservation","31","2","353-377","WOS:000740136100001","10.1007/s10531-021-02344-y","","#4505","Green 2022","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

"76","A review of modern treeline migration, the factors controlling it and the implications for carbon storage","Hansson, A.; Dargusch, P.; Shulmeister, J.","Numerous studies have reported that treelines are moving to higher elevations and higher latitudes. Most treelines are temperature limited and warmer climate expands the area in which trees are capable of growing. Hence, climate change has been assumed to be the main driver behind this treeline movement. The latest review of treeline studies was published in 2009 by Harsch et al. Since then, a plethora of papers have been published studying local treeline migration. Here we bring together this knowledge through a review of 142 treeline related publications, including 477 study locations. We summarize the information known about factors limiting tree-growth at and near treelines. Treeline migration is not only dependent on favorable growing conditions but also requires seedling establishment and survival above the current treeline. These conditions appear to have become favorable at many locations, particularly so in recent years. The review revealed that at 66% of these treeline sites forest cover had increased in elevational or latitudinal extent. The physical form of treelines influences how likely they are to migrate and can be used as an indicator when predicting future treeline movements. Our analysis also revealed that while a greater percentage of elevational treelines are moving, the latitudinal treelines are capable of moving at greater horizontal speed. This can potentially have substantial impacts on ecosystem carbon storage. To conclude the review, we present the three main hypotheses as to whether ecosystem carbon budgets will be reduced, increased or remain the same due to treeline migration. While the answer still remains under debate, we believe that all three hypotheses are likely to apply depending on the encroached ecosystem. Concerningly, evidence is emerging on how treeline migration may turn tundra landscapes from net sinks to net sources of carbon dioxide in the future.",2021,"FEB","Journal of Mountain Science","18","2","291-306","WOS:000615794600001","10.1007/s11629-020-6221-1","","#4832","Hansson 2021","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

F.","This synthesis focuses on the estuarine and ocean ecology of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) across their southern ranges in North America. General life history and ecology share many common traits including iteroparity, duration of freshwater (0-3 years) and marine (2-5 years) rearing, ocean emigration at relatively large sizes and strong surface orientation compared to other salmonids. Despite parallels in life history and anthropogenic pressures, several differences emerged for these species. First, steelhead have greater life history diversity and a broader geographic distribution. Generally, estuary habitats serve as short-term migration corridors for both species. However, some steelhead populations used lagoon habitat in south-coast watersheds. While both species are epipelagic, Atlantic salmon exhibit more vertical migration. Atlantic salmon tend to follow migratory highways-relatively narrow bands along the coastal shelf, then crossing the Atlantic to feed inshore and in fjords of West Greenland. Conversely, steelhead exit the coastal shelf quickly, dispersing across the Pacific, and rarely use coastal environments. Despite inhabiting rivers in warm dry Mediterranean climates, the extended range and stability of southern steelhead distribution is likely buffered by cool upwelled waters of the California Current. Whereas Atlantic salmon populations are restricted by warmer Northwest Atlantic circulation patterns lacking cool upwelling with greater susceptibility to warming associated with climate change. Determining the rate of marine habitat changes in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is important to the conservation of these species, including subtleties of temporal and spatial habitat use, and adaptability to ocean ecosystems under climate change.",2014,"SEP","Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries","24","3","757-780","WOS:000340455200006","10.1007/s11160-014-9348-8","","#4954","Hayes 2014","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The results showed that larvae at the northern edge of the latitudinal range of cod depend primarily on development stages of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, whilst those at the southern edge depend on Para- and Pseudocalanus species. Juvenile cod preyed on a wider range of taxa than larvae, but euphausiids were the main target prey. Analysis of regional variations in the relative abundances of C. finmarchicus and Para/Pseudocalanus spp. in the plankton, as estimated by the continuous plankton recorder (CPR) surveys, showed a similar geographical pattern to the larval cod stomach contents. Comparison of CPR data from the 1960s and 70s with data from the 1990s showed that the boundary between C. finmarchicus and Para/Pseudocalanus spp. dominance has shifted northwards on both sides of the Atlantic, whilst the abundance of euphausiids in the southern cod stock regions has declined.

While redistribution may be necessary for species persistence, there can also be impacts on existing communities upon arrival of novel, range-shifting species. Anticipating the beneficial versus deleterious impacts of range-shifting species is essential for determining whether active management is needed, which could include implementation of strategies from facilitation (eg managed relocation) to suppression (eg prevention and control). We used an impact assessment protocol developed for invasive species to evaluate potential consequences of range shifts in coastal marine ecosystems of North America. Our review demonstrates how invasion impact assessment combined with species vulnerability assessment could support decisions about management of range shifts. We found that similar to 50% of these shifting coastal species have had negative impacts in their expanded ranges.

O.","A systematic synthesis of phreatophytes' responses to groundwater drawdown would provide a more complete picture of groundwater-related research aimed at the sustainable management of groundwater-dependent ecosystems amid climate change. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the ecophysiological effects of groundwater drawdown on phreatophytes and methodological approaches were synthesized from peer-reviewed articles published from 1988 to 2022. The highest relative count of studies was found in arid and semi-arid high-income countries, such as Australia and North America (18-24%), while the lowest relative count to no data was found in hyper-arid countries, such as north African countries (0-3.65%). The groundwater depth effects on phreatophyte ecophysiology had the highest relative count (53.65%), followed by large-scale tree plantation effects on the groundwater characteristics (44.37%) and groundwater depth and biological invasion relationship (1.99%). The results revealed that as the groundwater depth increased, the phreatophytic vegetation growth, productivity, and community structure decreased across the ecosystem types. A groundwater withdrawal also had a significant impact on the physiology of the phreatophytes, specifically on the transpiration rate, xylem water potential, hydraulic conductance, and photosynthetic rate. Many of the reviewed studies concluded that large-scale tree plantations can deplete groundwater resources due to an increased evapotranspiration rate. Further, species' diversity, evenness, dominance, composition, and distribution, as well as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), are commonly measured parameters in the reviewed studies through vegetation and groundwater monitoring.

E.","P>The preceding articles in this series review the history, biology and management of white pine blister rust in North America, Europe and eastern Asia. In this integration, we connect and discuss seven recurring themes important for understanding and managing epidemics of Cronartium ribicola in the white pines (five-needle pines in subgenus Strobus). Information and action priorities for research and management of the pathogen, telial and aecial hosts, and their interactions are listed in a detailed Appendix. Syntheses focused on genetics, plant disease, invasive species or forest management have provided alternative but knowledgeable lessons on the white pine blister rust pathosystem. Two critical issues for the conservation of white pines are to sustain ecosystems affected by blister rust and to maintain genetic diversity for adaptive traits such as disease resistance. Forest genetics includes tree improvement and molecular techniques for research; their application can increase rust resistance by artificial and natural selection. Silviculture augments genetics with methods to deploy and enhance resistance as well as to regenerate and tend white pine stands. Although cultivated or wild Ribes might serve as inoculum sources, silviculture and horticulture can reduce the risk of serious impacts from blister rust using genetics for breeding and epidemiology for hazard assessment and disease control. Climate change threatens to cause major alterations in temperature and precipitation regimes, resulting in maladapted conifers succumbing to various diseases and insect outbreaks. In contrast, many white pine species have broad ecological ranges and are tolerant of harsh environments-traits that permit successful establishment and growth over wide geographic and altitudinal zones.

As fire regimes change, it is important to understand how mammals respond to these altered post-fire landscapes. Because fires vary in size, severity and landscape context, it is important to know the experimental designs and response variables used to address post-fire responses of mammals. We analysed 48 papers published from 1988 to 2015 that examined responses of small mammals to natural or prescribed fire in North American conifer forests. These papers used different experimental contrasts (e.g. burned vs unburned sites, time series, within-fire heterogeneity). Most studies (89.6%) presented species richness or index-derived abundances of common species as their response variable(s). Many studies did not fully describe the fires being examined; these omissions make it more difficult to interpret and compare results among studies. The limited scope of inference presented by the papers in this review leads us to recommend a minimal set of information that should be presented about each fire studied.

Much of Canada's policy and rhetoric has not been operationalised, leaving many of the country's national and international obligations unfulfilled in some key areas, such as the establishment of marine protected areas and incorporation of the precautionary approach to fisheries management. We conclude that regulatory conflict within Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) and the absolute discretion exercised by the national Minister of Fisheries and Oceans contribute significantly to an unduly slow rate of policy and statute implementation. We recommend new approaches and measures to sustain Canadian marine biodiversity and new research initiatives to support scientific advice to decision-makers. Many recommendations focus on management actions required to meet existing commitments to biodiversity conservation. Overall, we conclude that the most effective strategy is to protect existing biological diversity and to rebuild depleted populations and species to restore natural diversity.

G.","Monarch butterfly populations in western North America suffered a substantial decline, from millions of butterflies overwintering in California in the 1980s to less than 400,000 at the beginning of the 21st century. The introduction of neonicotinoid insecticides in the mid-1990s and their subsequent widespread use appears to be the most likely major factor behind this sudden decline. Habitat loss and unfavorable climates (high temperatures, aridity, and winter storms) have also played important and ongoing roles. These factors kept overwintering populations stable but below 300,000 during 2001-2017. Late winter storm mortality and consequent poor spring reproduction drove winter populations to less than 30,000 butterflies during 2018-2019. Record high temperatures in California during the fall of 2020 appeared to prematurely terminate monarch migration, resulting in the lowest overwintering population (1899) ever recorded. Many migrants formed winter-breeding populations in urban areas. Normal seasonal temperatures in the autumns of 2021 and 2022 enabled overwintering populations to return to around the 300,000 level, characteristic of the previous two decades. Natural enemies (predators, parasitoids, parasites, and pathogens) may be important regional or local drivers at times but they are a consistent and fundamental part of monarch ecology. Human interference (capture, rearing) likely has the least impact on monarch populations. The rearing of monarch caterpillars, particularly by children, is an important human link to nature that has positive ramifications for insect conservation beyond monarch butterflies and should be encouraged.",2024,"JAN","Insects","15","1","","WOS:001151481800001","10.3390/insects15010040","","#5638","James 2024","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-16 13:25:56)(Select): Monarchs migrate between Mexico and the US.

The North today is in transition, facing increased resource extraction, globalisation of trade and travel, and rapid and accelerating environmental change. This comprehensive review addresses the diversity, distribution, ecology, epidemiology, and significance of nine zoonotic parasites in animal and human populations in the North. Based on a qualitative risk assessment with criteria heavily weighted for human health, these zoonotic parasites are ranked, in the order of decreasing importance, as follows: Echinococcus multilocularis, Toxoplasma gondii, Trichinella and Giardia, Echinococcus granulosus/canadensis and Cryptosporidium, Toxocara, anisakid nematodes, and diphyllobothriid cestodes. Recent and future trends in the importance of these parasites for human health in the North are explored. For example, the incidence of human exposure to endemic helminth zoonoses (e.g. Diphyllobothrium, Trichinella, and Echinococcus) appears to be declining, while water-borne protozoans such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Toxoplasma may be emerging causes of human disease in a warming North. Parasites that undergo temperature-dependent development in the environment (such as Toxoplasma, ascarid and anisakid nematodes, and diphyllobothriid cestodes) will likely undergo accelerated development in endemic areas and temperate-adapted strains/species will move north, resulting in faunal shifts. Food-borne pathogens (e.g. Trichinella, Toxoplasma, anisakid nematodes, and diphyllobothriid cestodes) may be increasingly important as animal products are exported from the North and tourists, workers, and domestic animals enter the North.

Conversely, they are relatively naive to other zoonotic parasites that have previously been unable to establish at northern latitudes. For those parasites that circulate among dogs, wildlife, and people, potential risk factors in the North include limited availability of veterinary services, presence of free-roaming dog populations, and consumption of locally harvested fish and wildlife. These regions are also experiencing some of the greatest impacts of climate change in North America, including increased temperature, precipitation, and frequency and severity of extreme weather. We review the current taxonomy, genetic diversity, host and geographic distributions, epidemiology and risk factors for 3 genera of helminths (Diphyllobothrium spp., Echinococcus spp., and Toxocara sp.) in Canada's North in order to identify climate-sensitive aspects of their ecology. Free-living stages of parasitic zoonoses endemic in the Arctic (such as Diphyllobothrium dendriticum, the cervid strain of Echinococcus granulosus, and Arctic strains of Echinococcus multilocularis) will experience trade-offs between enhanced survival under wetter conditions and increased mortality under warmer conditions. Climate change might also lead to the introduction and establishment in the Arctic of parasitic zoonoses previously restricted to the sub-Arctic, such as Diphyllobothrium latum, Toxocara cants, and the prairie strain of E. multilocularis. Molecular techniques applied in broad geographic surveys are needed to address critical knowledge gaps in the geographic distribution, genetic diversity, and public health significance of zoonotic helminths already in the circumpolar North, and to determine the current barriers to range expansion of temperate-adapted parasites into the North. Dogs will continue to play important roles in the North, including that of a """"bridging"""" host between sylvatic cycles and human communities. In a warming north, increased opportunities for business, agriculture, and tourism favor importation of dogs and their parasites into a newly suitable environment. Collaborations among veterinarians, public health personnel, and policy-makers are needed to enhance surveillance and mitigate for dog-transmitted parasitic zoonoses in a changing North.

The causative agent, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), belongs to the Orbivirus genus and leads to significant regional disease outbreaks among livestock and wildlife in North America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, causing significant morbidity and mortality. During the past decade, this viral disease has become a real threat for countries of the Mediterranean basin, with the recent occurrence of several important outbreaks in livestock. Moreover, the European Union registered the first cases of EHDV ever detected within its territory. Competent vectors involved in viral transmission, Culicoides midges, are expanding its distribution, conceivably due to global climate change. Therefore, livestock and wild ruminants around the globe are at risk for this serious disease.

A.; Jones, V. R.; O'Sullivan, J.; Tucker, G. M.; Newton, I.","An estimated 19% of the world's 9,856 extant bird species are migratory, including some 1,600 species of land- and waterbirds. In 2008, 11% of migratory land- and waterbirds were classed by BirdLife International as threatened or near-threatened on the IUCN Red List. Red List indices show that these migrants have become more threatened since 1988, with 33 species deteriorating and just six improving in status. There is also increasing evidence of regional declines. Population trend data show that more Nearctic-Neotropical migrants have declined than increased in North America since the 1980s, and more Palearctic-Afrotropical migrants breeding in Europe declined than increased during 1970-2000. Reviews of the status of migratory raptors show unfavourable conservation status for 51% of species in the African-Eurasian region (in 2005), and 33% of species in Central, South and East Asia (in 2007). Land-use change owing to agriculture is the most frequently cited threat affecting nearly 80% of all threatened and near-threatened species. However, while agricultural intensification on the breeding grounds is often proposed as the major driver of declines in Palearctic-Afrotropical migrants, some species appear to be limited by the quantity and quality of available habitat in non-breeding areas, notably the drylands of tropical Africa. Forest fragmentation in breeding areas has contributed to the declines of Nearctic-Neotropical migrants with deforestation in non-breeding areas another possible factor. Infrastructure development including wind turbines, cables, towers and masts can also be a threat. Over-harvesting and persecution remain serious threats, particularly at key migration locations. Climate change is affecting birds already, is expected to exacerbate all these pressures, and may also increase competition between migratory and non-migratory species. The conservation of migratory birds thus requires a multitude of approaches. Many migratory birds require effective management of their critical sites, and Important Bird Areas (IBAs) provide an important foundation for such action; however to function effectively in conserving migratory species, IBAs need to be protected and the coherence of the network requires regular review. Since many migratory species (c. 55%) are widely dispersed across their breeding or non-breeding ranges, it is essential to address the human-induced changes at the wider landscape scale, a very considerable challenge. Efforts to conserve migratory birds in one part of the range are less effective if unaddressed threats are reducing these species' populations and habitats elsewhere. International collaboration and coordinated action along migration flyways as a whole are thus key elements in any strategy for the conservation of migratory birds.",2008,"SEP","Bird Conservation International","18","","S49-S73","WOS:000259453100005","10.1017/S0959270908000439","","#6280","Kirby 2008","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

M.","Vector-borne disease incidence and burden are on the rise. Weather events and climate patterns are known to influence vector populations and disease distribution and incidence. Changes in weather trends and climatic factors can shift seasonal vector activity and host behavior, thus altering pathogen distribution and introducing diseases to new geographic regions. With the upward trend in global temperature, changes in the incidence and distribution of disease vectors possibly linked to climate change have been documented. Forecasting and modeling efforts are valuable for incorporating climate into predicting changes in vector and vector-borne disease distribution. These predictions serve to optimize disease outbreak preparedness and response. The purpose of this scoping review was to describe the use of climate data in vector-borne disease prediction in North America between 2000 and 2022. The most investigated diseases were West Nile virus infection, Lyme disease, and dengue. The uneven geographical distribution of publications could suggest regional differences in the availability of surveillance data required for vector-borne disease predictions and forecasts across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Studies incorporated environmental data from ground-based sources, satellite data, previously existing data, and field-collected data. While environmental data such as meteorological and topographic factors were well-represented, further research is warranted to ascertain if relationships with less common variables, such as oceanographic characteristics and drought, hold among various vector populations and throughout wider geographical areas.

Negative correlations between the Den Oever glass eel recruitment index (DOI) and the North Atlantic Oscillation Index since 1938 are discussed, together with older anecdotal evidence. Correlations are established between the DOI and sea surface temperature anomalies at 100-250 in between 1952 and 1995 in the Sargasso Sea/Sub-Tropical Gyre (STG) spawning area. It is hypothesised that, associated with global warming trends, STG warming inhibits spring thermocline mixing and nutrient circulation, with negative impacts on productivity and hence food for leptocephalus larvae. Concurrent gyre spin-up also affects major currents and slowing of oceanic migration has probably enhanced starvation and predation losses. Local factors, such as unfavourable wind-driven currents, can also affect recruitment of glass eels on continental shelves. In contrast, evidence is discussed that indicates fishing mortality and continental climate change appear to have had lesser impacts. Similar starvation-advection explanations for declines in Japanese eel recruitment are proposed. Predictions for the future are made and multidisciplinary and integrated monitoring and research are recommended for managing eel stocks and fisheries. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

L.","Multi-trophic conservation and management strategies may be necessary if reciprocal linkages between primary producers and their consumers are strong. While herbivory on aquatic plants is well-studied, direct top-down control of seagrass populations has received comparatively little attention, particularly in temperate regions. Herein, we used qualitative and meta-analytic approaches to assess the scope and consequences of avian (primarily waterfowl) herbivory on temperate seagrasses of the genus Zostera. Meta-analyses revealed widespread evidence of spatio-temporal correlations between Zostera and waterfowl abundances as well as strong top-down effects of grazing on Zostera. We also documented the identity and diversity of avian species reported to consume Zostera and qualitatively assessed their potential to exert top-down control. Our results demonstrate that Zostera and their avian herbivores are ecologically linked and we suggest that bird herbivory may influence the spatial structure, composition, and functioning of the seagrass ecosystem. Therefore, the consequences of avian herbivory should be considered in the management of seagrass populations. Of particular concern are instances of seagrass overgrazing by waterfowl which result in long-term reductions in seagrass biomass or coverage, with subsequent impacts on local populations of waterfowl and other seagrass-affiliated species. While our results showed that bird density and type may affect the magnitude of the top-down effects of avian herbivory, empirical research on the strength, context-dependency, and indirect effects of waterfowl-Zostera interactions remains limited. For example, increased efforts that explicitly measure the effects of different functional groups of birds on seagrass abundance and/or document how climate change-driven shifts in waterfowl migratory patterns impact seagrass phenology and population structure will advance research programs for both ecologists and managers concerned with the joint conservation of both seagrasses and their avian herbivores.",2017,"DEC 22","Frontiers in Plant Science","8","","","WOS:000418578300001","10.3389/fpls.2017.02119","","#6378","Kollars 2017","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

D.; Navarro, C.; Padolina, C.; Bordacs, S.; Jamnadass, R.; Graudal, L.; Ramamonjisoa, L.","Over the last 200 years, genetic resources of forest trees have been increasingly transferred, within and outside of species' native distribution ranges, for forestry and for research and development (R&D). Transferred germplasm has been deployed to grow trees for numerous purposes, ranging from the production of wood and non-wood products to the provision of ecosystem services such as the restoration of forests for biodiversity conservation. The oldest form of R&D, provenance trials, revealed early on that seed origin has a major influence on the performance of planted trees. International provenance trials have been essential for selecting seed sources for reforestation and for improving tree germplasm through breeding. Many tree breeding programmes were initiated in the 1950s, but as one round of testing and selection typically takes decades, the most advanced of them are only in their third cycle. Recent advances in forest genomics have increased the understanding of the genetic basis of different traits, but it is unlikely that molecular marker-assisted approaches will quickly replace traditional tree breeding methods. Furthermore, provenance trials and progeny tests are still needed to complement new research approaches. Currently, seed of boreal and temperate trees for reforestation purposes are largely obtained from improved sources. The situation is similar for fast growing tropical and subtropical trees grown in plantations, but in the case of tropical hardwoods and many agroforestry trees, only limited tested or improved seed sources are available. Transfers of tree germplasm involve some risks of spreading pests and diseases, of introducing invasive tree species and of polluting the genetic make-up of already present tree populations. Many of these risks have been underestimated in the past, but they are now better understood and managed. Relatively few tree species used for forestry have become invasive, and the risk of spreading pests and diseases while transferring seed is considerably lower than when moving live plants. The implementation of the Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and benefit sharing (ABS) may significantly change current transfer practices in the forestry sector by increasing transaction costs and the time needed to lawfully obtain forest genetic resources for R&D purposes. Many countries are likely to struggle to establish a well-functioning ABS regulatory system, slowing down the process of obtaining the necessary documentation for exchange. This is unfortunate, as climate change, outbreaks of pests and diseases, and continual pressure to support productivity, increase the need for transferring tree germplasm and accelerating R&D.

The warming and resultant longer open water periods suggest a potential for expansion of marine vegetation along the vast Arctic coastline. We compiled and reviewed the scattered time series on Arctic marine vegetation and explored trends for macroalgae and eelgrass (Zostera marina). We identified a total of 38 sites, distributed between Arctic coastal regions in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway/Svalbard, and Russia, having time series extending into the 21st Century. The majority of these exhibited increase in abundance, productivity or species richness, and/or expansion of geographical distribution limits, several time series showed no significant trend. Only four time series displayed a negative trend, largely due to urchin grazing or increased turbidity. Overall, the observations support with medium confidence (i.e., 5-8 in 10 chance of being correct, adopting the IPCC confidence scale) the prediction that macrophytes are expanding in the Arctic. Species distribution modeling was challenged by limited observations and lack of information on substrate, but suggested a current (20002017) potential pan-Arctic macroalgal distribution area of 820.000 km(2) (145.000 km 2 intertidal, 675.000 km(2) subtidal), representing an increase of about 30% for subtidaland 6% for intertidal macroalgae since 1940-1950, and associated polar migration rates averaging 18-23 km decade(-1). Adjusting the potential macroalgal distribution area by the fraction of shores represented by cliffs halves the estimate (412,634 km(2)). Warming and reduced sea ice cover along the Arctic coastlines are expected to stimulate further expansion of marine vegetation from boreal latitudes. The changes likely affect the functioning of coastal Arctic ecosystems because of the vegetation's roles as habitat, and for carbon and nutrient cycling and storage.

I.; Reid, N.","In addition to abiotic determinants, biotic factors, including competitive, interspecific interactions, limit species' distributions. Environmental changes in human disturbance, land use and climate are predicted to have widespread impacts on interactions between species, especially in the order Lagomorpha due to the higher latitudes and more extreme environmental conditions they occupy. We reviewed the published literature on interspecific interactions in the order Lagomorpha and compared the biogeography, macroecology, phylogeny and traits of species known to interact with those of species with no reported interactions, to investigate how projected future environmental change may affect interactions and potentially alter species' distributions. Thirty-three lagomorph species have competitive interactions reported in the literature; the majority involve hares (Lepus sp.) or the eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus). Key regions for interactions are located between 30-50 degrees N of the Equator, and include eastern Asia (southern Russia on the border of Mongolia) and North America (north-western USA). Closely related, large-bodied, similarly sized species occurring in regions of human-modified, typically agricultural landscapes, or at high elevations, are significantly more likely to have reported competitive interactions than other lagomorph species. We identify species' traits associated with competitive interactions, and highlight some potential impacts that future environmental change may have on interspecific interactions. Our approach using bibliometric and biological data is widely applicable, and with relatively straightforward methodologies, can provide insights into interactions between species.

L.; D'Antonio, C. M.; Dudley, T. L.; Fehlberg, S. D.; Gaskin, J. F.; Glenn, E. P.; Hultine, K. R.","Patterns of woody-plant mortality have been linked to global-scale environmental changes, such as extreme drought, heat stress, more frequent and intense fires, and episodic outbreaks of insects and pathogens. Although many studies have focussed on survival and mortality in response to specific physiological stresses, little attention has been paid to the role of genetic heritability of traits and local adaptation in influencing patterns of plant mortality, especially in non-native species. Tamarix spp. is a dominant, non-native riparian tree in western North America that is experiencing dieback in some areas of its range due to episodic herbivory by the recently introduced northern tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda carinulata). We propose that genotype x environment interactions largely underpin current and future patterns of Tamarix mortality. We anticipate that (i) despite its recent introduction, and the potential for significant gene flow, Tamarix in western North America is generally adapted to local environmental conditions across its current range in part due to hybridization of two species; (ii) local adaptation to specific climate, soil and resource availability will yield predictable responses to episodic herbivory; and (iii) the ability to cope with a combination of episodic herbivory and increased aridity associated with climate change will be largely based on functional tradeoffs in resource allocation. This review focusses on the potential heritability of plant carbon allocation patterns in Tamarix, focussing on the relative contribution of acquired carbon to non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools versus other sinks as the basis for surviving episodic disturbance. Where high aridity and/or poor edaphic position lead to chronic stress, NSC pools may fall below a minimum threshold because of an imbalance between the supply of carbon and its demand by various sinks.

M.","Pinus strobiformis (southwestern white pine) is one of the least studied and understood five-needle white pine species in North America. Recently, this species has become increasingly challenged by Cronartium ribicola (white pine blister rust). This review examines literature relevant to P. strobiformis taxonomy, environmental associations, community associations, stand dynamics, and fire and disturbance ecology in order to better inform the management of this understudied species. In its US range, P. strobiformis occurs in central and southern Arizona and New Mexico and western Texas and has been documented as far north as southwestern Colorado. In Mexico, it occurs in northeastern Sonora, western Chihuahua and Durango, northern Zacatecas, southern Coahuila and central Nuevo Leon. Although P. strobiformis is a relatively high-elevation species preferring mesic habitats, it occurs across a variety of aspects, slope positions, and elevations. It rarely dominates forest composition but is most often found in complex species mixtures. While located in mixed-conifer habitats at the northern end of its range, it is associated with more diverse forest communities in the southern part of its range. Studies generally indicate P. strobiformis is a mid-seral species, although its low abundance and broad environmental amplitude complicate classification. Regeneration ecology is poorly understood, but bird and rodent seed dispersal do occur in portions of its range. Historical fire regimes in P. strobiformis mixed-conifer forests in the US were primarily characterized by frequent, low-severity surface fire, with less evidence of mixed- and high-severity fire. In Mexico, low-severity surface fire appears to have been ubiquitous within P. strobiformis habitats, with historical fire regimes still largely intact. Information is limited on the effects of disturbances other than fire. Increased temperatures and drought severity associated with climate change could potentially shrink the distribution of P. strobiformis, while altering its dominance in future forest communities. Future research on the ecology and management of P. strobiformis is necessary to effectively manage this species given climate change and white pine blister rust selection pressure.

M.; Johnson, C. G.; Kurth, K. A.; Carlin, M. A.","Background Climate is an important driver of ungulate life-histories, population dynamics, and migratory behaviors. Climate conditions can directly impact ungulates via changes in the costs of thermoregulation and locomotion, or indirectly, via changes in habitat and forage availability, predation, and species interactions. Many studies have documented the effects of climate variability and climate change on North America's ungulates, recording impacts to population demographics, physiology, foraging behavior, migratory patterns, and more. However, ungulate responses are not uniform and vary by species and geography. Here, we present a systematic map describing the abundance and distribution of evidence on the effects of climate variability and climate change on native ungulates in North America.Methods We searched for all evidence documenting or projecting how climate variability and climate change affect the 15 ungulate species native to the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Greenland. We searched Web of Science, Scopus, and the websites of 62 wildlife management agencies to identify relevant academic and grey literature. We screened English-language documents for inclusion at both the title and abstract and full-text levels. Data from all articles that passed full-text review were extracted and coded in a database. We identified knowledge clusters and gaps related to the species, locations, climate variables, and outcome variables measured in the literature.Review findings We identified a total of 674 relevant articles published from 1947 until September 2020. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus), elk (Cervus canadensis), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were the most frequently studied species. Geographically, more research has been conducted in the western U.S. and western Canada, though a notable concentration of research is also located in the Great Lakes region. Nearly 75% more articles examined the effects of precipitation on ungulates compared to temperature, with variables related to snow being the most commonly measured climate variables. Most studies examined the effects of climate on ungulate population demographics, habitat and forage, and physiology and condition, with far fewer examining the effects on disturbances, migratory behavior, and seasonal range and corridor habitat.Conclusions The effects of climate change, and its interactions with stressors such as land-use change, predation, and disease, is of increasing concern to wildlife managers. With its broad scope, this systematic map can help ungulate managers identify relevant climate impacts and prepare for future changes to the populations they manage. Decisions regarding population control measures, supplemental feeding, translocation, and the application of habitat treatments are just some of the management decisions that can be informed by an improved understanding of climate impacts. This systematic map also identified several gaps in the literature that would benefit from additional research, including climate effects on ungulate migratory patterns, on species that are relatively understudied yet known to be sensitive to changes in climate, such as pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), and on ungulates in the eastern U.S. and Mexico.",2024,"APR 4","Environmental Evidence","13","1","","WOS:001197165300001","10.1186/s13750-024-00331-8","","#7699","Malpeli 2024","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Methods With 181 observations of Larix range limit dynamics, we used five distribution parameters (tree line advance, stand infilling, tree line recession, stand thinning, no response) and their determinants (climate, land use change, natural disturbance) to describe and explain observed patterns of Larix range shifts under contemporary climate change. We ran a redundancy analysis on the matrix of five distribution parameters considered with other climatic and nonclimatic parameters as explanatory variables. We also characterized the climatic niche of Larix species (temperature and precipitation) and how the niche has changed during the 20th century. Results Of 173 sites studied over the full distribution of Larix, 63% experienced Larix population increases, 18% had population decreases, and no response was detected at 19% of sites. Latitudinal Larix tree lines in Siberia and North America appear to be infilling and shifting their distributions northward, whereas Larix recession and thinning was more common in southern regions, suggesting southern populations may be experiencing greater drought stress than their northern counterparts. Climatic niches of most Larix species shifted towards warmer and wetter conditions, with tree line advance/forest infilling in cool/dry climate space, and recession/thinning in warm/dry space. Main conclusions Northern expansion is underway or seems imminent for boreal Larix species, primarily L. laricina in North America. Retraction in southern regions and disappearance of some mountainous populations may be inevitable due to their narrow ecological niches. Species restricted to mountainous habitats may expand locally, though will likely not contribute to broad scale range expansion. These changes will depend on suitable climate, disturbance, and dispersal mechanisms.",2019,"JAN","Journal of Biogeography","46","1","30-44","WOS:000456346000003","10.1111/jbi.13465","","#7705","Mamet 2019","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

N.; Brown, C. W.; Scott, P. A.; Shaffer, H. B.","Accurate status assessments of long-lived, widely distributed taxa depend on the availability of long-term monitoring data from multiple populations. However, monitoring populations across large temporal and spatial scales is often beyond the scope of any one researcher or research group. Consequently, wildlife managers may be tasked with utilizing limited information from different sources to detect range-wide evidence of population declines and their causes. When assessments need to be made under such constraints, the research and management communities must determine how to extrapolate from variable population data to species-level inferences. Here, using three different approaches, we integrate and analyze data from the peer-reviewed literature and government agency reports to inform conservation for northwestern pond turtles (NPT) Actinemys marmorata and southwestern pond turtles (SPT) Actinemys pallida. Both NPT and SPT are long-lived freshwater turtles distributed along the west coast of the United States and Mexico. Conservation concerns exist for both species; however, SPT may face more severe threats and are thought to exist at lower densities throughout their range than NPT. For each species, we ranked the impacts of 13 potential threats, estimated population sizes, and modeled population viability with and without long-term droughts. Our results suggest that predation of hatchlings by invasive predators, such as American bullfrogs Lithobates catesbeianus and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, is a high-ranking threat for NPT and SPT. Southwestern pond turtles may also face more severe impacts associated with natural disasters (droughts, wildfires, and floods) than do NPT. Population size estimates from trapping surveys indicate that SPT have smaller population sizes on average than do NPT (P = 0.0003), suggesting they may be at greater risk of local extirpation. Population viability analysis models revealed that long-term droughts are a key environmental parameter; as the frequency of severe droughts increases with climate change, the likelihood of population recovery decreases, especially when census sizes are low. Given current population trends and vulnerability to natural disasters throughout their range, we suggest that conservation and recovery actions first focus on SPT to prevent further population declines.",2021,"DEC","JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT","12","2","485-501","WOS:000728017600007","10.3996/JFWM-20-094","","#7752","Manzo 2021","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

E.","Warming of the planet has accelerated in recent years and is predicted to continue over the next century. Environmental consequences include increasing water temperatures, and evidence of ecological responses to current warming in marine coastal ecosystems is found in poleward shifts in the geographic range of species as well as changes in the composition of nearshore benthic communities. Most evidence has, however, been obtained from intertidal studies, but similar shifts should be occurring for subtidal communities as well, especially for the ecologically important kelp species that provide both food and shelter to a multitude of organisms. Kelp may be particularly vulnerable to climate change due to their cold-water affinities and limited dispersal ability. A major biogeographic transition occurs along northwest Atlantic shores of Canada between subarctic and boreal zones where major shifts can be seen in the composition of kelp assemblages of Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata, Saccharina longicruris and Saccharina latissima. Here we review the historic and recent distribution and abundance of these species and find no evidence of changes in the past century. However, sparse coverage of data, inconsistent methodology and a lack of adequate time series prevent us from concluding that no changes have occurred, especially with respect to natural variation and anthropogenic alteration. These shortcomings illustrate the need for identifying sentinel species and sites for studies dedicated to the specific questions of climate-induced changes in kelp abundance and distribution. We suggest that a combination of traditional and modern tools (e.g., benthic surveys and climate model forecasting, respectively) offers the best path forward.

Climate-induced changes must be assessed in the context of massive anthropogenic changes in water quantity and quality resulting from altered patterns of land use, water withdrawal, and species invasions; these may dwarf or exacerbate climate-induced changes. Water to meet instream needs is competing with other uses of water, and that competition is likely to be increased by climate change. We review recent predictions of the impacts of climate change on aquatic ecosystems in eight regions of North America. Impacts include warmer temperatures that alter lake mixing regimes and availability of fish habitat; changed magnitude and seasonality of runoff regimes that alter nutrient loading and limit habitat availability at low flow; and loss of prairie pothole wetlands that reduces waterfowl populations. Many of the predicted changes in aquatic ecosystems are a consequence of climatic effects on terrestrial ecosystems; shifts in riparian vegetation and hydrology are particularly critical. We review models that could be used to explore potential effects of climate change on freshwater ecosystems; these include models of instream flow, bioenergetics models, nutrient spiraling models, and models relating riverine food webs to hydrologic regime.

Despite substantial improvement in understanding the species, major questions remain about their recruitment, offshore behaviors, captive rearing, and management. Recently, southern flounder have also been in focus because of substantial synchronous population declines throughout their range with specific concerns that recruitment failure and possibly climate change may be implicated.

"108","Breeding for increased drought tolerance in wheat: a review","Mohammadi, R.","Drought, being a yield-limiting factor, has become a major threat to international food security. It is a complex process, and drought tolerance response is carried out by various genes, transcription factors, microRNAs, hormones, proteins, co-factors, ions and metabolites. This complexity has limited the development of crop cultivars for drought tolerance. Breeding for drought tolerance is further complicated because several types of abiotic stress, such as high temperatures, high irradiance, and nutrient toxicities or deficiencies, can challenge crop plants simultaneously. Although marker-assisted selection is now widely deployed in wheat, it has not contributed significantly to cultivar improvement for adaptation to low-yielding environments, and breeding has relied largely on direct phenotypic selection for improved performance in these difficult environments. Advances in plant breeding to produce improved and higher performing wheat cultivars are key to making dryland food-production systems more efficient and more resistant to pressure from drought, extremes of cold and heat, unpredictable rainfall, and new pests and diseases. For optimal performance, wheat cultivars can be targeted to specific farming systems, depending on local conditions and stresses. Genetic gain in wheat yield potential during the last century has been achieved by plant breeding and is well documented. It has been studied by comparing, in the same field trial, the yield of cultivars characterised by different years of release. Genomic selection (GS) and high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) have attracted the interest of plant breeders, and both approaches promise to revolutionise the prediction of complex traits, including growth, yield and adaptation to stress. This review describes the impact of drought on yield, trends in yield for boosting crop yields to meet the projected demands of rising global population by 2050, and genetic gain achieved by plant breeding in the last decades; and gathers known functional information on the genes, metabolites and traits and their direct involvement in conferring drought tolerance in wheat.

A.","Bronze birch borer (Agrilus anxius Gory) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), a specialist wood-borer endemic to North America, is prone to periodic outbreaks that have caused widespread mortality of birch (Betula spp.) in boreal and north temperate forests. It is also the key pest of birch in ornamental landscapes. Amenity plantings have extended the distribution of birch in North America, for which we report an updated map. Life history and phenology also are summarized. Larvae feed primarily on phloem tissue of stems and branches, which can girdle and kill trees. Stressors such as drought, elevated temperature, and defoliation predispose trees to bronze birch borer colonization and trigger outbreaks, which implicates the availability of suitable host material in the bottom-up regulation of populations. Stress imposed by climate change may increase the frequency of outbreaks and alter the distribution of birch. Bronze birch borer has a diverse array of natural enemies, but their role in top-down population regulation has not been studied. There is substantial interspecific variation in resistance to this insect. North American species share a coevolutionary history with bronze birch borer and are much more resistant than Eurasian species, which are evolutionarily naive. Potential resistance mechanisms are reviewed. The high susceptibility of Eurasian birch species and climatic similarities of North America and Eurasia create high risk of widespread birch mortality in Eurasia if the borer was inadvertently introduced.

B.","Over the past century, two introduced Eurasian trees, saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) have become wide spread on western United States of American (U. S.) rivers. This paper reviews the literature on the following five key areas related to their distribution and abundance in the western United States: (1) the history of introduction, planting, and spread of saltcedar and Russian olive; (2) their current distribution; (3) their current abundance; (4) factors controlling their current distribution and abundance; and (5) models that have been developed to predict their future distribution and abundance. Saltcedar and Russian olive are now the third and fourth most frequently occurring woody riparian plants and the second and fifth most abundant species (out of 42 native and non-native species) along rivers in the western United States. Currently there is not a precise estimate of the areas that these species occupy in the entire West. Climatic variables are important determinants of their distribution and abundance. For example, saltcedar is limited by its sensitivity to hard freezes, whereas Russian olive appears to have a chilling requirement for bud break and seed germination, and can presumably survive colder winter temperatures. Either species can be dominant, co-dominant or sub-dominant relative to native species on a given river system. A number of environmental factors such as water availability, soil salinity, degree of streamflow regulation, and fire frequency can influence the abundance of these species relative to native species. Numerous studies suggest that both species have spread on western rivers primarily through a replacement process, whereby stress-tolerant species have moved into expanded niches that are no longer suitable for mesic native pioneer species. Better maps of current distribution and rigorous monitoring of distributional changes though time can help to resolve differences in predictions of potential future spread. An adequate understanding does not yet exist of what fraction of western riparian zones is resistant to dominance by either of these species, what fraction is at risk and could benefit from intervention, and what fraction has been altered to the point that saltcedar or Russian olive are most likely to thrive.",2011,"","Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences","30","6","508-523","WOS:000298323800002","10.1080/07352689.2011.615689","","#8687","Nagler 2011","Colleen Miller (2024-08-29 04:00:20)(Select): discuss invasion of Canada of Russian olive (presumably from US);","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

P.; Erickson, T.","Introduction Climate change has been scientifically documented, and its effects on wildlife have been prognosticated. We sought to predict the overall impact of climate change on venomous terrestrial species. We hypothesize that given the close relationship between terrestrial venomous species and climate, a changing global environment may result in increased species migration, geographical redistribution, and longer seasons for envenomation, which would have repercussions on human health. Methods A retrospective analysis of environmental, ecological, and medical literature was performed with a focus on climate change, toxinology, and future modeling specific to venomous terrestrial creatures. Species included venomous reptiles, snakes, arthropods, spiders, and Hymenoptera (ants and bees). Animals that are vectors of hemorrhagic infectious disease (eg, mosquitos, ticks) were excluded. Results Our review of the literature indicates that changes to climatic norms will have a potentially dramatic effect on terrestrial venomous creatures. Empirical evidence demonstrates that geographic distributions of many species have already shifted due to changing climatic conditions. Given that most terrestrial venomous species are ectotherms closely tied to ambient temperature, and that climate change is shifting temperature zones away from the equator, further significant distribution and population changes should be anticipated. For those species able to migrate to match the changing temperatures, new geographical locations may open. For those species with limited distribution capabilities, the rate of climate change may accelerate faster than species can adapt, causing population declines. Specifically, poisonous snakes and spiders will likely maintain their population numbers but will shift their geographic distribution to traditionally temperate zones more often inhabited by humans. Fire ants and Africanized honey bees are expected to have an expanded range distribution due to predicted warming trends. Human encounters with these types of creatures are likely to increase, resulting in potential human morbidity and mortality.

Adult Pacific salmon, including sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), coho (O. kisutch), Chinook (O. tshawytscha), pink (O. gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) have been captured throughout the Arctic. Pink and chum salmon are the most common species found in the Arctic today. These species are less dependent on freshwater habitats as juveniles and grow quickly in marine habitats. Putative spawning populations are rare in the North American Arctic and limited to pink salmon in drainages north of Point Hope, Alaska, chum salmon spawning rivers draining to the northwestern Beaufort Sea, and small populations of chum and pink salmon in Canada's Mackenzie River. Pacific salmon have colonized several large river basins draining to the Kara, Laptev and East Siberian seas in the Russian Arctic. These populations probably developed from hatchery supplementation efforts in the 1960's. Hundreds of populations of Arctic Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are found in Russia, Norway and Finland. Atlantic salmon have extended their range eastward as far as the Kara Sea in central Russian. A small native population of Atlantic salmon is found in Canada's Ungava Bay. The northern tip of Quebec seems to be an Atlantic salmon migration barrier for other North American stocks. Compatibility between life history requirements and ecological conditions are prerequisite for salmon colonizing Arctic habitats.

M.","The New England - Acadian Forest (NEAF) is an ecoregion spanning 24 million hectares of the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. The region is characterized as a transitional forest naturally composed of both boreal and temperate species. The term """"borealization"""" is sometimes used to describe various processes driving the NEAF toward a more boreal character at the expense of its temperate forest species and ecological communities. That the NEAF has undergone significant landscape-scale change in the last four centuries since European settlement is well understood. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the literature on the forest composition and dynamics of this region to investigate whether past, current, and (or) predicted future processes of change are indeed driving the forest toward a more boreal character. We examine studies on the historical forest composition and impacts of past and current land-use practices, as well as indirect anthropogenic changes that are predicted to influence future forest compositions of the NEAF. We review over 100 peer-reviewed scientific journal articles and government reports related to this issue. We find ample evidence to suggest that, at the landscape scale, there has been widespread replacement of temperate tree species by boreal species since European settlement. Five primary drivers have facilitated borealization across the NEAF: logging and high-grading, natural reforestation of abandoned farmland, industrial clearcutting, anthropogenic fire, and boreal conifer plantations. Furthermore, the borealization of the NEAF has continued to occur in direct contrast to the predicted impacts of climate change. We encourage future scholarship to tackle these aspects of borealization in the NEAF, including its social, economic, and ecological implications.",2020,"SEP","Environmental Reviews","28","3","284-293","WOS:000563772300006","10.1139/er-2019-0068","","#8939","Noseworthy 2020","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

M.; Stetter, A. P.; Stevens, P. W.; Swanson, K. M.; Williams, L. H.; Brush, J. M.; Marchionno, J.; Bardou, R.","Climate change is transforming ecosystems and affecting ecosystem goods and services. Along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of the southeastern United States, the frequency and intensity of extreme freeze events greatly influence whether coastal wetlands are dominated by freeze-sensitive woody plants (mangrove forests) or freeze-tolerant grass-like plants (salt marshes). In response to warming winters, mangroves have been expanding and displacing salt marshes at varying degrees of severity in parts of north Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. As winter warming accelerates, mangrove range expansion is expected to increasingly modify wetland ecosystem structure and function. Because there are differences in the ecological and societal benefits that salt marshes and mangroves provide, coastal environmental managers are challenged to anticipate the effects of mangrove expansion on critical wetland ecosystem services, including those related to carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, storm protection, erosion reduction, water purification, fisheries support, and recreation. Mangrove range expansion may also affect wetland stability in the face of extreme climatic events and rising sea levels. Here, we review the current understanding of the effects of mangrove range expansion and displacement of salt marshes on wetland ecosystem services in the southeastern United States. We also identify critical knowledge gaps and emerging research needs regarding the ecological and societal implications of salt marsh displacement by expanding mangrove forests. One consistent theme throughout our review is that there are ecological trade-offs for consideration by coastal managers. Mangrove expansion and marsh displacement can produce beneficial changes in some ecosystem services, while simultaneously producing detrimental changes in other services. Thus, there can be local-scale differences in perceptions of the impacts of mangrove expansion into salt marshes.

"115","Climate change and <i>Ixodes</i> tick-borne diseases of humans","Ostfeld, R. S.; Brunner, J. L.","The evidence that climate warming is changing the distribution of Ixodes ticks and the pathogens they transmit is reviewed and evaluated. The primary approaches are either phenomenological, which typically assume that climate alone limits current and future distributions, or mechanistic, asking which tick-demographic parameters are affected by specific abiotic conditions. Both approaches have promise but are severely limited when applied separately. For instance, phenomenological approaches (e.g. climate envelope models) often select abiotic variables arbitrarily and produce results that can be hard to interpret biologically. On the other hand, although laboratory studies demonstrate strict temperature and humidity thresholds for tick survival, these limits rarely apply to field situations. Similarly, no studies address the influence of abiotic conditions on more than a few life stages, transitions or demographic processes, preventing comprehensive assessments. Nevertheless, despite their divergent approaches, both mechanistic and phenomenological models suggest dramatic range expansions of Ixodes ticks and tick-borne disease as the climate warms. The predicted distributions, however, vary strongly with the models' assumptions, which are rarely tested against reasonable alternatives. These inconsistencies, limited data about key tick-demographic and climatic processes and only limited incorporation of non-climatic processes have weakened the application of this rich area of research to public health policy or actions. We urge further investigation of the influence of climate on vertebrate hosts and tick-borne pathogen dynamics.

"116","The genic view of hybridization in the Anthropocene","Ottenburghs, J.","Human impact is noticeable around the globe, indicating that a new era might have begun: the Anthropocene. Continuing human activities, including land-use changes, introduction of non-native species and rapid climate change, are altering the distributions of countless species, often giving rise to human-mediated hybridization events. While the interbreeding of different populations or species can have detrimental effects, such as genetic extinction, it can be beneficial in terms of adaptive introgression or an increase in genetic diversity. In this paper, I first review the different mechanisms and outcomes of anthropogenic hybridization based on literature from the last five years (2016-2020). The most common mechanisms leading to the interbreeding of previously isolated taxa include habitat change (51% of the studies) and introduction of non-native species (34% intentional and 19% unintentional). These human-induced hybridization events most often result in introgression (80%). The high incidence of genetic exchange between the hybridizing taxa indicates that the application of a genic view of speciation (and introgression) can provide crucial insights on how to address hybridization events in the Anthropocene. This perspective considers the genome as a dynamic collection of genetic loci with distinct evolutionary histories, giving rise to a heterogenous genomic landscape in terms of genetic differentiation and introgression. First, understanding this genomic landscape can lead to a better selection of diagnostic genetic markers to characterize hybrid populations. Second, describing how introgression patterns vary across the genome can help to predict the likelihood of negative processes, such as demographic and genetic swamping, as well as positive outcomes, such as adaptive introgression. It is especially important to not only quantify how much genetic material introgressed, but also what has been exchanged. Third, comparing introgression patterns in pre-Anthropocene hybridization events with current human-induced cases might provide novel insights into the likelihood of genetic swamping or species collapse during an anthropogenic hybridization event. However, this comparative approach remains to be tested before it can be applied in practice. Finally, the genic view of introgression can be combined with conservation genomic studies to determine the legal status of hybrids and take appropriate measures to manage anthropogenic hybridization events. The interplay between evolutionary and conservation genomics will result in the constant exchange of ideas between these fields which will not only improve our knowledge on the origin of species, but also how to conserve and protect them.",2021,"OCT","Evolutionary Applications","14","10","2342-2360","WOS:000632950600001","10.1111/eva.13223","","#9172","Ottenburghs 2021","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"117","Detection of range shifts: General methodological issues and case studies of butterflies","Parmesan, C.","Range shifts are perhaps the least controversial as well as the most easily observed responses expected under global warming scenarios. While changes at single study sites and along single species' range boundaries have been studied in a diversity of taxa, the wealth of historical records for butterflies has allowed changes across entire species' ranges to be analysed. This becomes important in distinguishing local distribution changes from systematic poleward/upward range shifts. Examination of 58 species in North America and Europe documented poleward shifts of species' ranges in proportions far higher than one would expect by chance. The magnitudes of the observed range shifts (boundary movement from 35 to 200 km) is on the same order as the magnitudes of regional warming (from 0.7 to 0.8 degreesC, equating to movement of temperature isotherms by 92 to 120 km). Coupled with general global warming, extreme weather and climate events have been increasing in magnitude and frequency on a global scale. Previous basic research on butterflies has provided detailed information on the mechanistic links between climate and population dynamics, reproductive behaviour, and extinction/colonisation dynamics. A synthesis of these studies indicates that such extreme climate events have driven observed butterfly range shifts. The sensitivity of butterflies to climate, the temporal and spatial breadth of distributional data (especially for European species), as well as the wealth of basic biological knowledge, allow studies of butterflies to provide an in-depth understanding of current impacts of climate change on wildlife. Further, the effects of non-climatic global change factors have been studied for many species. Species' habitat requirements are often well understood, and butterflies have served as useful organisms for studies of habitat fragmentation and restoration. These complementary fields of study, taken together, poise butterflies for being ideal models for understanding the intersecting effects of modern environmental changes, particularly the hardships imposed by climate change across an increasingly hostile landscape.",2001,"","FINGERPRINTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE: ADAPTED BEHAVIOUR AND SHIFTING SPECIES RANGES","","","57-76","WOS:000174089000004","","","#9358","Parmesan 2001","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-01 16:48:28)(Select): I couldn't find the whole reference, but I read enough pages in Google Books that I agree with Meagan - the distribution map includes Mexico, US, and Canada - and there is reference to poleward movement.

To help inform conservation management and policy responses, we present the results of an expert assessment of the threats that members of this taxonomic group face across migratory flyways. Most threats are increasing in intensity, particularly in non-breeding areas, where habitat loss resulting from residential and commercial development, aquaculture, mining, transport, disturbance, problematic invasive species, pollution and climate change were regarded as having the greatest detrimental impact. Fewer threats (mining, disturbance, problematic native species and climate change) were identified as widely affecting breeding areas. Numeniini populations face the greatest number of non-breeding threats in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, especially those associated with coastal reclamation; related threats were also identified across the Central and Atlantic Americas, and East Atlantic flyways. Threats on the breeding grounds were greatest in Central and Atlantic Americas, East Atlantic and West Asian flyways. Three priority actions were associated with monitoring and research: to monitor breeding population trends (which for species breeding in remote areas may best be achieved through surveys at key non-breeding sites), to deploy tracking technologies to identify migratory connectivity, and to monitor land-cover change across breeding and non-breeding areas. Two priority actions were focused on conservation and policy responses: to identify and effectively protect key non-breeding sites across all flyways (particularly in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway), and to implement successful conservation interventions at a sufficient scale across human-dominated landscapes for species' recovery to be achieved.

E.","Understanding fish movement in the Arctic is paramount during the current era of rapidly warming seas, receding sea ice and associated shifting species distributions and fishing effort. We synthesized the literature and identified key knowledge gaps on the movement ecology of Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) and Polar/Ice cod (Arctogadus glacialis, both Gadidae) in the context of climate change. Standardized web-based English-language literature searches yielded 51 articles directly relevant and 122 indirectly relevant for the movement ecology of these species combined. Most articles were primarily relevant to B. saida (85% of total filtered articles), occurred during open water season (49/38%) with focus on distribution (32/22%), predators (30/22%), seasonal spawning/feeding movements (22/19%), sea ice association (22/26%), climate change (20/15%) and vertical movements (17/19%) with few focused on horizontal dynamics (3/0%; B. saida/A. glacialis, respectively). Disproportionate data resolution has resulted in greater predictive power of movement models for the European (29% of articles) and North American (86%) Arctic regions relative to the logistically challenging Central Arctic Ocean and Russian-Siberian Arctic shelves (both 7%). The movements of circumpolar Arctic gadids are dependent on complex dynamics that include regional currents, the longevity of ice-flows and polynyas, water stratification and coastal hydrology. Dependence on these interactive and often co-dependent processes highlights major pathways and barriers to movement and distribution at higher latitudes.

"122","Major perturbations in the Earth's forest ecosystems. Possible implications for global warming","Pravalie, R.","Forests are among the most important terrestrial ecological systems in terms of the multitude of ecosystem functions and services they provide. These biotic systems are vital not only for ensuring the wellbeing of human society and for preserving global biodiversity, but also for regulating the climate system, decarbonizing the atmosphere via carbon sequestration (in biomass or underlying soil carbon pools) and evaporative cooling processes that mitigate climate warming. However, forest ecosystems are currently being subjected to a wide range of natural and anthropic disturbances that pose a real threat not only to forest health and the various benefits forests provide for human society, but also to the overall functioning of the global system. This paper is a review that aims to analyse, in a brief and holistic manner, the main perturbations Earth forest ecosystems are currently facing, both the obvious (e.g. deforestation) and discrete/silent ones (e.g. defaunation) that have generally not yet been tackled strictly as ecological forest issues in the international scientific literature. At the same time, the paper aims to highlight the possible effects generated by forest perturbations in the global warming process, through carbon fluxes and biogeophysical feedbacks between these terrestrial systems and the atmosphere. Upon analysis of a vast scientific bibliography, it was found there currently are 12 major forest disturbances that can be grouped into three categories based on the prevalence of triggering causes, i.e. climatic (phenological shifts, range shifts, die-off events, insect infestations), anthropic (deforestation, fragmentation, air pollution) and mixed (defaunation, fires, composition shifts, net primary productivity shifts, biogeochemical shifts) perturbations. These ecological issues, which occur frequently, intensely and on large spatial scales, are able to significantly disrupt forest productivity and therefore strongly erode the forests'capacity to stabilize the climate system. All identified disturbances can amplify global warming in various ways, including by means of many positive feedback mechanisms in the case of climatic perturbations. Finally, this review paper proposes five major anthropogenic strategies to fight this multidimensional forest crisis mitigate, adapt, repair, protect and research actions, which, if implemented rapidly, efficiently and on a large scale via international policies, can successfully stabilize these terrestrial ecosystems and, implicitly, the climate system in the 21st century.",2018,"OCT","Earth-Science Reviews","185","","544-571","WOS:000448493500025","10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.06.010","","#9776","Pravalie 2018","Elizabeth  Gallegos  (2024-08-31 07:18:57)(Select): Not transboundary explicit ; Tyler McIntosh (2024-08-28 05:14:51)(Select): a useful overview of perturbations in forest systems, including a whole section of climatic perturbations that could be transboundary.

P.","In his seminal work, Hjort (in Fluctuations in the great fisheries of Northern Europe. Conseil Parmanent International Pour L'Exploration De La Mar. Rapports et Proces-Verbaux, 20: 1-228, 1914) observed that fish population levels fluctuated widely, year-class strength was set early in life, and egg production by adults could not alone explain variability in year-class strength. These observations laid the foundation for hypotheses on mechanisms driving recruitment variability in marine systems. More recently, researcher shave sought to explain year-class strength of important fish in the Laurentian Great Lakes and some of the hypotheses developed for marine fisheries have been transferred to Great Lakes fish. We conducted a literature review to determine the applicability of marine recruitment hypotheses to Great Lakes fish. We found that temperature, interspecific interactions, and spawner effects (abundance, age, and condition of adults) were the most important factors in explaining recruitment variability in Great Lakes fish, whereas relatively fewer studies identified bottom-up trophodynamic factors or hydrodynamic factors as important. Next, we compared recruitment between Great Lakes and Baltic Sea fish populations and found no statistical difference in factors driving recruitment between the two systems, indicating that recruitment hypotheses may often be transferable between Great Lakes and marine systems. Many recruitment hypotheses developed for marine fish have yet to be applied to Great Lakes fish. We suggest that future research on recruitment in the Great Lakes should focus on forecasting the effects of climate change and invasive species.

Here we test the prediction that, if impacts of ongoing climate change on performance in marginal populations are widespread, then populations from the high-latitude margin (HLM) should perform as well as or better than central populations, whereas low-latitude margin (LLM) populations should perform worse. Location: Global. Time period: 1995-2019. Major taxa studied: Plants and animals. Methods:To test our prediction, we used a meta-analysis to quantify empirical support for asymmetry in the performance of high- and low-latitude margin populations compared to central populations. Performance estimates (survival, reproduction, or lifetime fitness) for populations occurring in their natural environment were derived from 51 papers involving 113 margin-centre comparisons from 54 species and 705 populations from the Americas, Europe, Africa and Australia. We then related these performance differences to climatic differences among populations. We also tested whether patterns are consistent across taxonomic kingdoms (plants vs animals) and across realms (marine vs terrestrial). Results: Populations at margins performed significantly worse than central populations, and this trend was primarily driven by the low-latitude margin. Although the difference was of small magnitude, it was largely consistent across biological kingdoms and realms. Differences in performance were weakly (p = .08) related to the difference in average temperatures between central and marginal populations.

We present a conceptual framework and empirical review of the interactive effects of climate change and invasive species in freshwater ecosystems, Climate change is expected to result in warmer water temperatures, shorter duration of ice cover, altered streamflow patterns, increased salinization, and increased demand for water storage and conveyance structures. These changes will alter the pathways by which non-native species enter aquatic systems by expanding fish-culture facilities and water gardens to new areas and by facilitating the spread of species during floods. Climate change will influence the likelihood of new species becoming established by eliminating cold temperatures or winter hypoxia that currently prevent survival and by increasing the construction of reservoirs that serve as hotspots for invasive species. Climate change will modify the ecological impacts of invasive species by enhancing their competitive and predatory effects on native species and by increasing the virulence of some diseases. As a result of climate change, new prevention and control strategies such as barrier construction or removal efforts may be needed to control invasive species that currently have only moderate effects or that are limited by seasonally unfavorable conditions, Although most researchers focus on how climate change will increase the number and severity of invasions, some invasive coldwater species may be unable to persist under the new climate conditions.

T.","Climate changes impose requirements for many species to shift their ranges to remain within environmentally tolerable areas, but near-continuous regions of intense human land use stretching across continental extents diminish dispersal prospects for many species. We reviewed the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation on species' abilities to track changing climates and existing plans to facilitate species dispersal in response to climate change through regions of intensive land uses, drawing on examples from North America and elsewhere. We identified an emerging analytical framework that accounts for variation in species' dispersal capacities relative to both the pace of climate change and habitat availability. Habitat loss and fragmentation hinder climate change tracking, particularly for specialists, by impeding both propagule dispersal and population growth. This framework can be used to identify prospective modern-era climatic refugia, where the pace of climate change has been slower than surrounding areas, that are defined relative to individual species' needs. The framework also underscores the importance of identifying and managing dispersal pathways or corridors through semi-continental land use barriers that can benefit many species simultaneously. These emerging strategies to facilitate range shifts must account for uncertainties around population adaptation to local environmental conditions.

This review is aimed at providing a complete description of the fungus, its distribution, the conditions for its spread, and the impact of climate change and at summarising the relevant forest management methods. Due to the worldwide importance of the pathogen, a retrospective review is required to summarise the lessons learned in relation to the disease, considering application to future outbreaks.Recent FindingsWe revise available management methods, considering examples of control strategies, with special focus on the silvicultural approaches, and we also revise the recovery of the affected stands and the associated trade-offs. Forest disturbances such as pests and disease outbreaks are expected to be exacerbated by climate change, although the exact impact on all host-pathogen interactions remains unclear. In regions with a high risk of G. abietina epidemics, climate change is expected to affect the pathogen differently.Gremmeniella abietina is a widely distributed forest pathogen in Europe and is also present in North America. Based on the conclusions reached in this review, forest stands may recover from pathogen outbreaks within 10 years, with considerable loss of growth and the risk of attack from secondary factors. Provenance selection is vital for preventing outbreaks. Climate change is expected to have different effects: in some areas, it is likely to increase the conditions conducive to the development of the fungus, while in others, it is likely to limit the spread because of high temperatures and low humidity.

A.","Nesting populations of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the Atlantic and western Indian Oceans are increasing or stable while those in the Pacific are declining. It has been suggested that leatherbacks in the eastern Pacific may be resource limited due to environmental variability derived from the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), but this has yet to be tested. Here we explored bottom-up forcing and the responding reproductive output of nesting leatherbacks worldwide. We achieved this through an extensive review of leatherback nesting and migration data and by analyzing the spatial, temporal, and quantitative nature of resources as indicated by net primary production at post-nesting female migration and foraging areas. Leatherbacks in the eastern Pacific were the smallest in body size and had the lowest reproductive output due to less productive and inconsistent resources within their migration and foraging areas. This derived from natural interannual and multidecadal climate variability together with an influence of anthropogenic climate warming that is possibly affecting these natural cycles. The reproductive output of leatherbacks in the Atlantic and western Indian Oceans was nearly twice that of turtles in the eastern Pacific. The inconsistent nature of the Pacific Ocean may also render western Pacific leatherbacks susceptible to a more variable reproductive output; however, it appears that egg harvesting on nesting beaches is their major threat. We suggest that the eastern Pacific leatherback population is more sensitive to anthropogenic mortality due to recruitment rates that are lower and more variable, thus accounting for much of the population differences compared to Atlantic and western Indian turtles.",2008,"MAY","Ecology","89","5","1414-1427","WOS:000256101200023","10.1890/07-0364.1","","#10536","Saba 2008","Dayo Osinubi (2024-08-28 07:33:37)(Select): Review of nesting populations of leatherback turtles, with some coverage of parts of North America.

Much research has focused on the effects of forest management and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem level processes of the boreal forest. However, even though climate change and the increasing rate of resource exploitation are likely to intensify the arrival and establishment of exotic species with the potential to become invasive, the boreal forest continues to be viewed as inhospitable to incoming species and we have little understanding of its invasive species status. We reviewed the literature and compiled information on the current status of invasive species across all taxa present in the North American boreal forest. We found that an increasing number of exotic plants, insects, earthworms, slugs and pathogens are establishing in the boreal forest. Research is scarce and their ecological effects are poorly understood. However, given that some of the reported species represent a major driver of change in many ecosystems globally, we expect that this review will provide direction for invasive species research as well as preventative measures aimed at better understanding and conserving Earth's largest terrestrial biome.",2012,"JUL","FORESTRY","85","3","329-339","WOS:000305033500004","10.1093/forestry/cps033","","#10679","Sanderson 2012","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Co-invasion of parasites and their hosts is leading to the emergence of infectious diseases at a global scale, underlining the need for integration of biological invasions and disease ecology research. In this review, the ecological and evolutionary factors influencing the invasion process of parasites with complex life cycles were analysed, using the invasion of the European strain of Echinococcus multilocularis in North America as a model. The aim was to propose an ecological framework for investigating the invasion of parasites that are trophically transmitted through predator-prey interactions, showing how despite the complexity of the cycles and the interactions among multiple hosts, such parasites can overcome multiple barriers and become invasive. Identifying the key ecological processes affecting the success of parasite invasions is an important step for risk assessment and development of management strategies, particularly for parasites with the potential to infect people (i.e. zoonotic).",2021,"NOV","Parasitology","148","13","1532-1544","WOS:000721320100004","10.1017/S0031182021001426","","#10700","Santa 2021","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-19 13:31:28)(Select): Definitely relavent!

A.; Jacques, J.; Plante, N.; Fournier, V.; Pérez-López, E.","Climate change has facilitated the introduction, establishment, and movement of invasive species in northern regions, enabling the colonization of previously unsuitable areas. While the responses of insects to these changes have been increasingly studied, our understanding of how such alterations impact trophic interactions still requires further research to make reliable predictions about the spread of diseases in a warming world. Phytoplasmas, a group of obligate parasitic unculturable Mollicutes, primarily rely on leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) for transmission, spread, and survival. Phytoplasmas are associated with over 600 diseases affecting more than 1,000 plant species, including berries, grapevines, and other small fruits. In North America, diseases such as grapevine yellows, blueberry stunt, and strawberry green petal diseases have been linked to phytoplasma strains transmitted by known leafhopper species. However, the number of phytoplasma diseases has significantly increased in North America over the past decade, suggesting the presence of unidentified vectors or an abundance of leafhopper vectors. This short review provides an overview of the current knowledge on leafhoppers as vectors of phytoplasmas to berries, focusing on the last decade's research in Canada. This paper also explores the potential implications of climate change on this pathosystem, including the anticipated range expansion of leafhopper species, changes in phytoplasma acquisition and transmission, and the risk of new leafhopper-transmitted plant-pathogen introductions through the arrival of new leafhopper species.",2024,"JAN 17","Annals of the Entomological Society of America","117","1","14-20","WOS:001120750600001","10.1093/aesa/saad038","","#10717","Santos 2024","Tyler McIntosh (2024-09-07 03:08:03)(Select): c1: yes

D.","We review recent works on different life history variables of cladoceran taxa in tropical and temperate freshwater bodies, comparing the strategies that cladocerans have evolved to adapt to contrasting environmental conditions in the two geographical regions. These life-history parameters relate to age and size at maturity, survival, fecundity, life-expectancy at birth, lifespan, gross, and net reproductive rates, generation time, the rate of population increase, peak population density and day of peak abundance. We also discuss the role of photoperiod and temperature on some of these life history parameters. We found a general paucity of experimental work and field data in tropics on cladocerans. There is very limited information on the few Daphnia species found in the tropics. The misconception of low species diversity of cladocerans in the tropics arose due to several reasons including lack of extensive and intensive field collections. Higher water temperatures apparently promote permanent infestation of tropical waters with toxic cyanobacteria, which reduce the zooplankton diversity. In addition to higher temperatures in the tropics, the year-round high predation pressure of planktivorous fish probably causes the tropical species, particularly in pelagic habitats, to reach maturity earlier (< 3 days) than in temperate regions. Species of Daphnia in temperate regions are particularly adapted to living at food concentrations that are much lower and seasonably more variable than those for tropical genera such as Diaphanosoma. This is further corroborated by the more than an order of magnitude higher threshold food concentration (TFC for tropical Cladocera than for their temperate counterparts. Fecundity patterns differ between tropical and temperate cladoceran taxa: cultured under optimal temperature regimes, tropical taxa have fewer eggs than temperate species of a comparable body size. Predation pressure may act differently depending on the size of the cladoceran neonates and thus on their population size structure. Global warming and climate changes seem to affect the behaviour (migration), distribution, and abundance of cladocerans. Apparently, in direct response to these changes, the possibility of encountering the tropical cladocerans in the northern, temperate hemisphere (bioinvasions) is on the rise.",2005,"JUL 1","Hydrobiologia","542","","315-333","WOS:000231879200030","10.1007/s10750-004-3247-2","","#10746","Sarma 2005","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

L.","The wolverine is a wide-ranging and frequently at-risk or data-deficient species with dramatic range contractions across the northern hemisphere. Recent reports of low population densities inside and outside protected areas in western North America highlight the need for better conservation practice, policy, and planning across large landscapes. To assess broad habitat needs, we synthesized available wolverine habitat models in the Columbia and Rocky Mountains (63,000 km2), Canada. We used coefficients from four existing models to create spatial predictions over environmental datasets including snow, landcover, and roads. We averaged predictions using the distance-weighted mean of equal-area percentile habitat values and validated the output by comparison to independent data. Because persistent spring snow is tightly correlated with highquality habitat, we assessed 2080 spring snow cover forecasts (under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 high emissions scenario) to identify potential habitat refugia in British Columbia. Our synthesized habitat model identified high-quality habitat along mountain ranges, notably in the Purcell Mountains and the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains. Mean habitat value was 0.70 (SD: 0.19) inside protected areas and 0.55 (SD: 0.28) outside protected areas. The British Columbia side of the study area is forecasted to lose 44% of persistent spring snow cover by 2080, with declines identified inside many protected areas. By synthesizing existing habitat research and climate forecasts, we provided new insights at the broad spatial scale needed to conserve wide-ranging species like wolverine and to inform land-use planning for recreational access and the establishment and management of protected and conserved areas.",2023,"OCT","Global Ecology and Conservation","46","","","WOS:001056129400001","10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02540","","#10822","Schepens 2023","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

A.","P>The introduced pathogen Cronartium ribicola, cause of white pine blister rust, has spread across much of western North America and established known infestations within all but one species of white pine endemic to western Canada and the United States. Blister rust damage to severely diseased trees reduces reproduction and survival. Severe losses in white pine populations have resulted in site conversions to other species and seriously impacted resource values for timber, wildlife, watershed, recreation, aesthetic and other ecosystem services. In addition to blister rust, other major forest health threats and challenges to sustaining or restoring white pine populations are infestations of other pathogens, insects, fire, management practices that favour other tree species, and climatic change. Recent, large-scale outbreaks of mountain pine beetle have raised concerns for the viability of some white pine populations. In the 1960s, forest disease management for western white pine and sugar pine shifted from Ribes eradication to planting seedlings selected for better survival and resistance to blister rust. Seed orchards for producing improved white pines have been established, but deployment of that improved stock is hampered by a lack of planting opportunities. The inheritance and mechanisms of resistance are best known for western white pine and sugar pine; but new work is extending an understanding of genetics to all the western species of white pine. Current management efforts are focused on locating and protecting individual trees resistant to blister rust and assessing their disease resistance and other adaptive traits. In response to the threats from blister rust, the strategic goal is to sustain or restore viable white pine populations in western forest ecosystems. The four action components of the strategy are: (1) conserve genetic resistance to C. ribicola; (2) reduce the risk of adverse impact in stands currently uninfested; (3) restore and maintain white pines where blister rust is causing impacts and (4) assess and monitor the health and management of white pines.

"136","Impacts of climate warming on hybrid zone movement: Geographically diffuse and biologically porous """"species borders""""","Scriber, J. M.","The ecology and evolutionary biology of insect-plant associations has realized extensive attention, especially during the past 60 years. The classifications (categorical designations) of continuous variation in biodiversity, ranging from global patterns (e.g., latitudinal gradients in species richness/diversity and degree of herbivore feeding specialization) to localized insect-plant associations that span the biospectrum from polyphenisms, polymorphisms, biotypes, demes, host races, to cryptic species, remain academically contentious. Semantic and biosystematic (taxonomical) disagreements sometimes detract from more important ecological and evolutionary processes that drive diversification, the dynamics of gene flow and local extinctions. This review addresses several aspects of insect specialization, host-associated divergence and ecological (including """"hybrid"""") speciation, with special reference to the climate warming impacts on species borders of hybridizing swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae). Interspecific hybrid introgression may result in collapse of multi-species communities or increase species numbers via homoploid hybrid speciation. We may see diverging, merging, or emerging genotypes across hybrid zones, all part of the ongoing processes of evolution. Molecular analyses of genetic mosaics and genomic dynamics with """"divergence hitchhiking"""", combined with ecological, ethological and physiological studies of """"species porosity"""", have already begun to unveil some answers for some important ecological/evolutionary questions. (i) How rapidly can host-associated divergence lead to new species (and why doesn't it always do so, e.g., resulting in """"incomplete"""" speciation)? (ii) How might """"speciation genes"""" function, and how/where would we find them? (iii) Can oscillations from specialists to generalists and back to specialists help explain global diversity in herbivorous insects? (iv) How could recombinant interspecific hybridization lead to divergence and speciation? From ancient phytochemically defined angiosperm affiliations to recent and very local geographical mosaics, the Papilionidae (swallowtail butterflies) have provided a model for enhanced understanding of ecological patterns and evolutionary processes, including host-associated genetic divergence, genomic mosaics, genetic hitchhiking and sex-linked speciation genes. Apparent homoploid hybrid speciation in Papilio appears to have been catalyzed by climate warming-induced interspecific introgression of some, but not all, species diagnostic traits, reflecting strong divergent selection (discordant), especially on the Z (= X) chromosome. Reproductive isolation of these novel recombinant hybrid genotypes appears to be accomplished via a delayed post-diapause emergence or temporal isolation, and is perhaps aided by the thermal landscape.

L.","Climate change is adversely affecting the burden of infectious disease throughout the world, which is a health security threat. Climate-sensitive infectious disease includes vector-borne diseases such as malaria, whose transmission potential is expected to increase because of enhanced climatic suitability for the mosquito vector in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. Climatic suitability for the mosquitoes that can carry dengue, Zika, and chikungunya is also likely to increase, facilitating further increases in the geographic range and longer transmission seasons, and raising concern for expansion of these diseases into temperate zones, particularly under higher greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Early spring temperatures in 2018 seem to have contributed to the early onset and extensive West Nile virus outbreak in Europe, a pathogen expected to expand further beyond its current distribution, due to a warming climate. As for tick-borne diseases, climate change is projected to continue to contribute to the spread of Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis, particularly in North America and Europe. Schistosomiasis is a waterborne disease and public health concern in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia; climate change is anticipated to change its distribution, with both expansions and contractions expected. Other water-borne diseases that cause diarrheal diseases have declined significantly over the last decades owing to socioeconomic development and public health measures but changes in climate can reverse some of these positive developments. Weather and climate events, population movement, land use changes, urbanization, global trade, and other drivers can catalyze a succession of secondary events that can lead to a range of health impacts, including infectious disease outbreaks.

M.","Background: Herbivores modify the structure and function of tundra ecosystems. Understanding their impacts is necessary to assess the responses of these ecosystems to ongoing environmental changes. However, the effects of herbivores on plants and ecosystem structure and function vary across the Arctic. Strong spatial variation in herbivore effects implies that the results of individual studies on herbivory depend on local conditions, i.e., their ecological context. An important first step in assessing whether generalizable conclusions can be produced is to identify the existing studies and assess how well they cover the underlying environmental conditions across the Arctic. This systematic map aims to identify the ecological contexts in which herbivore impacts on vegetation have been studied in the Arctic. Specifically, the primary question of the systematic map was: """"What evidence exists on the effects of herbivores on Arctic vegetation?"""". Methods: We used a published systematic map protocol to identify studies addressing the effects of herbivores on Arctic vegetation. We conducted searches for relevant literature in online databases, search engines and specialist websites. Literature was screened to identify eligible studies, defined as reporting primary data on herbivore impacts on Arctic plants and plant communities. We extracted information on variables that describe the ecological context of the studies, from the studies themselves and from geospatial data. We synthesized the findings narratively and created a Shiny App where the coded data are searchable and variables can be visually explored. Review findings We identified 309 relevant articles with 662 studies (representing different ecological contexts or datasets within the same article). These studies addressed vertebrate herbivory seven times more often than invertebrate herbivory. Geographically, the largest cluster of studies was in Northern Fennoscandia. Warmer and wetter parts of the Arctic had the largest representation, as did coastal areas and areas where the increase in temperature has been moderate. In contrast, studies spanned the full range of ecological context variables describing Arctic vertebrate herbivore diversity and human population density and impact. Conclusions: The current evidence base might not be sufficient to understand the effects of herbivores on Arctic vegetation throughout the region, as we identified clear biases in the distribution of herbivore studies in the Arctic and a limited evidence base on invertebrate herbivory. In particular, the overrepresentation of studies in areas with moderate increases in temperature prevents robust generalizations about the effects of herbivores under different climatic scenarios.",2021,"OCT 14","Environmental Evidence","10","1","","WOS:000707952200001","10.1186/s13750-021-00240-0","","#11470","Soininen 2021","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

T.","Aim Shifts in species ranges are a predicted and realized effect of global climate change; however, few studies have addressed the rates and consequence of such shifts, particularly in marine systems. Given ecological similarities between shifting and introduced species, we examined how our understanding of range shifts may be informed by the more established study of non-native species introductions. Location Marine systems world-wide. Methods Database and citation searches were used to identify 129 marine species experiencing range shifts and to determine spread rates and impacts on recipient communities. Analyses of spread rates were based on studies for which post-establishment spread was reported in linear distance. The sizes of the effects of community impacts of shifting species were compared with those of functionally similar introduced species having ecologically similar impacts. Results Our review and meta-analyses revealed that: (1) 75% of the range shifts found through the database search were in the poleward direction, consistent with climate change scenarios, (2) spread rates of range shifts were lower than those of introductions, (3) shifting species spread over an order of magnitude faster in marine than in terrestrial systems, and (4) directions of community effects were largely negative and magnitudes were often similar for shifters and introduced species; however, this comparison was limited by few data for range-shifting species. Main conclusions Although marine range shifts are likely to proceed more slowly than marine introductions, the community-level effects could be as great, and in the same direction, as those of introduced species. Because it is well-established that introduced species are a primary threat to global biodiversity, it follows that, just like introductions, range shifts have the potential to seriously affect biological systems. In addition, given that ranges shift faster in marine than terrestrial environments, marine communities might be affected faster than terrestrial ones as species shift with climate change.

A.","Aim: Across the planet, grass-dominated biomes are experiencing shrub encroachment driven by atmospheric CO2 enrichment and land-use change. By altering resource structure and availability, shrub encroachment may have important impacts on vertebrate communities. We sought to determine the magnitude and variability of these effects across climatic gradients, continents, and taxa, and to learn whether shrub thinning restores the structure of vertebrate communities. Location: Worldwide. Time period: Contemporary. Major taxa studied: Terrestrial vertebrates. Methods: We estimated relationships between percentage shrub cover and the structure of terrestrial vertebrate communities (species richness, Shannon diversity and community abundance) in experimentally thinned and unmanipulated shrub-encroached grass-dominated biomes using systematic review and meta-analyses of 43 studies published from 1978 to 2016. We modelled the effects of continent, biome, mean annual precipitation, net primary productivity and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on the relationship between shrub cover and vertebrate community structure. Results: Species richness, Shannon diversity and total abundance had no consistent relationship with shrub encroachment and experimental thinning did not reverse encroachment effects on vertebrate communities. However, some effects of shrub encroachment on vertebrate communities differed with net primary productivity, amongst vertebrate groups, and across continents. Encroachment had negative effects on vertebrate diversity at low net primary productivity. Mammalian and herpetofaunal diversity decreased with shrub encroachment. Shrub encroachment also had negative effects on species richness and total abundance in Africa but positive effects in North America. Main conclusions: Biodiversity conservation and mitigation efforts responding to shrub encroachment should focus on low-productivity locations, on mammals and herpetofauna, and in Africa. However, targeted research in neglected regions such as central Asia and India will be needed to fill important gaps in our knowledge of shrub encroachment effects on vertebrates.

A.; Meddens, A. J. H.","Wildfire-mediated changes to forests have prompted numerous studies on post-fire forest recovery of coniferous forests. Given climate change, a growing body of work demonstrates that conifer regeneration in temperate and boreal forests is declining, a phenomenon often termed """"regeneration failure."""" However, the definition and parameters are numerous and variable. Characterization of drought also varies greatly, thus hindering the ability to compare results among areas. This review discusses new perspectives on conifer regeneration failure and places these studies into the context of drought and fire activity. We focus this review on three forest types where conifer regeneration failure is well documented: western boreal forests, cold mixed-conifer forests, and dry pine forests. To place the challenges to conifer tree regeneration in the context of regional climate trends, we present a novel regional analysis that summarizes drought conditions prior, during, and following the year of a large wildfire. We demonstrate the need to assess failure in the context of specific forest dynamics and well-defined metrics. For example, tree establishment may historically occur over longer periods, and current and future climate may exacerbate this and not promote pre-fire forest structure and composition. Many forests are undergoing rapid change and the type, magnitude, and causes of changes need to be compared among areas. As such, we should be cautious of quantifying """"regeneration failure"""" and drought without providing spatial and temporal context.",2022,"OCT","Canadian Journal of Forest Research","52","10","1281-1302","WOS:000852807600001","10.1139/cjfr-2022-0054","","#11683","Stevens-Rumann 2022","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

As climate changes, the role and impact of diseases on trees in both forest ecosystems and in urban settings will also change. Knowledge of relationships between climate variables and diseases affecting forest and urban trees is reviewed, with specific emphasis on those affecting foliage, shoots, and stems. Evidence that forest diseases are already responding to the earth's changing climate is examined (e.g., Dothistroma needle blight in northern British Columbia) as are predicted scenarios for future changes in impact on forests by other tree diseases. Outbreaks of tree diseases caused by native and alien pathogens are predicted to become more frequent and intense - this and other general predictions about the effects of climate change on forest and tree diseases are discussed.

However, there exists limited evidence of the ecological impacts of glacier loss in meltwater streams, particularly in those outside of North America and Europe. We provide a review of the abiotic conditions in glacial streams that are potential factors of their ecosystem function and biodiversity with an emphasis on their key primary producers, namely rock-attached algae or """"epilithon"""". Here, shrinking glaciers discharge over time less turbidmelt waters, resulting in slowermoving and more transparent stream conditions that are also warmer and more chemically dilute. We hypothesize that these environmental changeswill stimulate epilithic algal growth while also shifting its community structure towards larger and less nutritious taxa. Although such an increase in algal growth may benefit the productive harvestable fish capacity of certain mountain streams, a potential negative trade-off involves the proliferation of nuisance algae (e.g., Didymosphenia geminata), which thrives under clear, nutrient-poor mountain conditions.

We then review the literature on observed and potential impacts of climate change on terrestrial biodiversity, focusing on the species' characteristics that were identified. High-elevation ecosystems such as cloud montane forests are projected to disappear entirely by the year 2100, with corresponding global losses of their endemic biodiversity.

Shifts in distribution may be possible for generalist species, but range shifts will be difficult for species with small distributions, specialized habitat requirements, slow dispersal rates, and species at high elevations. Accurate assessments of climate change impacts on biodiversity of the region are difficult because of confusion about nomenclature, the many species unknown to science, the lack of baseline data on species' ecology and distributions, and lack of fine resolution elevation data for very small islands.

T.","Ticks are able to transmit the highest number of pathogen species of any blood-feeding arthropod and represent a growing threat to public health and agricultural systems worldwide. While there are numerous and varied causes and effects of changes to tick-borne disease (re)emergence, three primary challenges to tick control were identified in this review from a U.S. borders perspective. (1) Climate change is implicated in current and future alterations to geographic ranges and population densities of tick species, pathogens they can transmit, and their host and reservoir species, as highlighted by Ixodes scapularis and its expansion across southern Canada. (2) Modern technological advances have created an increasingly interconnected world, contributing to an increase in invasive tick species introductions through the increased speed and frequency of trade and travel. The introduction of the invasive Haemaphysalis longicornis in the eastern U.S. exemplifies the challenges with control in a highly interconnected world. (3) Lastly, while not a new challenge, differences in disease surveillance, control, and management strategies in bordering countries remains a critical challenge in managing ticks and tick-borne diseases. International inter-agency collaborations along the U.S.-Mexico border have been critical in control and mitigation of cattle fever ticks (Rhipicephalus spp.) and highlight the need for continued collaboration and research into integrated tick management strategies.

"149","The Importance of Physiological Limits in Determining Biogeographical Range Shifts due to Global Climate Change: The Heat-Shock Response","Tomanek, L.","Physiological processes that set an organism's thermal limits are in part determining recent shifts in biogeographic distribution ranges due to global climate change. Several characteristics of the heat-shock response (HSR), such as the onset, maximal, and upper limit of heat-shock protein (Hsp) synthesis, contribute to setting the acute upper thermal limits of most organisms. Aquatic animals from stable, moderately variable, or highly variable thermal environments differ in their HSR. Some animals living in extremely stable thermal environments lack the response altogether. In contrast, rocky intertidal animals that experience highly variable thermal conditions start synthesizing Hsps, that is, the onset of synthesis, below the highest temperatures that they experience. Thus, these organisms experience thermal conditions in their environment that are close to the upper thermal limits in which they can defend themselves against cellular thermal insults by employing the HSR. Subtidal animals are characterized by moderately variable thermal environments, and their cells start synthesizing Hsps above the highest temperatures that they experience. The upper thermal limits against which they can defend themselves are thus much higher than the highest body temperatures they currently experience. Furthermore, the ability to acclimate to changing thermal conditions seems greatest among animals from moderately variable environments and limited in animals from stable and highly variable environments. Thus, these findings suggest that organisms with the narrowest (stenothermal) and the widest (highly eurythermal) temperature tolerance ranges live closest to their thermal limits and have a limited ability to acclimate, suggesting that they will be most affected by global climate change.",2008,"NOV-DEC","Physiological and Biochemical Zoology","81","6","709-717","WOS:000260547400002","10.1086/590163","","#12200","Tomanek 2008","Dayo Osinubi (2024-08-09 08:42:35)(Select): A review of heat stress response in determining range shift in marine snail species.

Over the past century, Lecanosticta acicola, a foliar pathogen predominantly of Pinus spp., has expanded its range globally, and is increasing in impact. Lecanosticta acicola causes brown spot needle blight, resulting in premature defoliation, reduced growth, and mortality in some hosts. Originating from southern regions of North American, it devastated forests in the USA's southern states in the early twentieth century, and in 1942 was discovered in Spain.Derived from Euphresco project 'Brownspotrisk,' this study aimed to establish the current distribution of Lecanosticta species, and assess the risks of L. acicola to European forests. Pathogen reports from the literature, and new/ unpublished survey data were combined into an open-access geo-database (http://www.portaloff orestpathology.com), and used to visualise the pathogen's range, infer its climatic tolerance, and update its host range. Lecanosticta species have now been recorded in 44 countries, mostly in the northern hemisphere. The type species, L. acicola, has increased its range in recent years, and is present in 24 out of the 26 European countries where data were available. Other species of Lecanosticta are largely restricted to Mexico and Central America, and recently Colombia.The geo-database records demonstrate that L. acicola tolerates a wide range of climates across the northern hemisphere, and indicate its potential to colonise Pinus spp. forests across large swathes of the Europe. Pre-liminary analyses suggest L. acicola could affect 62% of global Pinus species area by the end of this century, under climate change predictions.Although its host range appears slightly narrower than the similar Dothistroma species, Lecanosticta species were recorded on 70 host taxa, mostly Pinus spp., but including, Cedrus and Picea spp. Twenty-three, including species of critical ecological, environmental and economic significance in Europe, are highly susceptible to L. acicola, suffering heavy defoliation and sometimes mortality. Variation in apparent susceptibility between reports could reflect variation between regions in the hosts' genetic make-up, but could also reflect the signif-icant variation in L. acicola populations and lineages found across Europe. This study served to highlight sig-nificant gaps in our understanding of the pathogen's behaviour.Lecanosticta acicola has recently been downgraded from an A1 quarantine pest to a regulated non quarantine pathogen, and is now widely distributed across Europe.

"151","Climate change and impacts of boreal forest insects","Volney, W. J. A.; Fleming, R. A.","The circum-polar boreal forest has played an important role in the wealth of northern nations since the 15th century. Its natural resources spurred strategic geopolitical developments beginning in the 16th century but intense development of the boreal forest is largely limited to the 20th century. Insects cause considerable loss of wood that has an adverse effect on the balance of carbon sequestered by forests. Current understanding of processes that lead to stand-replacing outbreaks in three insect species is reviewed in this paper. Many of these processes depend on climate either directly, such as reduced survival with extreme weather events, or indirectly, mainly through effects on the host trees. In the boreal zone of Canada, pest-caused timber losses may be as much as 1.3-2.0 times the mean annual depletions due to fires. Pests are thus major, but consistently overlooked forest ecosystem components that have manifold consequences to the structure and functions of future forests. Global change will have demonstrable changes in the frequency and intensity of pest outbreaks, particularly at the margins of host ranges. The consequent shunting of carbon back to the atmosphere rather than to sequestration in forests as biomass is thought to have positive feedback to global warming. Whereas significant progress has been made in developing carbon budget models for the boreal forests of Canada, enormous problems remain in incorporating pest effects in these models. These problems have their origins in the nature of interactions among pests with forest productivity, and problems with scaling. The common problems of verification and validation of model results are particularly troublesome in projecting future forest productivity. The interaction of insects with fires must be accounted for if realistic carbon sequestration forecasts in a warming climate are to be made, These problems make assessments of mitigation and adaptation of pest management alternatives difficult to evaluate at present. Nevertheless, the impacts of stand-replacing insect population outbreaks is important in formulating future resource management policy. Crown Copyright (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

"152","Insect Declines in the Anthropocene","Wagner, D. L.; Douglas, A. E.","Insect declines are being reported worldwide for flying, ground, and aquatic lineages. Most reports come from western and northern Europe, where the insect fauna is well-studied and there are considerable demographic data for many taxonomically disparate lineages. Additional cases of faunal losses have been noted from Asia, North America, the Arctic, the Neotropics, and elsewhere. While this review addresses both species loss and population declines, its emphasis is on the latter. Declines of abundant species can be especially worrisome, given that they anchor trophic interactions and shoulder many of the essential ecosystem services of their respective communities. A review of the factors believed to be responsible for observed collapses and those perceived to be especially threatening to insects form the core of this treatment. In addition to widely recognized threats to insect biodiversity, e.g., habitat destruction, agricultural intensification (including pesticide use), climate change, and invasive species, this assessment highlights a few less commonly considered factors such as atmospheric nitrification from the burning of fossil fuels and the effects of droughts and changing precipitation patterns. Because the geographic extent and magnitude of insect declines are largely unknown, there is an urgent need for monitoring efforts, especially across ecological gradients, which will help to identify important causal factors in declines.

H.","Background West Nile virus (WNV), the most widely distributed flavivirus causing encephalitis globally, is a vector-borne pathogen of global importance. The changing climate is poised to reshape the landscape of various infectious diseases, particularly vector-borne ones like WNV. Understanding the anticipated geographical and range shifts in disease transmission due to climate change, alongside effective adaptation strategies, is critical for mitigating future public health impacts. This scoping review aims to consolidate evidence on the impact of climate change on WNV and to identify a spectrum of applicable adaptation strategies.Main body We systematically analyzed research articles from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCOhost. Our criteria included English-language research articles published between 2007 and 2023, focusing on the impacts of climate change on WNV and related adaptation strategies. We extracted data concerning study objectives, populations, geographical focus, and specific findings. Literature was categorized into two primary themes: 1) climate-WNV associations, and 2) climate change impacts on WNV transmission, providing a clear understanding. Out of 2168 articles reviewed, 120 met our criteria. Most evidence originated from North America (59.2%) and Europe (28.3%), with a primary focus on human cases (31.7%). Studies on climate-WNV correlations (n = 83) highlighted temperature (67.5%) as a pivotal climate factor. In the analysis of climate change impacts on WNV (n = 37), most evidence suggested that climate change may affect the transmission and distribution of WNV, with the extent of the impact depending on local and regional conditions. Although few studies directly addressed the implementation of adaptation strategies for climate-induced disease transmission, the proposed strategies (n = 49) fell into six categories: 1) surveillance and monitoring (38.8%), 2) predictive modeling (18.4%), 3) cross-disciplinary collaboration (16.3%), 4) environmental management (12.2%), 5) public education (8.2%), and 6) health system readiness (6.1%). Additionally, we developed an accessible online platform to summarize the evidence on climate change impacts on WNV transmission (https://2xzl2o-neaop.shinyapps.io/WNVScopingReview/).Conclusions This review reveals that climate change may affect the transmission and distribution of WNV, but the literature reflects only a small share of the global WNV dynamics. There is an urgent need for adaptive responses to anticipate and respond to the climate-driven spread of WNV. Nevertheless, studies focusing on these adaptation responses are sparse compared to those examining the impacts of climate change. Further research on the impacts of climate change and adaptation strategies for vector-borne diseases, along with more comprehensive evidence synthesis, is needed to inform effective policy responses tailored to local contexts.",2024,"MAY 24","Infectious Diseases of Poverty","13","1","","WOS:001232468700001","10.1186/s40249-024-01207-2","","#12836","Wang 2024","Dayo Osinubi (2024-08-29 05:27:22)(Select): This review focused on the impacts of climate change on West Nile Virus (WNV) globally and related adaptation strategies, with emphasis on climate‑WNV associations, and climate change impacts on WNV transmission.

E.; Flockhart, D. T. T.; Newman, A. E. M.; Norris, D. R.","The migratory monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) of eastern North America have undergone large-scale declines, which may be attributable to a variety of underlying causes. The uncertainty about the primary cause of declines and whether individual threats are likely to increase in the future presents challenges for developing effective conservation management and policy initiatives that aim to improve population viability. This paper identifies five potential threats and classifies these threats according to the types of studies (observational, experimental, simulation/models) and their current impact and anticipated risk. Broadly, the threats can be classified into five categories: (1) change in suitable abiotic environmental conditions; (2) deforestation in the overwintering range; (3) exposure to contaminants including the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis, herbicides, and insecticides; (4) loss of breeding habitat; and (5) predation, parasitism, and species-specific pathogens. The vast distribution of the monarch butterfly makes it likely that population declines are attributed to a suite of interacting factors that vary spatially and temporally in their contribution. Nonetheless, the published papers we reviewed suggest the decline in suitable environmental conditions in addition to overwintering (i.e., deforestation) and breeding habitat loss are the most likely threats to continue to affect the population viability of monarch butterflies.",2019,"APR 5","Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","7","","","WOS:000467430400001","10.3389/fevo.2019.00099","","#13138","Wilcox 2019","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Canada yew has a relatively unique growth form, with low sprawling branches capable of forming dense clusters of stems. Historic accounts suggest that before Euro-American settlement, Canada yew was a common plant across its range in many forest types and that it was locally abundant or dominant in 5%-20% of forest stands in the northern part of its range. Canada yew's range has declined during the last century as a result of browsing by native ungulates, fire, intensive forest management, and clearing of land for agriculture and other development. It is considered uncommon throughout most of its present North American range, except for often isolated populations in areas that remain free from heavy browsing pressure by moose and deer (e.g., islands, areas with heavy snow cover, or areas naturally low in ungulate abundance). Its decline has likely resulted in changes to abiotic and biotic conditions, including structure and composition of understory vegetation and concomitant effects on understory vertebrates. Increasing white-tailed deer populations and reduced snowfall as a result of climate change in eastern North America threaten to extirpate this species from additional parts of its range in the next century.

The fate of migratory birds has been a concern stimulating research over the past 40 years in response to population declines documented in long-term studies including those of the IITF and collaborators in Puerto Rico's Guanica dry forest. Various studies indicate that in addition to forest loss or fragmentation, some migrant declines may be due to rainfall variation, the consequences of which may carry over from one stage of a migrant's annual cycle to another. For example, the Guanica studies indicate that rainfall extremes on either the temperate breeding or tropical wintering grounds affect migrant abundance and survival differently depending on the species. In contrast, IITF's collaborative studies of the migrant Kirtland's Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) in the Bahamas found that late winter droughts affect its annual survival and breeding success in Michigan. We review these IITF migrant studies and relate them to other studies, which have improved our understanding of migrant ecology of relevance to conservation. Particularly important is the advent of the full annual cycle (FAC) approach.

In this context, we carried out a systematic review to synthesize the effects of climate change on honey bees and beekeeping activities. A total of 90 articles were identified, providing insight into potential impacts (negative, neutral, and positive) on honey bees and beekeeping. Interest in climate change's impact on honey bees has increased in the last decade, with studies mainly focusing on honey bee individuals, using empirical and experimental approaches, and performed at short-spatial (<10 km) and temporal (<5 years) scales. Moreover, environmental analyses were mainly based on short-term data (weather) and concentrated on only a few countries. Environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind were widely studied and had generalized negative effects on different biological and ecological aspects of honey bees. Food reserves, plant-pollinator networks, mortality, gene expression, and metabolism were negatively impacted. Knowledge gaps included a lack of studies at the apiary and beekeeper level, a limited number of predictive and perception studies, poor representation of large-spatial and mid-term scales, a lack of climate analysis, and a poor understanding of the potential impacts of pests and diseases. Finally, climate change's impacts on global beekeeping are still an emergent issue. This is mainly due to their diverse effects on honey bees and the potential necessity of implementing adaptation measures to sustain this activity under complex environmental scenarios.",2024,"MAR","Global Change Biology","30","3","","WOS:001180804300001","10.1111/gcb.17219","","#13708","Zapata-Hernández 2024","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"159","The ecological niche of Echinococcus multilocularis in North America: understanding biotic and abiotic determinants of parasite distribution with new records in New Mexico and Maryland, United States","Botero-Cañola, Sebastian; Dursahinhan, Altangerel T.; Rácz, Sara E.; Lowe, Parker V.; Ubelaker, John E.; Gardner, Scott L.","Abstract: Understanding the factors shaping the niche of parasites and its expression over geographical space and through time continues to be a modern scientific challenge with the results of research in this area directly influencing both theoretical and applied biology. This is especially important for proactive management of zoonotic parasites such as Echinococcus multilocularis, the etiologic agent of alveolar echinococcosis. Echinococcus multilocularis has a Holarctic distribution; with its geographic range and prevalence increasing recently in areas of the western Palearctic, while its distribution dynamics are poorly understood in the Nearctic. In this paper, we use an ecological niche modeling (ENM) approach to: i) estimate the current spatial distribution of suitable conditions for the parasite in the Nearctic. ii) Evaluate the abiotic and biotic factors influencing the species distribution. iii) Assess the potential impact of climatic change on the distribution of this species in the Nearctic. Additionally, we report two new occurrence records of this parasite that significantly expands its known geographic range. We reviewed the occurrence records of E. multilocularis for the Nearctic. This was complemented by two new records of the species from Maryland and New Mexico identified using morphology and multivariate morphometrics of the rostellar hooks. From these data we created two ENMs using the software Maxent. The first ENM included climatic variables, while the second included the same abiotic data plus biotic information consisting of four host community-related data sets. We evaluated model performance and variable importance to explore the relation of these variables to the parasite niche. Finally, we projected the resulting niche model onto future climate change scenarios. We found that an important portion of the Nearctic has suitable conditions for E. multilocularis with adequate habitat in the West and East of the continent where the parasite has not been detected. We also found that the proposed biotic variables improve the model performance and provide unique information, while the most critical abiotic variable was related to the amount of solar radiation. Finally, under the future emission scenarios explored, the distribution of suitable habitat for the parasite is predicted to increase by 56 % to 76 %. We obtained a robust model that provides detail on the distribution of suitable areas for E. multilocularis, including areas that have not been explored for the presence of the parasite. The host community variables included in this study seem a promising way to include biotic data for ecological parasite niche modeling.",2019,"","Therya","10","2","91-102","SCIELO:S2007-33642019000200091","10.12933/therya-19-749","","#14067","Botero-Cañola 2019","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-08 09:48:42)(Included): this paper combines literature review with modeling, gray area whether this meets the criteria of being a review but erring on the side of inclusivity; ","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

It is imperative that accurate baselines in distribution and range are used to measure changes in the behavior of marine animals that occur in response to climate change. Current knowledge on the migratory movement of the blacktip shark, Carcharhinus limbatus, off the United States East Coast is challenged by inconsistent reports. Published data on the migration and sexual segregation of the U.S. East Coast blacktip shark population can be interpreted a variety of ways and the scientific literature continues to perpetuate historical and uncertain observations on this population derived from the older literature, which carries low certainty. Here, we provide an overview of the biology and life history of the blacktip shark, consolidate the migratory pattern of the species off the U.S. East Coast, and then critically dissect the many inconsistencies perpetuated in the literature. We argue that (1) blacktip sharks that inhabit the Florida Keys may belong to the Gulf of Mexico stock, (2) the currently accepted northern extent of this species (Massachusetts) may be inaccurate, and (3) that environmental variability and/or sexual segregation of this population may play a role in the inconsistent reports.

Bradley; Jensen, Paul G.; Fisher, Jason T.","Competition is a major determinant of where species occur and how species interact. Among carnivorans, interspecific competition is particularly apparent, as many of these species have evolved to be efficient killers. Theoretically, phylogenetically related carnivorans that occupy seasonal habitats, share common resources, and differ in body size by a factor of 2.5-10x should exhibit the most interference competition. Fishers Pekania pennanti and martens Martes americana and Martes caurina are members of the subfamily Guloninae (Mustelidae, Carnivora) that occupy forests throughout northern North America. These taxa occur sympatrically throughout much of their range, utilise similar habitats, and consume similar prey; fishers and martens also differ in body size by a factor 2-5x. Consequently, these two taxa appear to be locked in particularly strong interspecific competition and should attempt to limit competitive overlap. We review the current knowledge of this dyadic interaction in the framework of ecological niches and niche partitioning. In particular, we explore the three critical niche axes of diet, space, and time. We found that, in contrast to the traditional view of them being highly specialised, both martens and fishers are dietary generalists; however, they also appear to be specialists in complexity, at least in space and habitats. Collectively, martens and fishers exhibit high degrees of diet and habitat niche overlap across their ranges, and this overlap is likely to have the greatest fitness consequences for the smaller and subordinate martens. Nevertheless, fine-scale habitat and prey partitioning, and especially partitioning along snow clines, seem to be the mechanisms by which these two taxa can coexist. We predict that rapid ecological change - especially from increasingly homogenised forests and prey communities, as well as from declining snow cover and snowpack due to climate warming - is likely to destabilise marten-fisher coexistence. As the climate continues to change, fishers and martens are likely to experience distributional and numerical shifts and increased isolation at their southern range boundaries, and vulnerable populations - especially of martens - will be driven to local extirpation.

"163","Synopsis of global fresh and brackish water occurrences of the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas Valenciennes, 1839 (Pisces: Carcharhinidae), with comments on distribution and habitat use","Gausmann, Peter","The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas Valenciennes, 1839) is a large, primarily coastally distributed shark famous for its ability to penetrate far into freshwater bodies in tropical, subtropical, and warm-temperate climates. It is a cosmopolitan species with a geographical range that includes the coastlines of all major ocean basins (Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean). As a consequence, freshwater occurrences of C. leucas are possible everywhere inside its geographic range. Carcharhinus leucas is a fully euryhaline, amphidromous species and possibly the widest-ranging of all freshwater tolerating elasmobranchs. This species is found not only in river systems with sea access that are not interrupted by human impediments but in hypersaline lakes as well. Rivers and estuaries are believed to be important nursery grounds for C. leucas, as suggested by observations of pregnant females in estuaries and neonates with umbilical scars in rivers and river mouths. Due to the physical capability of this species to enter riverine systems, the documentation of its occurrence in fresh and brackish water is essential for future conservation plans, fishery inspections, and scientific studies that focus on the link between low salinity habitats, shark nurseries, and feeding areas. The author's review of the available literature on C. leucas revealed the absence of a comprehensive overview of fresh and brackish water localities (rivers and associated lakes, estuaries) with C. leucas records. The purpose of this literature review is to provide a global list of rivers, river systems, lakes, estuaries, and lagoons with records and reports of this species, including a link to the used references as a base for regional, national, and international conservation strategies. Therefore, the objective of this work is to present lists of fresh and brackish water habitats with records of C. leucas as the result of an extensive literature review and analysis of databases. This survey also took into account estuaries and lagoons, regarding their function as important nursery grounds for C. leucas. The analysis of references included is not only from the scientific literature, but also includes semi-scientific references and the common press if reliable. The result of 415 global fresh and brackish water localities with evidence of C. leucas highlights the importance of these habitats for the reproduction of this species. Moreover, gaps in available distribution maps are critically discussed as well as interpretations and conclusions made regarding possible reasons for the distribution range of C. leucas, which can be interpreted as the result of geographic circumstances, but also as a result of the current state of knowledge about the distribution of this species. The results of the examination of available references were used to build a reliable and updated distribution map for C. leucas, which is also presented here.",2021,"/","Stuttgarter Beitrage zur Naturkunde.","4","1","55-213","","10.18476/2021.423083","IND607619000","#14564","Gausmann 2021","Colleen Miller (2024-08-29 04:57:51)(Select): notes transboundary populations; northward shifts in range due to cc;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

According to this systematic review, undertaken according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 19 tick species are known to carry Borrelia burgdorferi, with more than half of the recorded cases in the last two decades related to Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes scapularis ticks. Forty-six studies from four continents, Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa, reported this pathogen in ticks collected from vegetation, animals, and humans. This study highlights an increasing distribution of tick-associated Borrelia burgdorferi, likely driven by accelerated tick population increases in response to climate change coupled with tick dispersal via migratory birds.

The influence of these nonrandom changes in species distributions could profoundly affect the functioning of ecosystems and the essential services that they provide. However, few experimental tests have been conducted examining the influence of species invasions on ecosystem functioning. Even fewer have been conducted using invasive ecosystem engineers, which can have disproportionately strong influence on native ecosystems relative to their own biomass. The invasion of exotic earthworms is a prime example of an ecosystem engineer that is influencing many ecosystems around the world. In particular, European earthworm invasions of northern North American forests cause simultaneous species gains and losses with significant consequences for essential ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling and crucial services to humanity like soil erosion control and carbon sequestration. Exotic earthworms are expected to select for specific traits in communities of soil microorganisms (fast-growing bacteria species), soil fauna (promoting the bacterial energy channel), and plants (graminoids) through direct and indirect effects. This will accelerate some ecosystem processes and decelerate others, fundamentally altering how invaded forests function. This project aims to investigate ecosystem responses of northern North American forests to earthworm invasion. Using a novel, synthetic combination of field observations, field experiments, lab experiments, and meta-analyses, the proposed work will be the first systematic examination of earthworm effects on (1) plant communities and (2) soil food webs and processes. Further, (3) effects of a changing climate (warming and reduced summer precipitation) on earthworm performance will be investigated in a unique field experiment designed to predict the future spread and consequences of earthworm invasion in North America. By assessing the soil chemical and physical properties as well as the taxonomic (e.g., by the latest next-generation sequencing techniques) and functional composition of plant, soil microbial and animal communities and the processes they drive in four forests, work packages I-III take complementary approaches to derive a comprehensive and generalizable picture of how ecosystems change in response to earthworm invasion. Finally, in work package IV, meta-analyses will be used to integrate the information from work packages I-III and existing literature to investigate if earthworms cause invasion waves, invasion meltdowns, habitat homogenization, and ecosystem state shifts. Global data will be synthesized to test if the relative magnitude of effects differs from place to place depending on the functional dissimilarity between native soil fauna and exotic earthworms. Moving from local to global scale, the present proposal examines the influence of earthworm invasions on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships from an aboveground-belowground perspective in natural settings. This approach is highly innovative as it utilizes the invasion by exotic earthworms as an exciting model system that links invasion biology with trait-based community ecology, global change research, and ecosystem ecology, pioneering a new generation of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research.

This mosquito, similar to other Stegomyia species such as Aedes aegypti (L.), is highly adapted to urban and suburban areas, and commonly oviposits in artificial containers, which are ubiquitous in these peridomestic environments. The increase in speed and amount of international travel and commerce, coupled with global climate change, have aided in the resurgence and expansion of Stegomyia species into new areas of North America. In many parts of their range, both species are implicated as significant vectors of emerging and re-emerging arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and now Zika. Although rapid and major advances have been made in the field of biology, ecology, genetics, taxonomy, and virology, relatively little has changed in the field of mosquito control in recent decades. This is particularly discouraging in regards to container-inhabiting mosquitoes, because traditional integrated mosquito management (IMM) approaches have not been effective against these species. Many mosquito control programs simply do not possess the man-power or necessary financial resources needed to suppress Ae. albopictus effectively. Therefore, control of mosquito larvae, which is the foundation of IMM approaches, is exceptionally difficult over large areas. This review paper addresses larval habitats, use of geographic information systems for habitat preference detection, door-to-door control efforts, source reduction, direct application of larvicides, biological control agents, area-wide low-volume application of larvicides, hot spot treatments, autodissemination stations, public education, adult traps, attractive-toxic sugar bait methods, lethal ovitraps, barrier-residual adulticides, hand-held ultra-low-volume adulticides, area-wide adulticides applied by ground or air, and genetic control methods.

In this paper, we discuss ecological patterns and processes in roadside habitats important for understanding the invasion dynamics of common reed from coastal areas inland. Frequent disturbances in roadsides combined with potentially high levels of nutrients from adjacent land and stress conditions (from deicing salt and other pollutants) mimic the conditions unfortunately found more and more in natural wetlands. The novel contribution of roads is the creation of linear wetlands with an unprecedented level of connectivity. Genetic evidence shows that invasion inland coincides with the intensification of the road network. Time series analysis of remote sensing data reveals impressive rates of invasion of roadsides and other linear infrastructures, suggesting prime conditions for common reed in these novel habitats. Whereas reed dispersal along roads was thought to be largely due to rhizome transport, new evidence suggests a significant contribution of sexual reproduction and seedling establishment, likely enhanced by climate warming at northern latitudes. There is little evidence that other wetland plants can slow down vegetative expansion of common reed in roadside habitats, but plant cover could prevent seedling establishment and shading by shrubs and trees limit lateral clonal expansion. The fact that common reed possibly provides water treatment and other ecosystem services in roadsides must be carefully weighed against the threat to biodiversity in natural systems. All this begs for investigating urgently if, where, and how we should intervene without compromising the great value of wetlands of conservation interest intersected by roads.",2010,"/","Invasive plant science and management.","3","4","506-514","","10.1614/IPSM-09-050.1","IND44475723","#15378","Brisson 2010","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Bark beetles are major natural disturbance agents in western North American forests. However, recent bark beetle population eruptions have exceeded the frequencies, impacts, and ranges documented during the previous 125 years. Extensive host abundance and susceptibility, concentrated beetle density, favorable weather, optimal symbiotic associations, and escape from natural enemies must occur jointly for beetles to surpass a series of thresholds and exert widespread disturbance. Opposing feedbacks determine qualitatively distinct outcomes at junctures at the biochemical through landscape levels. Eruptions occur when key thresholds are surpassed, prior constraints cease to exert influence, and positive feedbacks amplify across scales. These dynamics are bidirectional, as landscape features influence how lower-scale processes are amplified or buffered.

A doubling of CO2 from pre-industrial levels is expected to occur within 80 yr. Increased CO2 may increase average summer temperatures in Ontario between 3 and 6 degrees C, with the largest increases in NW and S. Ontario. Precipitation is predicted to increase in NE Ontario, but to decrease in S. and NW Ontario. An increase in summer temperatures with no or little increase in precipitation would increase the frequency and severity of drought by increasing evapotranspiration. Also, extreme weather events and variation in weather are expected to increase. The length of the forest fire season is expected to increase with longer growing seasons, and increased moisture loss from forests due to increased temperatures would increase forest fire frequency and severity. Increases in drought stress could also increase the frequency of major forest insect and disease outbreaks. Increases in forest fires, insect outbreaks and diseases would, in turn, alter the age structure and species in forest ecosystems, with the greatest impacts expected in NW and S. Ontario. Extreme weather events could further damage or stress plants. Increased CO2, drought, and temperature will affect the growth and survival of plants by altering their physiological behaviour. The genetic structure of plant populations may be affected by altered selection pressures, and species with larger genetic variability are likely to be more adaptable to changed climatic conditions and may be more successful. Competitive abilities of plant species now present in Ontario's forests may change, with some species becoming more competitive and others less so. Productivity and timber supply in NW and S. Ontario may decline due to increases in drought, forest fires, insects and disease, although this may be partially offset by increases in growth rates accompanying higher CO2 levels, warmer temperatures, and a longer growing season. Increases in precipitation in NE Ontario along with higher CO2 levels, increased temperatures and longer growing season could significantly increase productivity and timber supply. Over hundreds of years, plant species may migrate northward. Differing migration rates and the species' reactions to new environmental conditions could result in new plant species mixes for which forest management experience is lacking. However, forest management through changed silvicultural and harvesting practices could reduce the impacts of climatic change to forests. Climatic adaptation could also be increased through tree breeding, and carbon sequestration could become a goal of forest management.",1998,"","Forest Research Information Paper - Ontario Forest Research Institute","","143","v-pp","","","","#15705","Colombo 1998","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-09-01 00:51:18)(Select): study is geographically focused on Ontario but discusses some transboundary locations like the Great Lakes system that could be relevant to the chapter ;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This paper reviews existing impacts, projected impacts, and management options for Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock) forests in US national parks threatened by the introduced insect Adelges tsugae (Hemlock Woolly Adelgid [HWA]). Eighty-five national parks, or 21% of all parks in the US national park system, are encompassed within the range of Eastern Hemlock. These 85 parks include iconic areas such as national battlefields and the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. Four focal parks of this study - Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Shenandoah National Park, and New River Gorge National River - are collectively visited by 16 million people annually and Eastern Hemlock is a forest component in 2-26% of their area. Results of research on HWA impacts to forest species composition, soil nutrient cycling, watersheds and fisheries, wildlife habitat, and visitor experiences and safety have already been reported from these parks. A general principle is that after Eastern Hemlock forest decline, some species (e.g., some avian species favoring other tree species) benefit, while those associated with Eastern Hemlock must adapt or decline. Forecasting future forest-tree composition is complicated by the fact that: (i) many possible replacement tree species are themselves threatened by introduced damaging agents, (ii) changes hinge upon understory dynamics such as invading exotic plants or expansion of native shrubs, and (iii) this die-off event is occurring within a context of multiple interacting factors such as elevated herbivory, climate change, and atmospheric pollution. Some management strategies for parks include: intensive HWA chemical treatment at priority sites, biocontrol, genetic manipulation for HWA resistance in Eastern Hemlock, exotic plant treatment, facilitated establishment of native vegetation, or doing nothing, the last of which also is likely to result in appreciable forest change.

The apparent emergence of this fungus in another temperate area, this time in the Pacific Northwest, suggests the fungus may have expanded its ecological niche. Yet studies that directly examine the potential roles of climatic and land use changes on C. gattii are still lacking. We aim to summarize the existing global literature on the ecology of C. gattii, with particular focus on the gap in knowledge surrounding the potential effects of climatic and land use changes. We systematically reviewed English peer-reviewed literature on the ecological determinants of C. gattii. We included studies published from January 1970 through June 2016 and identified 56 relevant studies for our review. We identified environmental isolations of C. gattii from 18 countries, spanning 72 separate regions across six continents. Fifty-three tree species were associated with C. gattii, spanning 10 climate classifications and 36 terrestrial ecoregions. No studies directly tested the potential effects of climatic changes (including climatic oscillations and global climate change) on C. gattii, while only one study directly assessed those of land use change. To improve model predictions of current and future distributions of C. gattii, more focus is needed on the potential effects of climatic and land use changes to help decrease the public health risk.

While the responses of insects to these changes have been increasingly studied, our understanding of how such alterations impact trophic interactions still requires further research to make reliable predictions about the spread of diseases in a warming world. Phytoplasmas, a group of obligate parasitic unculturable Mollicutes, primarily rely on leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) for transmission, spread, and survival. Phytoplasmas are associated with over 600 diseases affecting more than 1,000 plant species, including berries, grapevines, and other small fruits. In North America, diseases such as grapevine yellows, blueberry stunt, and strawberry green petal diseases have been linked to phytoplasma strains transmitted by known leafhopper species. However, the number of phytoplasma diseases has significantly increased in North America over the past decade, suggesting the presence of unidentified vectors or an abundance of leafhopper vectors. This short review provides an overview of the current knowledge on leafhoppers as vectors of phytoplasmas to berries, focusing on the last decade's research in Canada. This paper also explores the potential implications of climate change on this pathosystem, including the anticipated range expansion of leafhopper species, changes in phytoplasma acquisition and transmission, and the risk of new leafhopper-transmitted plant-pathogen introductions through the arrival of new leafhopper species.",2023,"","Annals of the Entomological Society of America","117","1","14-20","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/saad038","","#16054","AlmeidaSantos 2023","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This paper reviews the scientific literature on the impacts of climate change on yield variance and investigates their implications for the demand of crop insurance and effectiveness of different farm strategies and policy measures using crop farm data in Australia, Canada and Spain. A microeconomic farm level model is calibrated to different types of farms and used to simulate the responses and impacts of four policy measures: ex post disaster payments and three types of crop insurance (individual yields, area-based yield and weather index). The strong uncertainties about climate change are captured in a set of seven scenarios covering different assumptions about the scope of climate change (no change, marginal change, and high occurrence of extreme events), and farmers' adaptation response (no adaptation, diversification, and structural adaptation). Policy decision making under these uncertainties is analysed using a standard Bayesian probabilistic approach, but also using other criteria that look for robust second best choices (MaxiMin and Satisficing criteria).",2012,"","OECD Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Working Papers","","58","88-pp","","","","#16172","Anton 2012","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

V.","Quercus species (oaks) have been an integral part of the landscape in the northern hemisphere for millions of years. Their ability to adapt and spread across different environments and their contributions to many ecosystem services is well documented. Human activity has placed many oak species in peril by eliminating or adversely modifying habitats through exploitative land usage and by practices that have exacerbated climate change. The goal of this review is to compile a list of oak species of conservation concern, evaluate the genetic data that is available for these species, and to highlight the gaps that exist. We compiled a list of 124 Oaks of Concern based on the Red List of Oaks 2020 and the Conservation Gap Analysis for Native U.S. Oaks and their evaluations of each species. Of these, 57% have been the subject of some genetic analysis, but for most threatened species (72%), the only genetic analysis was done as part of a phylogenetic study. While nearly half (49%) of published genetic studies involved population genetic analysis, only 16 species of concern (13%) have been the subject of these studies. This is a critical gap considering that analysis of intraspecific genetic variability and genetic structure are essential for designing conservation management strategies. We review the published population genetic studies to highlight their application to conservation.

R.","Ecosystems across the United States are changing in complex and unpredictable ways and analysis of these changes requires coordinated, long-term research. This paper is a product of a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation funded Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network addressing the LTER core research area of """"populations and communities."""" This analysis revealed that each LTER site had at least one compelling """"story"""" about what their site would look like in 50-100 yr. As the stories were prepared, themes emerged, and the stories were group into papers along five themes: state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects. This paper addresses the cascading effects theme and includes stories from the Bonanza Creek (boreal), Kellogg Biological Station (agricultural and freshwater), Palmer (Antarctica), and Harvard Forest (temperate forest) LTER sites. We define cascading effects very broadly to include a wide array of unforeseen chains of events that result from a variety of actions or changes in a system. While climate change is having important direct effects on boreal forests, indirect effects mediated by fire activity-severity, size, and return interval-have large cascading effects over the long term. In northeastern temperate forests, legacies of human management and disturbance affect the composition of current forests, which creates a cascade of effects that interact with the climate-facilitated invasion of an exotic pest. In Antarctica, declining sea ice creates a cascade of effects including declines in Adelie and increases in Gentoo penguins, changes in phytoplankton, and consequent changes in zooplankton populations. An invasion of an exotic species of lady beetle is likely to have important future effects on pest control and conservation of native species in agricultural landscapes. New studies of zebra mussels, a well-studied invader, have established links between climate, the heat tolerance of the mussels, and harmful algal blooms. Collectively, these stories highlight the need for long-term studies to sort out the complexities of different types of ecological cascades. The diversity of sites within the LTER network facilitates the emergence of overarching concepts about trophic interactions as an important driver of ecosystem structure, function, services, and futures.",2021,"","Special Feature: Forecasting Earth's ecosystems with long-term ecological research.","12","5","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3430","","#16356","Bahlai 2021","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

We compiled E. fabae arrival dates and infestation severity data at different states in USA from existing literature reviews and agricultural extension records from 1951-2012, and examined the influence of temperature anomalies at each target state or overwintering range on the date of arrival and severity of infestation. Average E. fabae arrival date at different states reveal a clear trend along the south-north axis, with earliest arrival closest to the overwintering range. E. fabae arrival has advanced by 10 days over the last 62 years. E. fabae arrived earlier in warmer years in relation to each target state level temperature anomaly (3.0 days/ degrees C increase in temperature anomaly). Increased temperature had a significant and positive effect on the severity of infestation, and arrival date had a marginal negative effect on severity.

As temperatures increase in Canada, the environment becomes more suitable for ticks and the season suitable for tick activity lengthens, so tick-borne diseases are likely to become more common in Canada. In addition to Lyme disease, four other tick-borne diseases (TBDs) have started to emerge and are likely to increase: Anaplasmosis; Babesiosis; Powassan virus; and Borrelia miyamotoi disease. Increased temperature increases the survival and activity period of ticks, increases the range of both reservoir and tick hosts (e.g. mice and deer) and increases the duration of the season when people may be exposed to ticks. Other ticks and TBDs may spread into Canada as the climate changes.

The Canadian health burden from waterborne illness is unknown, although it presumably accounts for a significant proportion of enteric illness. Recently, large outbreaks with severe consequences produced by Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Cryptosporidium have alarmed Canadians and brought demands for political action. A concurrent need to understand the health impacts of global climate changes and to develop strategies to prevent or prepare for these has also been recognized. There is mounting evidence that weather is often a factor in triggering waterborne disease outbreaks. A recent study of precipitation and waterborne illness in the United States found that more than half the waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States during the last half century followed a period of extreme rainfall. Projections of international global climate change scenarios suggest that, under conditions of global warming most of Canada may expect longer summers, milder winters, increased summer drought, and more extreme precipitation. Excess precipitation, floods, high temperatures, and drought could affect the risk of waterborne illness in Canada. The existing scientific information regarding most weather-related adverse health impacts and on the impacts of global climate change on health in Canada is insufficient for informed decision making.

Billions of birds migrate to and from the boreal region and reproduce in the short boreal summers, largely because of the region's abundant wetlands and undammed waterways. The prodigious number of insects hatched from the water, and creatures living in it, are staples of birds' diets. This watery habitat provides shelter and nesting grounds as well as food for migrants. It has also, until recently, contributed to keeping industrial development in check. But the boreal forest is under pressure from industrial development and climate change. Hydropower has flooded former habitat, while logging and industry such as tar sands oil extraction, strip-mining, and drilling operations have impacted forest habitat and decreased water quality. Climate change is melting permafrost, desiccating wetlands, and potentially creating ecological imbalances that could undermine the land's ability to support the large percentage of the world's bird populations that depend on the boreal forest.

S.","Several studies in the North Pacific Ocean have documented the consequences of rising sea surface temperatures and the advancement of the spring freshet on ocean productivity. The altering of ocean productivity has also been correlated with changes in the marine survival and geographic occurrence of some Pacific salmon populations. Knowledge of the marine survival and position of salmon in the Pacific Ocean are derived typically from mark-recapture studies. As a result, the migratory behaviour and associated survival estimates of salmon in real time are not known. Major information gaps also exist in terms of stock-specific marine behaviour and survival - especially as they relate to recent changes in climate. Acoustic telemetry and other modern tools enable researchers to answer specific questions about environmental, physiological, and genetic effects on individual salmon survival and behaviour, which had not been possible previously. As climate trends increasingly exceed those found in historical records, there is an urgent need for information that will improve fishery management and conservation decisions.

In the last decades, climate change and its related environmental disturbances have favored the appearance of disease outbreaks caused by plant pathogenic microorganisms. In this context, several root-inhabiting Phytophthora species have emerged as causal agents of """"catastrophic tree mortality"""". A robust body of scientific literature supports the hypothesis for the convergence between Phytophthora and predisposing environmental conditions as warm temperatures, flooding, and drought to establish the optimal conditions for the pathogen proliferation and infection. Due to the climatic alterations and bad agricultural and silvicultural practices tree decline and mortality in extensive zones of forests localized at the Boreal region of America, Asia and Europe, and in Oceania have been observed. Because of global climate change trees have been forced to migrate towards new geographical sites, which in the presence of exotic Phytophthora species have favored the emergence of this pathogen and its outbreaks. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to establish international protocols to avoid pathogen propagation to new sites. In this review, we integrated and discussed state of the art information about the environmental traits and microbial factors that induce forest decline and subsequent tree mortality. Further research directions in the field of Phytophthora - plant interactions with special emphasis on the biochemical and molecular signals involved in pathogen virulence and host defense are suggested.

T.; Hik, D.; Kulkarni, T.; Lewis, G.","Some of the most rapidly changing ecosystems on our planet are located in the polar regions (IPCC 2007; Turner et al. 2009; SWIPA 2011). In some areas of the Arctic and Antarctic, atmospheric temperatures are rising at rates more than double the global average. In addition, there are other direct human impacts on polar regions such as pollution, exploitation and development. Polar ecosystems and the biodiversity they support are already responding to this change and it is expected that even more profound impacts will occur this century. Compounding the risk to polar biodiversity is the fact that many polar ecosystems have limited functional redundancy; in the event of the loss of a single keystone species, they may potentially be exposed to cascading effects and complete ecosystem restructuring (Post et al. 2009). Rapid climate change affecting the polar regions will also have profound physical and ecological consequences for the rest of the planet since the ice-covered Arctic Ocean, the Antarctic continent, and the globally significant Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) serve a key role in regulating the Earth's climate and ocean systems. This special issue is intended to provide an overview of circumpolar change that crosses disciplines, systems, taxonomic groups and regions, and integrates papers that address a range of topics including: the monitoring of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial organisms in both the northern and southern polar regions, the role of protected areas in monitoring change in a warming world, polar resource management and development, impacts on northern indigenous peoples, case studies of the biodiversity of selected polar organisms, impacts of sea ice loss on terrestrial and marine organisms and ecosystems, interconnections with lower latitudes, and the influence of historical processes that have impacted polar diversity.

M.","Species conservation often faces many challenges, such as addressing threats from multiple stressor sources, representing under-studied taxa, and understanding implications of spatial extent. To overcome these challenges, we assessed contemporary anthropogenic threats from stream fragmentation and landscape disturbance as well as future habitat suitability under climate change for traditionally well-studied (fishes) and under-studied (mussels) imperiled fluvial taxa in Michigan, USA. To understand how threats to species vary spatially, predicted habitat suitability was analyzed for three hierarchically nested spatial extents: statewide, within species' biogeographic ranges, and within river patches fragmented by barriers. Comparison of current and future habitat suitability for 27 fish and 23 mussel species indicates large potential statewide gains for many warmwater and/or large river fishes and several mussel species, however these gains are greatly diminished by biogeographic range limitations and habitat fragmentation among current and future habitats. One mussel species and several cold- and coolwater fishes are projected to have significant habitat losses under climate change irrespective of spatial extent. On average, 79% of habitats for mussels and 58% for fishes were considered moderately to severely disturbed from current human landscape activities. Habitat fragmentation was greater for fishes than mussels, with large dams playing a primary role in fragmenting habitats relative to small dams and waterfalls. Results indicate that threat assessments can vary substantially according to spatial extent and taxa, and consideration of both contemporary and future threats to habitats is needed to inform conservation of imperiled fluvial organisms.",2022,"","Water","14","21","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14213464","","#17481","Cooper 2022","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

M.","The effects of water level fluctuations on fish and other aquatic biota, with an emphasis on winter water withdrawal in northern regions is reviewed. Water demands for population growth and development are adding pressure on water reserves, particularly when coupled with changing climatic conditions. Water level fluctuations can have adverse effects on the environment, most notably to hydrologic and biotic processes ranging in magnitude from the micro-scale to landscape level. Water level management of lakes and reservoirs can affect all forms of aquatic biota. The severity of effect is dependant on the magnitude, duration and timing of the fluctuation, and the species exposed. In northwestern Canada and northern Alaska, water is withdrawn from water bodies to construct ice-roads and other winter based developments. Biota in small, isolated water bodies are particularly sensitive to reductions in winter water levels. Water withdrawals can reduce the oxygen available to overwintering fish, while reduced water levels can reduce habitat for fish and furbearers, and freeze littoral areas killing plants, invertebrates, and fish eggs. Regulatory winter water withdrawal thresholds have been developed in the Northwest Territories and Alaska and continue to be refined as new data becomes available. The use of thresholds can help minimize or avoid negative impacts to the environment, particularly fish, from winter water withdrawal activities. Many different factors may influence the effect that winter water withdrawal has on a water body, such as basin shape, substrate and location. More research is warranted to better understand the linkages between anthropogenic and natural water level fluctuations and their combined effect on aquatic ecosystems.

Several scenarios can be predicted, however: local extinctions will occur; the endangered species status as well as the pest status of some insect species will change; geographic distributions for some insect species will shift with host-plant ranges; and changes in the population dynamics of affected insect species will influence their interactions with other insects and plants. An analysis of the available literature indicates that many orders containing insect species important for ecosystem conservation, and even those important as agricultural or medical pests, have not been examined in terms of the effect of enhanced CO2 levels on populations.

S.; Ryan, J.","More than 120 native bee species have been documented in Maine since 1930 in association with the native plant Vaccinium angustifolium (Lowbush Blueberry). We report 3 studies in commercial Lowbush Blueberry fields: (1) a survey of diversity in Osmia (mason bees) and closely related Megachile (leaf-cutter bees) using trap nests in 93 fields from 1990 to 2012, (2) a 29-year study of a native bee community, and (3) an examination of climate-change effects on bee-foraging periods during blueberry bloom. Osmia appeared to be more stable over a 22-year period in their species richness and relative abundances in Lowbush Blueberry fields when compared to Megachile over a similar 17-year period. The native bee community in a single location in Winterport was observed to fluctuate in abundance 2 to 3 times annually. Modeling of the total bee community and taxa-specific group abundances (Bombus, Megachilids, Andrenids, and Halictids and other bees) suggest that while stochastic density-independent processes such as weather can play a role in determining their annual oscillations, density-dependent lags of 1 and 2 years appear to be the main driving forces. Estimation of fruit set over the same 29-year period, based upon native bee abundance, suggests that pollination is more buffered than community bee abundance, resulting in a lesser degree of fluctuation over time. We speculate that this finding is due to redundancy in floral preferences, multiple floral visitations, and differing pollination efficiencies by the highly diverse native bee community associated with Lowbush Blueberry. Effects of climate change in Maine Lowbush Blueberry fields during May bloom was investigated using a historic weather database. Since the early 1990s, precipitation has, to a large degree, reduced the number of optimal bee foraging days during bloom, with implications for pollination and bee species abundances.

Aims: In this study, we aimed to determine whether the ecological performance of an epiphytic lichen is related to coarse-grained macroclimate. Methods: A meta-analysis was carried out to compare local growth rates for a lichen epiphyte, Lobaria pulmonaria, to coarse-grained interpolated climate surfaces. Growth rates were sampled from small-scale experiments conducted within different forest settings and for different regions of the world. Generalised linear mixed models were used to compare thallus growth (response) to a suite of climatic variables derived from the WorldClim dataset. Results: A significant relationship between thallus growth measured for experimental forest microhabitats and macroclimatic variables (total precipitation and annual mean temperature) was found. This relationship was validated through a comparison with L. pulmonaria's North American range for which projected growth rates were higher and lower where the species tended to be present and absent, respectively.

J.; Eisen, L.","Ixodes scapularis (the blacklegged tick) is widely distributed in forested areas across the eastern United States. The public health impact of I. scapularis is greatest in the north, where nymphal stage ticks commonly bite humans and serve as primary vectors for multiple human pathogens. There were dramatic increases in the tick's distribution and abundance over the last half-century in the northern part of the eastern US, and climate warming is commonly mentioned as a primary driver for these changes. In this review, we summarize the evidence for the observed spread and proliferation of I. scapularis being driven by climate warming. Although laboratory and small-scale field studies have provided insights into how temperature and humidity impact survival and reproduction of I. scapularis, using these associations to predict broad-scale distribution and abundance patterns is more challenging. Numerous efforts have been undertaken to model the distribution and abundance of I. scapularis at state, regional, and global scales based on climate and landscape variables, but outcomes have been ambiguous. Across the models, the functional relationships between seasonal or annual measures of heat, cold, precipitation, or humidity and tick presence or abundance were inconsistent. The contribution of climate relative to landscape variables was poorly defined. Over the last half-century, climate warming occurred in parallel with spread and population increase of the white-tailed deer, the most important reproductive host for I. scapularis adults, in the northern part of the eastern US. There is strong evidence for white-tailed deer playing a key role to facilitate spread and proliferation of I. scapularis in the US over the last century. However, due to a lack of spatially and temporally congruent data, climate, landscape, and host variables are rarely included in the same models, thus limiting the ability to evaluate their relative contributions or interactions in defining the geographic range and abundance patterns of ticks. We conclude that the role of climate change as a key driver for geographic expansion and population increase of I. scapularis in the northern part of the eastern US over the last half-century remains uncertain.",2024,"","Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases","15","1","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2023.102286","","#18015","Eisen 2024","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Increasing international travel, the globalisation of trade, and climate change are likely to play a progressively more important role in the introduction, establishment and spread of arthropod-borne pathogens worldwide. A review of the literature reveals that many climatic variables, functioning singly or in combination, exert varying effects on the distribution and range of Culicoides vector midges and mosquitoes. For example, higher temperatures may be associated with increased insect abundance - thereby amplifying the risk of disease transmission - but there are no indications yet of dramatic shifts occurring in the geographic range of Culicoides midges. However, the same cannot be said for mosquitoes: over the last few decades, multiple Asian species have established themselves in Europe, spread and are unlikely to ever be eradicated. Research on how insects respond to changes in climate is still in its infancy. The authors argue that we need to grasp how other annectant changes, such as extremes in precipitation (drought and flooding), may affect the dispersal capability of mosquitoes. Models are useful for assessing the interplay between mosquito vectors expanding their range and the native flora and fauna; however, ecological studies employing classical mark-release-recapture techniques remain essential for addressing fundamental questions about the survival and dispersal of mosquito species, with the resulting parameters fed directly into new-generation disease transmission models.

Many of these diseases are no longer present, mainly because of changes in land use, agricultural methods, residential patterns, human behaviour, and vector control. However, diseases that may be transmitted to humans from wild birds or mammals (zoonoses; e.g. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and leptospirosis) continue to circulate in nature in many parts of the country. Most vector-borne diseases exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, which clearly suggests that they are weather sensitive. Rainfall, temperature, and other weather variables affect in many ways both the vectors and the pathogens they transmit. For example, high temperatures can increase or reduce survival rate, depending on the vector, its behaviour, ecology, and many other factors. Thus, the probability of transmission may or may not be increased by higher temperatures. The tremendous growth in international travel increases the risk of importation of vector-borne diseases, some of which can be transmitted locally under suitable circumstances at the right time of the year.

Nonindigenous species and climate change are critical ecosystem stressors that need greater attention in the context of spatial planning and management of protected areas. Risk of invasion into protected areas needs to be quantified under current and projected climate conditions in conjunction with prioritization of key vectors and vulnerable areas to enable development of effective management strategies. 2. We assessed the likelihood of invasion across networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) to determine how invaded MPAs may compromise MPA networks by sharing nonindigenous species. We evaluated invasion risk in 83 MPAs along Canada's Pacific coast for eight nonindigenous species based on environmental suitability under current and future (average conditions from 2041 to 2070) climate conditions and association with shipping and boating pathways. We applied species distribution models and network analysis of vessel tracking data for 805 vessels in 2016 that connected MPAs. 3. The probability of occurrence within MPAs and the proportion of MPA area that is suitable to the modelled species significantly increased under future climate conditions, with six species reaching over 90% predicted occurrence across MPAs and over 70% of suitable area within MPAs. Vessel traffic created four network clusters of 61 highly connected MPAs that spanned the coastline. Occupancy of over 90% of the MPAs within the clusters was predicted for most species. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate a high likelihood of marine protected area (MPA) network invasion based on current and future environmental conditions and vectors of spread, and the potential for extensive nonindigenous species distributions within MPAs. Our approach highlights how interacting stressors can exacerbate MPA susceptibility to nonindigenous species, adding further challenges for protected area management. Management planning that invests in understanding connectivity and vector processes (human behaviours) is more likely to derive effective policies to stem the flow of nonindigenous species under both current and future conditions.

Ongoing demand for critical ecosystem services requires an understanding of the populations and communities in these ecosystems in the future. This paper represents a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation-funded Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network addressing the core research area of """"populations and communities."""" The objective of this effort was to show the importance of long-term data collection and experiments for addressing the hardest questions in scientific ecology that have significant implications for environmental policy and management. Each LTER site developed at least one compelling case study about what their site could look like in 50-100 yr as human and environmental drivers influencing specific ecosystems change. As the case studies were prepared, five themes emerged, and the studies were grouped into papers in this LTER Futures Special Feature addressing state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects. This paper addresses the """"connectivity"""" theme and has examples from the Phoenix (urban), Niwot Ridge (alpine tundra), McMurdo Dry Valleys (polar desert), Plum Island (coastal), Santa Barbara Coastal (coastal), and Jornada (arid grassland and shrubland) sites. Connectivity has multiple dimensions, ranging from multi-scalar interactions in space to complex interactions over time that govern the transport of materials and the distribution and movement of organisms. The case studies presented here range widely, showing how land-use legacies interact with climate to alter the structure and function of arid ecosystems and flows of resources and organisms in Antarctic polar desert, alpine, urban, and coastal marine ecosystems. Long-term ecological research demonstrates that connectivity can, in some circumstances, sustain valuable ecosystem functions, such as the persistence of foundation species and their associated biodiversity or, it can be an agent of state change, as when it increases wind and water erosion. Increased connectivity due to warming can also lead to species range expansions or contractions and the introduction of undesirable species. Continued long-term studies are essential for addressing the complexities of connectivity. The diversity of ecosystems within the LTER network is a strong platform for these studies.",2021,"","Special Feature: Forecasting Earth's ecosystems with long-term ecological research.","12","5","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3432","","#19475","Iwaniec 2021","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-08-27 07:04:03)(Select): plum island case study: species expanding range from US into Canada; reasonable transboundary assumption ;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

To date, documented autochthonous cases of Chagas in humans in the United States are rare. Kissing bugs are capable of adapting to new habitats such as human domiciles; however, they do not colonize homes in the United States as in Central and South America.

J.","Climate change can have a complex impact that also influences human and animal health. For example, climate change alters the conditions for pathogens and vectors of zoonotic diseases. Signs of this are the increasing spread of the West Nile and Usutu viruses and the establishment of new vector species, such as specific mosquito and tick species, in Europe and other parts of the world. With these changes come new challenges for maintaining human and animal health. This paper reports on an analysis of the literature focused on a bibliometric analysis of the Scopus database and VOSviewer software for creating visualization maps which identifies the zoonotic health risks for humans and animals caused by climate change. The sources retained for the analysis totaled 428 and different thresholds (N) were established for each item varying from N 5 to 10. The main findings are as follows: First, published documents increased in 2009-2015 peaking in 2020. Second, the primary sources have changed since 2018, partly attributable to the increase in human health concerns due to human-to-human transmission. Third, the USA, the UK, Canada, Australia, Italy, and Germany perform most zoonosis research. For instance, sixty documents and only 17 countries analyzed for co-authorship analysis met the threshold led by the USA; the top four author keywords were """"climate change"""", """"zoonosis"""", """"epidemiology"""", and """"one health;"""" the USA, the UK, Germany, and Spain led the link strength (inter-collaboration); the author keywords showed that 37 out of the 1023 keywords met the threshold, and the authors' keyword's largest node of the bibliometric map contains the following: infectious diseases, emerging diseases, disease ecology, one health, surveillance, transmission, and wildlife.

A.","Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) cause many diseases worldwide and their transmission is likely to change with land use and climate changes. La Crosse virus (LACV) is historically transmitted by the native mosquito Aedes triseriatus (Say) in the upper Midwestern US, but the invasive congeners Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and A. japonicus (Theobald), which co-occur with A. triseriatus in water-holding containers, may be important accessory vectors in the Appalachian region where La Crosse encephalitis is an emerging disease. This review focuses on evidence for how climate, land use, and biological invasions may have direct abiotic and indirect community-level impacts on immature developmental stages (eggs and larvae) of Aedes mosquitoes. Because vector-borne diseases usually vary in space and time and are related to the ecology of the vector species, we propose that the ecology of its mosquito vectors, particularly at their immature stages, has played an important role in the emergence of La Crosse encephalitis in the Appalachian region and represents a model for investigating the effects of environmental changes on other vector-borne diseases. We summarize the health effects of LACV and associated socioeconomic costs that make it the most important native mosquito-borne disease in the US. We review of the transmission of LACV, and present evidence for the impacts of climate, land use, and biological invasions on Aedes mosquito communities. Finally, we discuss important questions about the ecology of LACV mosquito vectors that may improve our understanding of the impacts of environmental changes on LACV and other arboviruses.",2012,"","EcoHealth","9","2","217-228","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-012-0773-7","","#20312","Leisnham 2012","Colleen Miller (2024-08-22 02:35:09)(Select): Implicit transboundary ;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

J.","Control programs are implemented to mitigate the damage caused by invasive species worldwide. In the highly invaded Great Lakes, the climate is expected to become warmer with more extreme weather and variable precipitation, resulting in shorter iced-over periods and variable tributary flows as well as changes to pH and river hydrology and hydrogeomorphology. We review how climate change influences physiology, behavior, and demography of a damaging invasive species, sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), in the Great Lakes, and the consequences for sea lamprey control efforts. Sea lamprey control relies on surveys to monitor abundance of larval sea lamprey in Great Lakes tributaries. The abundance of parasitic, juvenile sea lampreys in the lakes is calculated by surveying wounding rates on lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and trap surveys are used to enumerate adult spawning runs. Chemical control using lampricides (i.e., lamprey pesticides) to target larval sea lamprey and barriers to prevent adult lamprey from reaching spawning grounds are the most important tools used for sea lamprey population control. We describe how climate change could affect larval survival in rivers, growth and maturation in lakes, phenology and the spawning migration as adults return to rivers, and the overall abundance and distribution of sea lamprey in the Great Lakes. Our review suggests that Great Lakes sea lamprey may benefit from climate change with longer growing seasons, more rapid growth, and greater access to spawning habitat, but uncertainties remain about the future availability and suitability of larval habitats. Consideration of the biology of invasive species and adaptation of the timing, intensity, and frequency of control efforts is critical to the management of biological invasions in a changing world, such as sea lamprey in the Great Lakes.",2020,"","Global Change Biology","26","3","1118-1137","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14957","","#20320","Lennox 2020","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

However, we know little of its ecology in the Arctic, which is unfortunate, because it possesses many traits that make it an excellent biomonitor of the condition of Arctic marine environments. Presently, Arctic fulmars face threats from harvest, bycatch in fisheries, and fouling in oil spills while the birds are in their winter range (the North Atlantic). However, during breeding, migration, and overwintering, they may also experience stress from ecotourism, contaminants, particulate garbage, and climate change. In this paper I review the effects of all of these threats on fulmars and I describe how the ecology of these birds makes them particularly suitable for tracking contaminants, garbage, and the effects of climate change in the Arctic marine ecosystem.

The Arctic and Antarctic regions are extremely sensitive to climate change and have displayed profound and variable changes over recent decades, including decreases in sea ice extent, greening of tundra, and changes to hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. It is unclear how polar-adapted arthropods will respond to such changes, though many are expected to be at great risk of extinction. Here, we review the adaptive mechanisms that allow polar arthropods to persist in extreme environments and discuss how the effects of climate change at the poles will likely favour non-native species or those with the ability to rapidly evolve and/or acclimate. We find that physiological, behavioural, plastic, and genetic data are limited in scope for polar arthropods and research on adaptive responses to change is scarce. This restricts our ability to predict how they may respond to a warming climate. We call for a greater investment in research that specifically targets the ecology and evolution of these taxa, including genomic and transcriptomic approaches that can evaluate the potential for plastic and evolved environmental responses.",2022,"","Diversity","15","1","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d15010047","","#20888","Matheson 2022","Laura  Dee (2024-08-21 08:40:37)(Select): Arctic ;","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

While changes in fish populations and community structure threaten the sustainability of fisheries, our capacity to adapt by tracking and projecting marine species remains a challenge due to data discontinuities in biological observations, lack of data availability, and mismatch between data and real species distributions. To assess the extent of this challenge, we review the global status and accessibility of ongoing scientific bottom trawl surveys. In total, we gathered metadata for 283,925 samples from 95 surveys conducted regularly from 2001 to 2019. We identified that 59% of the metadata collected are not publicly available, highlighting that the availability of data is the most important challenge to assess species redistributions under global climate change. Given that the primary purpose of surveys is to provide independent data to inform stock assessment of commercially important populations, we further highlight that single surveys do not cover the full range of the main commercial demersal fish species. An average of 18 surveys is needed to cover at least 50% of species ranges, demonstrating the importance of combining multiple surveys to evaluate species range shifts. We assess the potential for combining surveys to track transboundary species redistributions and show that differences in sampling schemes and inconsistency in sampling can be overcome with spatio-temporal modeling to follow species density redistributions. In light of our global assessment, we establish a framework for improving the management and conservation of transboundary and migrating marine demersal species.

C.","Introduction: Inuit from communities across the Arctic are still existing in subsistence living. Hunting, fishing and gathering is an important part of the culture and the harvested 'country food' provides sources of nutrients invaluable to maintaining the health of the populations. However, Inuit are voicing their concerns on how observed climate change is impacting on their traditional life. The objective of this study was to report on observed climate changes and how they affect the country food harvest in two communities in the Canadian Arctic. The nutritional implications of these changes are discussed and also how the communities need to plan for adaptations. Methods: A total of 17 adult participants from Repulse Bay and Kugaaruk, Nunavut were invited to participate. Participants were selected using purposeful sampling methods selecting the most knowledgeable community members for the study. Inuit Elders, hunters, processors of the animals, and other community members above the age of 18 years were selected for their knowledge of harvesting and the environment. Two-day bilingual focus groups using semi-directed, unstructured questions were held in each community to discuss perceived climate changes related to the access and availability of key species. Key topics of focus included ice, snow, weather, marine mammals, land mammals, fish, species ranges, migration patterns, and quality and quantity of animal populations. Maps were used to pinpoint harvesting locations. A qualitative analysis categorizing strategy was used for analysis of data. This strategy involves coding data in order to form themes and to allow for cross-comparison analysis between communities. Each major animal represented a category; other categories included land, sea, and weather. Results were verified by the participants and community leaders. Results: Three themes emerged from the observations: (1) ice/snow/water; (2) weather; and (3) changes in species. Climate change can affect the accessibility and availability of the key species of country foods including caribou, marine mammals, fish, birds and plants. Various observations on relationship between weather and population health and distributions of the animal/plant species were reported. While many of the observations were common between the two communities, many were community specific and inconsistent. Participants from both communities found that climate change was affecting the country food harvest in both positive and negative ways. Key nutrients that could be affected are protein, iron, zinc, n-3 fatty acids, selenium and vitamins D and A. Conclusion: Community members from Repulse Bay and Kugaaruk have confirmed that climate change is affecting their traditional food system.

U.","Of the 3,500 species of mosquitoes worldwide, only a small portion carry and transmit the mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) that cause approximately half a million deaths annually worldwide. The most common exotic MBDs, such as malaria and dengue, are not currently established in Canada, in part because of our relatively harsh climate; however, this situation could evolve with climate change. Mosquitoes native to Canada may become infected with new pathogens and move into new regions within Canada. In addition, new mosquito species may move into Canada from other countries, and these exotic species may bring exotic MBDs as well. With high levels of international travel, including to locations with exotic MBDs, there will be more travel-acquired cases of MBDs. With climate change, there is the potential for exotic mosquito populations to become established in Canada. There is already a small area of Canada where exotic Aedes mosquitoes have become established although, to date, there is no evidence that these carry any exotic (or already endemic) MBDs. The increased risks of spreading MBDs, or introducing exotic MBDs, will need a careful clinical and public health response. Clinicians will need to maintain a high level of awareness of current trends, to promote mosquito bite prevention strategies, and to know the laboratory tests needed for early detection and when to report laboratory results to public health. Public health efforts will need to focus on ongoing active surveillance, public and professional awareness and mosquito control.

Until recently, this ideology was entrenched in resource management and policy. Traditional ecological knowledge, historical ecology, archaeology, and palaeoecological research have shown these assumptions to be wrong. In this paper we take a multidisciplinary approach (biogeography, paleoecology, dendrochronology, and bioclimatic envelope modeling) to better understand the role of climate and fire in the formation of eco-cultural landscapes. We synthesize results from pollen and charcoal analysis in Garry oak ecosystems that indicate there were continuous and frequent prescribed burning events, with more severe fires occurring every 26-41 years in southwest British Columbia throughout the Anthropocene (~last 250 years) that substantially altered forest structure and composition. These results are consistent with stand age reconstructions in BC and Washington with Garry oak establishment beginning ~1850 AD, corresponding with modern fire exclusion, aboriginal population decline, and end of the Little Ice Age. Douglas-fir recruitment has been continuous since ~1900, with succession of oak woodland to closed conifer forest at most sites. These findings indicate that the structure of many Garry oak ecosystems have been profoundly influenced by eco-cultural practices. Overwhelming evidence indicates that in many cases these ecosystems are dependent on prescribed fire for their open structure.

A key question is how these changes will alter the provision of ecosystem services from the ocean, particularly from fisheries. To answer this question, we need to understand not only the ecological dynamics of marine systems, but also human adaptation and feedbacks between humans and the rest of the natural world. In this review, we outline what we have learned from research primarily in continental shelf ecosystems and fishing communities of North America. Key findings are that marine animals are highly sensitive to warming and are responding quickly to changes in water temperature, and that such changes are often happening faster than similar processes on land. Changes in species distributions and productivity are having substantial impacts on fisheries, including through changing catch compositions and longer distances traveled for fishing trips. Conflicts over access to fisheries have also emerged as species distributions are no longer aligned with regulations or catch allocations. These changes in the coupled natural-human system have reduced the value of ecosystem services from some fisheries and risk doing so even more in the future. Going forward, substantial opportunities for more effective fisheries management and operations, marine conservation, and marine spatial planning are likely possible through greater consideration of climate information over time-scales from years to decades.",2020,"","Special Feature: Marine ecosystem services: Ecological, socioeconomic and cultural sustainability.","63","1","17-26","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1438-390X.12050","","#22124","Pinsky 2020","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This strategy is intended to provide guidance so that the unparalleled collaborative efforts to conserve the iconic greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) by State and Federal agencies, Tribes, academia, nongovernmental organizations, and stakeholders can be expanded to the entire sagebrush biome to benefit the people and wildlife that depend on this ecosystem. This report is organized into 3 parts. """"Part I. Importance of the Sagebrush Biome to People and Wildlife"""" introduces the biome and a subset of the more than 350 species of plants and animals associated with sagebrush for which there is some level of conservation concern. These include several sagebrush obligates that have been petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), including greater sage-grouse, Gunnison sage-grouse (C. minimus; listed as threatened), and pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis). Other sagebrush-dependent species, such as pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), have experienced significant population declines. """"Part II. Change Agents in the Sagebrush Biome-Extent, Impacts, and Effort to Address Them"""" is an overview of the variety of change agents that are causing the continued loss and degradation of sagebrush. Topics covered include altered fire regimes, invasive plant species, conifer expansion, overabundant free-roaming equids, and human land uses, including energy development, cropland conversion, infrastructure, and improper livestock grazing. Climate changes, including warmer temperatures and altered amounts and timing of precipitation, have and will likely increasingly compound negative effects to sagebrush ecosystems from all these threats. """"Part III. Current Conservation Paradigm and Other Conservation Needs for Sagebrush"""" begins with an overview of how sage-grouse conservation, and the associated efforts and collaborations, may be able to address threats to and restoring degraded sagebrush and habitat for other sagebrush-dependent and -associated species. Meeting conservation goals for sage-grouse, mule deer, pygmy rabbits, and other sagebrush-associated wildlife will require extensive restoration of sagebrush communities already converted or degraded by the change agents outlined in Part II of this report. Concepts, considerations, techniques for restoration, and adaptive management and monitoring are discussed to help set the stage for potential strategies to improve conditions throughout the sagebrush biome. Communication, outreach, and engagement can enhance grassroots conservation efforts and build the next generation of managers, practitioners, scientists, and communicators who will care for the sagebrush ecosystem and stimulate or sustain public participation in sagebrush conservation issues.",2021,"","Open-File Report - US Geological Survey","","2020-1125","xxxiv-pp","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20201125","","#22478","Remington 2021","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-26 00:23:13)(Select): Sagebrush exists at the Montana-Canada border, implying transboundary implications.

H.; Bernard, S. M.; Patz, J. A.","Exposure to waterborne and foodborne pathogens (e.g. bacteria, viruses and protozoa) can occur via drinking water (associated with faecal contamination), seafood (due to natural microbial hazards, toxins, or wastewater disposal) or fresh produce (irrigated or processed with contaminated water). Weather influences the transport and dissemination of these microbial agents via rainfall and runoff and the survival and/or growth through such factors as temperature. Federal and state laws and regulatory programmes protect much of the US population from waterborne disease; however, if climate variability increases, current and future deficiencies in areas such as watershed protection, infrastructure, and storm drainage systems will probably increase the risk of contamination events. Knowledge about transport processes and the fate of microbial pollutants associated with rainfall and snowmelt is key to predicting risks from a change in weather variability. Although recent studies identified links between climate variability and occurrence of microbial agents in water, the relationships need further quantification in the context of other stresses. In the marine environment as well, there are few studies that adequately address the potential health effects of climate variability in combination with other stresses such as overfishing, introduced species, and rise in sea level. Advances in monitoring are necessary to enhance early-warning and prevention capabilities. Application of existing technologies, such as molecular fingerprinting to track contaminant sources or satellite remote sensing to detect coastal algal blooms, could be expanded. This assessment recommends incorporating a range of future scenarios of improvement plans for current deficiencies in the public health infrastructure to achieve more realistic risk assessments.",2001,"","Human health consequences of climate variability and change for the United States","109","Supplement 2","211-221","","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3435011","","#22692","Rose 2001","Laura  Dee (2024-08-14 07:10:14)(Select): add full text. implicit transboundary in shared water bodies and disease; Grace Westphal (2024-08-09 05:13:57)(Select): Current link is not full text ;","Biotic; Intervention; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Preliminary findings suggest that this novel coronavirus - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might have originated in bats, and thereafter crossed the species barrier from an intermediate host; eventually spreading within humans. Bat coronaviruses are older than the coronaviruses identified in other animals and have shown a consistent growth rate. The diverse natures of coronaviruses in different bat species have witnessed repeated introductions and occasional establishment in other animal species. The dispersion of animal diseases and zoonotic pathogens is facilitated by rapid globalization, international trading and the ever-growing flow of goods and people. Climate change coupled with globalization and extensive deforestation can act as a significant selection pressure which can lead to onsets of future coronavirus transmission cycles. Climate change alters the availability of viable habitat for the hosts as well which results in the redistribution of host ranges and host densities relative to habitat resources.

Current studies reinforce earlier findings of major climate-change-related impacts on biological systems and document new, more subtle after-effects. For example, many species are shifting their distributions and phenologies at faster rates than were recorded just a few years ago; however, responses are not uniform across species. Shifts have been idiosyncratic and in some cases counterintuitive, promoting new community compositions and altering biotic interactions. Although genetic diversity enhances species' potential to respond to variable conditions, climate change may outpace intrinsic adaptive capacities and increase the relative vulnerabilities of many organisms.

L.","We review the postulated threatening processes that may have affected the decline in the eastern population of the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus L. (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), in North America. Although there are likely multiple contributing factors, such as climate and resource-related effects on breeding, migrating, and overwintering populations, the key landscape-level change appears to be associated with the widespread use of genetically modified herbicide resistant crops that have rapidly come to dominate the extensive core summer breeding range. We dismiss misinterpretations of the apparent lack of population change in summer adult count data as logically flawed. Glyphosate-tolerant soybean and maize have enabled the extensive use of this herbicide, generating widespread losses of milkweed (Asclepias spp.), the only host plants for monarch larvae. Modeling studies that simulate lifetime realized fecundity at a landscape scale, direct counts of milkweeds, and extensive citizen science data across the breeding range suggest that a herbicide-induced, landscape-level reduction in milkweed has precipitated the decline in monarchs.

Native to the Palearctic, the starling has been intentionally introduced to North and South America, South Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, enabling us to explore species traits that may contribute to its invasion success. Coupling the rich studies of life history and more recent explorations of genomic variation among invasions, we illustrate how eco-evolutionary dynamics shape the invasion success of this long-studied and widely distributed species. Especially informative is the comparison between Australian and North American invasions, because these populations colonized novel ranges concurrently and exhibit shared signals of selection despite distinct population histories. In this review, we describe population dynamics across the native and invasive ranges, identify putatively selected traits that may influence the starling's spread, and suggest possible determinants of starling success world-wide.

Species of the genus Quercus present an interesting case because of their economic and ecological importance, and their syngameon biology. As a model for exploring ecological diversification, and with recent advances in forest genomics, knowledge, data, and genomic resources for oak have accumulated and are summarized in this review to foster oaks as potential candidate species for future reforestation programs in Canadian natural, peri-urban, and urban ecosystems. We summarize the state of current genomic research in oak and the accompanying opportunities genomics can provide to achieve the potential of oak silviculture in Canada. Further, we highlight the socio-economic benefits of planting oaks and genomic tools for the development of a traceability system along the value chain. Finally, we discuss some of the remaining challenges to successfully integrate oaks into different forest management programs. In light of their increased drought resistance, oak species exhibit a strong potential as viable choices for future forests, resilient agricultural landscapes, and urban areas. By leveraging the progress made in oak genomics and the new applications that have been developed for commercial species, we can foster the successful management of oak genetic resources for the production of suitable seedlings, thereby aiding Canada in its ambitious pursuit of planting two billion trees to combat climate change.",2024,"","Tree Genetics and Genomes","20","3","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-024-01645-x","","#23896","Tischenko 2024","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"229","The role of climate change in pollinator decline across the Northern Hemisphere is underestimated","Vasiliev, D.; Greenwood, S.","Pollinator biodiversity loss occurs at unprecedented rates globally, with particularly sharp declines documented in the North Temperate Zone. There is currently no consensus on the main drivers of the decline. Although climate change is expected to drive biodiversity loss in the future, current warming is often suggested to have positive impacts on pollinator assemblages in higher latitudes. Consequently, pollinator conservation initiatives in Europe and the USA tend to lack climate adaptation initiatives, an omission of which may be risky if climate change has significant negative impacts on pollinators. To gain an understanding of the impacts of climate change on pollinator biodiversity in the Northern Hemisphere, we conducted a literature review on genetic, species and community level diversity. Our findings suggest that global heating most likely causes homogenization of pollinator assemblages at all levels of pollinator biodiversity, making them less resilient to future stochasticity. Aspects of biodiversity that are rarely measured (e.g. genetic diversity, beta-diversity, species evenness) tend to be most affected, while some dimensions of climate change, such as fluctuations in winter weather conditions, changes in the length of the vegetational season and increased frequency of extreme weather events, that seldom receive attention in empirical studies, tend to be particularly detrimental to pollinators. Negative effects of global heating on pollinator biodiversity are most likely exacerbated by homogenous and fragmented landscapes, widespread across Europe and the US, which limit opportunities for range-shifts and reduce micro-climatic buffering. This suggests the need for conservation initiatives to focus on increasing landscape connectivity and heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales.",2021,"","Science of the Total Environment","775","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145788","","#24082","Vasiliev 2021","Meagan Oldfather (2024-10-04 07:14:26)(Select): Range shifts of pollinators are discussed with examples from North America, but not transboundary range shifts not discussed; How pollinator decline varies across boundaries may also be relevant to shifts in agriculture ; Tyler McIntosh (2024-09-11 05:54:04)(Select): c1: yes

G.; Manning, S. T.; Waugh, J. D.; Ziska, L. H.; Dukes, J. S.","Over the past 50 years, considerable effort has been made by state and national agencies as well as other partners to minimize the establishment and spread of newly introduced and/or emerging invasive plants through single agency-led programmes, inter-agency councils and task forces and, most recently, the landscape approach to early detection and rapid response (EDRR). Examples of single agency-led programmes include the USDA-Carolinas Witchweed Eradication Program in the USA and the Kochia Eradication Project in Western Australia (EDRR 1.0). In recent years, state inter-agency councils and task forces have been formed to address all types of new invasive species - particularly newly introduced species that are not already regulated by federal or state agencies. The Delaware Invasive Species Council, the Ontario Invasive Plant Council and the Beach Vitex Task Force are good examples of this new trend in inter-agency partnering (EDRR 2.0). The landscape approach to EDRR involves the development of EDRR capacity at all levels of the landscape - local to national. It includes individual public and private land units, geographic land units (watersheds, biomes, corridors, etc.) and political land units (towns, counties, states/provinces and nations) (EDRR 3.0). From a societal standpoint, due to global climate change and increased global trade and travel, it is important to emphasize that the impacts of invasive species on food security, human health, and biodiversity will continue to increase unless steps are taken now to minimize their introduction, establishment and spread.

The pest causes considerable costs annually coupled with its strong invasion propensity. Temperature is identified as the dominant abiotic factor affecting herbivorous insects. Several efforts have reported that temperature directly or indirectly influences the geographic distribution, phenology and natural enemies of the poikilothermal FAW, and thus may affect the damage to crops, e.g., the increased developmental rate accelerates the intake of crops at higher temperatures. Under some extreme temperatures, the FAW is likely to regulate various genes expression in response to environmental changes, which causes a wider viability and possibility of invasion threat. Therefore, this paper seeks to review and critically consider the variations of developmental indicators, the relationships between the FAW and its natural enemies and the temperature tolerance throughout its developmental stage at varying levels of heat/cold stress.

(Lindsey E.), 1958-","""""Decades of study on climatic change and its direct and indirect effects on forest ecosystems provide important insights for forest science, management, and policy. A synthesis of recent research from the northeastern United States and eastern Canada shows that the climate of the region has become warmer and wetter over the past 100 years and that there are more extreme precipitation events. Greater change is projected in the future. The amount of projected future change depends on the emissions scenarios used. Tree species composition of northeast forests has shifted slowly in response to climate for thousands of years. However, current human-accelerated climate change is much more rapid and it is unclear how forests will respond to large changes in suitable habitat. Projections indicate significant declines in suitable habitat for spruce-fir forests and expansion of suitable habitat for oak-dominated forests. Productivity gains that might result from extended growing seasons and carbon dioxide and nitrogen fertilization may be offset by productivity losses associated with the disruption of species assemblages and concurrent stresses associated with potential increases in atmospheric deposition of pollutants, forest fragmentation, and nuisance species. Investigations of links to water and nutrient cycling suggest that changes in evapotranspiration, soil respiration, and mineralization rates could result in significant alterations of key ecosystem processes. Climate change affects the distribution and abundance of many wildlife species in the region through changes in habitat, food availability, thermal tolerances, species interactions such as competition, and susceptibility to parasites and disease. Birds are the most studied northeastern taxa. Twenty-seven of the 38 bird species for which we have adequate long-term records have expanded their ranges predominantly in a northward direction. There is some evidence to suggest that novel species, including pests and pathogens, may be more adept at adjusting to changing climatic conditions, enhancing their competitive ability relative to native species. With the accumulating evidence of climate change and its potential effects, forest stewardship efforts would benefit from integrating climate mitigation and adaptation options in conservation and management plans.""""",2012,"01-01","Changing climate, changing forests","","","","","","","#25029","Rustad 2012","Anabel Kinsey (2024-08-09 13:49:01)(Select): HOW IS WILDLIFE IN NORTHEAST FORESTS RESPONDING

"238","Forest ecosystems of temperate climatic regions: from ancient use to climate change","Gilliam, Frank S"," 871I.I. IntroductionForest ecosystems have always been an integral part of human existence, whether as a source of food, fiber, and habitat, as an essential component in maintaining the atmospheric balance of O2 and CO2, or as a source of musical, artistic, or poetic inspiration.Gilliam I chose to begin my book on the ecology of herbaceous communities of forests of eastern North America with this statement for both personal and professional reasons. I suspect that many, if not most, people who have had direct contact with forests eventually grow to establish an intimate connection with them, and at a variety of levels. It was such a personal intimacy that led to my scientific study of them. As this is a Tansley review, it is an appropriate aside to note that Sir Arthur Tansley himself conveyed a special sense of awe regarding forests, more specifically the Kingley Vale in his native England (Fig. ), which offered a view that Tansley considered 'the finest in England,' a place that held both spiritual and professional significance for him, first as an 11-yr-old boy and later as an international leader in the field of plant ecology (Ayres, ).Although humans have long utilized resources associated with all forest biomes - tropical, subtropical, temperate and boreal - I suggest that it is the expanse of human populations in the temperate region that has left the most indelible anthropogenic signature among forested regions. Certainly, deforestation in the tropics has been, and continues to be, a serious environmental concern, for example, with projected loss of forest cover being up to 40% for the Amazon Basin by 2050 (Soares-Fihlo et al., ), and a global annual loss rate of 0.4% (Hansen et al., ; Malhi et al., ). However, a far greater relative fraction of the original extent of temperate forests of the eastern United States has at one time been harvested, with estimates of < 1% of these original forests remaining as primary (old-growth) forests (Davis, ). Older examples of anthropogenic alteration are wide-spread in Central Europe, where forest conversion dates back to the Neolithic Period (EEA, ). Dambrine et al.  found evidence for 2000-yr-old ecological legacies created by temperate forest conversion and subsequent agricultural practices by the Romans in central France. Older still is the human imprint left on temperate forests of China, wherein extensive forest alteration dates back some 6000 yr before present (BP), to such an extent that the roles of climate and anthropogenic disturbance are essentially confounded in understanding long-term patterns of change in vegetation (Liu, ). Thus, if there is a common theme across the global distribution of temperate forests, it is that the human imprint on them is indelibly large and deep, and more so than with any other forest biome type.The term 'global change' is a collective term to describe anthropogenic modification of all aspects of the global environment that has the potential to alter the sustainability of the Earth for life. Often erroneously used interchangeably with anthropogenic climate change (hereafter, simply 'climate change'), global change comprises not only climate change, but also other essential facets of environmental change that interact with climate change, including land use, modification of local and regional hydrological cycles, changes in biogeochemical cycles, and biodiversity loss (Vitousek, ; Steffen et al., ; Franklin et al., ). Clearly, global change is not only quite evident in all temperate forests of the world, but also it has long been so.Indeed, there is an ancient legacy of human alteration of landscapes of temperate forests on a global scale. In North America, notable evidence suggests that, far before the arrival of Europeans, use of fire by Native American peoples greatly impacted the composition of eastern hardwood forests, especially regarding tree species of masting or fruiting value, either directly for food or indirectly for game forage (Kay & Simmons, ). Even the English landscape that was so dear to Tansley (e.g. the Kingley Vale panorama; Fig. ) was anything but pristine wilderness, given widespread deforestation of the English landscape by Romans 2000 yr BP (Williams, ). These observations challenge the very notion of what truly constitutes a primary or pristine state. Further, global change should never be considered a solely recent, modern phenomenon.New terminology has recently been developed to address this awareness. Ellis et al.  quantified anthropogenic change of global biomes (anthromes). Even our current epoch - the Holocene - is increasingly being referred to as the Anthropocene considering wide temporal and spatial scales of human alteration of all facets of the biosphere, from domestication of animal species and conversion of vast areas of land for cultivation, to long-term changes in atmospheric chemistry (Steffen et al., ; Ellis, ; Lewis & Maslin, ).Ellis  conceptualized how humans, more than any other multicellular organism, have transformed Earth's ecosystems, including temperate forests, leading to what he calls anthroecology theory. Figure  provides a visual representation of this theory for a temperate woodland. Beginning with earliest human inhabitation of the Earth, human populations have not only expanded in number, but have also changed socio-culturally, from hunter-gatherer, to horticultural, eventually to our current industrial status. The result has been chronic anthropogenic change in land use and cover, patterns of energy consumption, ecosystem properties (e.g. carbon flux and nutrient cycling) and ecosystem state (from 'wild' to 'novel' to 'used') (Fig. ). This provides a conceptual framework for this review, as it links ancient use of temperate forests to current patterns of climate change.The purpose of this review is to bring into focus the diverse forests of the temperate region of the biosphere, with particular emphasis on crucial challenges for the future of temperate forests. Although these are generally found between 20° and 60° in each of the north and south latitudes, because land mass distribution of the biosphere is decidedly asymmetrical (more land occurring north of the equator) and due to a variety of climatic, oceanographic, and orographic factors, temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere lack the widespread nature of their northern counterparts. Consequently, somewhat more emphasis will be placed on temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere.871II.II. A brief biogeography and history of temperate forestsIn North America, temperate forests span most of the eastern United States as hardwoods of widely varying species dominance, with conifer and mixed (conifer/hardwood) forests occurring in parts of the southeast, west and, especially, the Pacific Northwest, from the coastal United States into Canada. Temperate forests dominate essentially all of England and northern Europe, with a narrow band reaching far into Russia, much of eastern China and virtually all of Japan (Fig. ). Distributions of temperate forests are more restricted in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere, including southern Chile, southeastern Australia and all of Tasmania, and parts of New Zealand, including all of the North Island, where it is referred to as oceanic temperate forest (McGlone et al., ). Temperate conifers tend to dominate in more extreme conditions (e.g. cold climates and/or infertile soils) (Reich & Frelich, ; Waring, ), or in fire-dominated regions (e.g. the southeastern Coastal Plain and western regions of the USA), although conifer dominance in other regions (e.g. North American Pacific Northwest) has been ascribed to unusually long photosynthetic seasons arising from mild winters with abundant rainfall (Givnish, ) (Fig. ).The predominant climate of most of these forest regions is one of distinct cyclic, seasonal changes involving periods of growth and dormancy. Specific temporal patterns of seasonal change, however, display impressive variability among temperate forest regions, a function of latitude (longer growing seasons toward at lower latitudes), topographic features (e.g. mountains) and proximity to oceans with marine currents of varying prevailing temperatures. The latter is evidenced by the development of temperate rainforests associated with coastal main lands or islands, including the Pacific coast of North America and small areas of Great Britain and Japan, and throughout most of southern Chile, southeastern Australia and southern New Zealand (Alaback, ).Geological history and soil formation also vary greatly among temperate forests, thus precluding broad generalizations (Bally & Palmer, ; Ponge et al., ). In North America the geological (continental) structure is generally symmetrical, beginning with the middle outward including shield, interior lowlands, mountains, coastal plains, continental shelves and ocean basins. By contrast, Eurasia lacks such symmetry, with Europe being geologically separated from Asia by the Ural Mountains (King, ). Thus, the broad spatial patterns of soil formation in North America contrast sharply with those for Asia (Bally & Palmer, ; Ponge et al., ; King, ).One aspect of geological history shared among temperate forests is the profound effects of glaciation (Clark et al., ). Most relevant is the occurrence of the last glacial maximum (LGM), a period of widespread surface ice that ended c. 20 000 yr bp (Yokoyama et al., ). Given the extent of LGM glaciers (Fig. a,b), any exposition of temperate forests necessitates at least a perfunctory understanding of their widespread nature. Glaciations of the LGM even have a diverse nomenclature, based on global location (Ehlers & Gibbard, ). Prominent in the Northern Hemisphere were the Wisconsin glaciation in North America and the Devensian,Wurm and Weichselian glaciations in the British Isles, Alps and Northern/Central Europe, respectively. In the Southern Hemisphere, LGM glaciers include the Llanquihue and Otira glaciations in Chile and New Zealand, respectively.Despite their widespread occurrence, temperate forests of many regions are similar in development toward their present state. Most of the Northern Hemisphere was once dominated by the Arcto-Tertiary geoflora (Cain, ; Axelrod, ; Whittaker, ). This was a time (c. 15 Myr BP) of a far warmer global climate than the present one, which was especially pronounced toward polar areas. Within this expansive forest were numerous gymnosperm genera, such as Cedrus,Picea,Pinus and Tsuga, and angiosperm genera - Acer,Betula,Carya,Corylus,Castanea,Fagus,Magnolia,Quercus,Tilia,Ulmus and Liquidambar (Xiang et al., ; Graham, ). Increased warming during the Tertiary yielded to the cooler Quaternary, leading to the massive glaciers of the LGM over much of what is now boreal forest throughout the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. a). This pushed many species south toward the unglaciated refugia (e.g. Appalachian Mountains), which may have provided sources of remigration of species toward their current distributions (Davis, ; Graham, ; Stebich et al., ).Interestingly, the LGM is essentially irrelevant for temperate forests of China, largely unaffected by Quaternary glaciation (Liu, ). Pollen records reveal a diverse assemblage of tree genera at this time, varying from mixed conifer-hardwood to deciduous to widespread subtropical broadleaved evergreen forests; hardwoods comprised genera similar to other temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere, with a diverse oak (Quercus) flora (Liu, ). Stratigraphy of mid-Holocene pollen demonstrates a period of maximum warmth (i.e. the Hypsithermal). Throughout northern regions at this time, forests increased in diversity with thermophilous hardwoods expanding, replacing both pine and, toward the south, birch (Liu, ).Although glaciation also occurred in the Southern Hemisphere, other processes were equally significant in determining its temperate forest tree flora, including higher sea-to-land ratios creating conditions leading to temperate rain forests on west-facing coasts (Alaback, ) and species of Nothofagus and conifers of the families Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae (Beard, ; Kershaw & Wagstaff, ). During the Tertiary Period, drying occurred in continental regions, selecting more xeromorphic and even pyrophilic, fire-tolerant genera, such as Eucalyptus (Beard, ).Fire - typically more prevalent among conifer-dominated stands than hardwood-dominated stands - has long been an integral factor in directing the development of temperate forest ecosystems. Marlon et al.  used the paleorecord to examine the relationship between abrupt changes in global climate and enhanced frequency of fire. Using data from 35 charcoal/pollen records in North America to assess change in fire regimes during the past 15-10 kyr (the latest glacial-interglacial transition, and a time of profound climate change), they found clear links between fire frequency and degree of climate change. Implicit in their evidence is the intimate connection between occurrence of fire and the development of drought conditions in forested regions.874III.III. Climate, soils, composition and land use1. North AmericaTemperate forests of North America occur in the eastern United States primarily as hardwood forests (except for extreme high elevations and southeastern Coastal Plain pinelands) and as conifer and mixed forests in parts of the western United States and Canada. Using the Köppen-Geiger climate classification (Kottek et al., ), the predominant eastern climate would be classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) to the south, and humid continental (Dfa) to the north; prevailing climates for western forests are predominantly warm temperate (Csb), with boreal zone-like conditions (Dfc) at high elevations of central western USA. Winter climate is dominated by fluctuations between cold, dry arctic air, along with cyclonic storms with marine-derived moisture to produce occasional heavy snows. Winter temperatures vary from means of -5°C in the north to 10°C toward the south. Spring brings thunderstorm activity through mixing of cold polar air with moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. Mean summer temperatures throughout the region range from 20° to 27°C. Frost-free periods are generally between 120 and 150 d in the north to > 250 d in the south. Mean annual precipitation is 80-140 cm (Archibold, ). The prevailing climate of the Pacific Northwest forests is largely maritime, varying with latitude and elevation, with precipitation increasing with elevation (Franklin & Halpern, ).Soils of eastern forests are generally Alfisols, Inceptisols and Ultisols, glaciated towards the north (Fig. a). Unglaciated soils are old, with soil pH decreasing with age. Soils of western forests are spatially variable. Montane conifer forest soils are usually young, derived from granites, gneisses and schists (Peet, ). Pacific Northwest conifer forest soils comprise Ultisols, Inceptisols and Spodosols, with many soils of volcanic origin (Franklin & Halpern, ).With the exception of the virtual elimination of the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) by the chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) beginning in 1904, current eastern temperate forest types are largely similar to those originally described by Braun . With the highest tree diversity occurring in the mixed mesophytic forest region of the Appalachians, dominant genera include oaks (Quercus spp.), maples (Acer spp.), hickories (Carya spp.) and birch (Betula spp.), along with American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera).Conifer forests vary greatly within the broad temperate region of North America. At the higher elevations throughout the Appalachian mountain range (800-1200 m above sea level (asl) in New England to 1600 m asl in the Great Smoky Mountains), spruce (Abies spp.) and fir (Picea spp.) forests are common (Vankat, ). Southeastern Coastal Plain conifer forests are predominantly pines (Pinus spp.) of a primarily successional nature, the result of frequent natural (e.g. fire) and anthropogenic (e.g. harvesting) disturbances (Platt et al., ); these typically change through secondary succession to Quercus-Carya forests (Peet et al., ). Before European settlement c. 250 yr bp, this region was dominated by a single species - Pinus palustris - which is currently < 3% of its original distribution (Gilliam & Platt, ).Montane conifer forests of western North America contain more genera than those of the eastern United States. Important genera include fir (Abies spp.), juniper (Juniperus spp.), spruce (Picea spp.), pine (Pinus spp.), hemlock (Tsuga spp.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Some of these form mixed forests, especially those associated with elevation gradients and successional status following disturbances, such as fire; hardwoods include maple (Acer spp.), alder (Alnus spp.), poplar (Populus spp.) and mountain ash (Sorbus spp.) (Peet, ). The mild, moist climate of Pacific Northwest (coastal forests west of the Cascade crest) selects for a complex assortment of conifer species, including Pseudotsuga menziesii,Tsuga spp., Abies spp., Pinus spp. and several genera of cedars (family Cupressaceae, e.g. Calocedrus,Chamaecyparis,Thuja), including the awe-inspiring redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), the tallest tree in the world (Franklin & Halpern, ).2. EuropeThe European Environment Agency divides Europe into 11 biogeographical regions, based on prevailing climate and proximity to bodies of water (EEA, ). Regions most germane to this discussion are the Atlantic, Black Sea, Continental and Pannonian, with Continental occupying by far the largest area (Finnie et al., ). Temperate forests here are predominantly hardwood species, with conifer forests increasing in importance toward the north and with increasing elevation. These extend farther east into western Russia, wherein climate becomes increasingly continental and drier, contrasting with the maritime climate toward the west. The climate throughout this area ranges from temperate oceanic (Do) in the west to temperate continental (Dc) eastward (Kottek et al., ). Winter temperatures vary from maritime means of 3° to 5°C to continental means of -4° to -15°C in central Russia. Mean summer temperatures generally range from 22° to 30°C. Mean annual precipitation is 50-75 cm, with snow uncommon in lowland parts of Europe (Archibold, ).Many of the soils of Europe often are referred to collectively as brown earths, which are similar to North American Alfisols, except that many are developed from calcareous parent materials wherein they are more similar to Inceptisols. Other common soils are Spodosols, especially in northern latitudes (Jones et al., ).Human alteration of temperate forests over recent millennia is perhaps most pronounced here (Mitchell & Cole, ; Niklasson et al., ), where only c. 25% of forests are considered primary (sensu FAO, : 'forest of native species where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes have not been significantly disturbed'), something that disconnects forest distribution with climate (Allen et al., ). Evidence suggests that anthropogenic disturbance began there in the Neolithic, with widespread forest conversion beginning c. 7000 yr BP (EEA, ). Since these ancient times, forest condition has been closely linked with human populations and socio-economic development. Both historical and paleo-ecological records indicate periods not only of increased logging, but also of land abandonment and forest regrowth, including the plague years of the 1300s (EEA, ).There are generally fewer tree species in Europe than in North America, a contrast further exacerbated by extensive planting of conifer species throughout hardwood ranges (Augusto et al., ). Despite this, the two regions share many deciduous genera, including Quercus,Acer,Betula,Ulmus and Fagus (Pages & Michalet, ; Ellenberg, ). EEA  recognizes a mesophytic deciduous forest type, quite analogous to that which dominates the eastern United States. Analogous to chestnut blight in eastern USA, European species of Ulmus, especially white elm (U. laevis), have been decimated by the Dutch elm disease (Ophiostoma ulmi), which has also decimated elm species of North America (Peterken, ).The current extent of European temperate conifer forests is greatly modified by past and current policies to plant vast areas of productive conifer species. Again, widespread native deciduous forests have been replaced by conifer plantations, modifying the general composition of the western European temperate forest. Although some of these were transplanted from within Europe (e.g. Norway spruce, Picea abies and Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris), others were imported from North America (e.g. Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis and Douglas fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii) (Augusto et al., ). Not surprisingly, then, as with hardwood genera, predominant European conifer genera overlap greatly with those of North America, including Abies,Picea and Pinus (EEA, ).3. AsiaSimilar to their North American counterparts, temperate forests of Asia occur primarily as hardwood forests throughout the eastern part of the continent, extending to and including virtually the entire island of Japan, except for extremes of elevation and north latitude, where there are well-developed boreal conifer forests (Aiba, ), resulting from similar climates between the two regions, primarily humid subtropical and temperate continental, Cf and Dc, respectively (Kottek et al., ). The most profound difference in climate between these regions is the existence of a monsoon season widespread in parts of Asia, arising from drastic pressure changes over the continent, that is, Monsoon Asia (Nakashizuka & Iida, ). Consequently, precipitation in Monsoon Asia has a pronounced summer maximum, with up to 90% falling between May and September. The wettest areas are on the Korean peninsula. Mean winter temperatures range from c. 3°C to -15°C in southern coastal and northern interior regions, respectively. Spring is dominated by moist tropical maritime air, with July temperatures averaging from 22°C to 28°C (Archibold, ).Soils of Asian temperate forests are analogous to those of North American temperate forests. These vary from Alfisols in upland regions to Ultisols toward the south and east, with Entisols forming from alluvium along rivers. Spodosols develop in conifer-dominated regions associated with higher elevation and more northern latitudes (Archibold, ).Although the temperate deciduous forests of Asia are the most species-rich temperate forests in the world, many of them have been altered irreparably by land use, particularly in the lowland plains, which are virtually entirely cultivated (An et al., ). Many Asian tree taxa are quite common in North America (Ying, ; Nakashizuka & Iida, ; Fang et al., ), including Quercus,Ulmus,Tilia,Fraxinus,Acer and Lindera (Henbo et al., ; Takahashi, ), and close relatives such as Asian Castanopsis and Distylium (Miura et al., ). Species vary greatly with elevation (Sang & Bai, ), with upland areas supporting species of Betula,Populus,Acer and Tilia;Salix,Betula and Populus are common in riparian areas (An et al., ). Forest type varies greatly with latitude; from north to south, this grades from mixed conifer to deciduous to mixed deciduous, then to widely distributed subtropical broadleaved evergreen forests (Liu, ).Asian conifers increase in importance with increasing elevation. Working in Chinese subalpine forests, Taylor et al.  reported extensive stands as mosaics of conifer (Abies,Larix,Sabina and Tsuga) and hardwood (Betula) patches. Other conifer genera include Picea and Pinus (Miyajima & Takahashi, ).4. Southern HemisphereBecause the distribution of land mass of the biosphere is decidedly asymmetrical, with far more land area being distributed north of the equator, temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere lack the expansiveness so characteristic of the Northern Hemisphere. These forests are confined to relatively narrow bands along western South America, southeastern Australia (including all of Tasmania) and northern New Zealand, including the northwestern half of South Island. Climatic, oceanographic and orographic factors further limit forest development in many areas of the Southern Hemisphere. These regions display very high ocean:land mass ratios; consequently, they are generally of maritime temperate climates (Cf). The Andes range exerts a profound influence on the prevailing climate of temperate-forest South America, with the windward side receiving a relatively constant flow of maritime air from the Pacific Ocean (Perakis & Hedin, ), and many are temperate rain forests (Beard, ). Mean annual temperatures are generally 6-10°C, with a range typically < 10°C. In coastal areas, July-to-January temperatures vary only by 4° or 5°C, with a similar pattern found for coastal southwestern New Zealand. Indeed, summers average c. 20°C, with winters ranging from 10-15°C. Precipitation for most of these sites is very high, exceeding 300 cm, reaching as much as 850 cm (Sturman & Tapper, ).Many of the soils throughout the temperate Southern Hemisphere are highly weathered Spodosols, the result of high amounts of rainfall and its associated fluctuating water table. These soils are generally highly acidic and infertile (Veblen et al., ; Grubb et al., ).Forest genera, and even plant families, of the temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere are quite dissimilar to those of the Northern Hemisphere. Prominent genera are Nothofagus (Nothofagaceae) and Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae), neither part of the native flora in the Northern Hemisphere. Conifer genera are in Araucariaceae (e.g. Araucaria) and Podocarpaceae (e.g. Podocarpus,Dacrydium) (Beard, ; Kershaw & Wagstaff, ). Forests of Chile and Argentina vary sensitively along the Andes-induced climatic gradient. Nothofagus species are dominant throughout these forests (Veblen et al., ; Armesto et al., ), but with Araucaria araucana replacing Nothofagus species under more stressful environmental conditions (Sanguinetti & Kitzberger, ). Mainland forests of Australia are dominated by Eucalyptus and Acacia species, especially in drier areas, whereas Nothofagus species, along with gymnosperms, are found in the cool, moist forests of Tasmania. Nothofagus is common in New Zealand, covering 84% and 40% of the South and North Islands, respectively (Beard, ). The current status of many forests of the Southern Hemisphere represents considerably altered states of the primary conditions, for example, the rainforests of Chile before the Conquest of Chile in the mid-16th Century by Spain (Smith-Ramírez, ).875IV.IV. Climate changeHumans have, indeed, long utilized temperate forests for a variety of purposes (Fig. ). Currently, temperate forests are managed worldwide for timber production, driven by an ever-increasing demand and resulting from relatively rapid growth among overstory dominant species, but also from the versatility of temperate tree species for numerous uses (e.g. paper, construction materials, furniture). Management practices potentially affect these forests across all spatial scales, from the landscape (Rhemtulla et al., ), to the overstory (Beaudet et al., ), and, often most sensitive, the herb layer (Moola & Vasseur, ; von Oheimb & Härdtle, ; Gilliam, ; Hedwall & Brunet, ). Furthermore, management practices historically often have been carried out using methods that are unsustainable in terms of maintaining forest ecosystem structure and function, including plantation forestry, especially conversion from slower-growing hardwood forests to faster-growing conifer plantations (Seidl et al., ), and forest fragmentation (Smith-Ramírez, ). Naudts et al.  suggested that broadscale conversion of temperate European hardwoods to conifer plantations contributes measurably to what is perhaps the most profound modern human influence on these forests - climate change (Lindner et al., ; Parks & Bernier, ).Thus, I suggest the following as the 'bookends' of anthropogenic impacts on temperate forests. The first is their historic - even ancient - and chronic use/conversion by ever-increasing human populations; the second is climate change. The spatial and temporal dimensions of these are superimposed (Fig. ). The legacy effects of the recent and distant past are currently on a trajectory of future dynamics operating under the overriding influence of climate change (Dale et al., ), and all that is associated with it, including altered phenology of organisms (Parmesan & Yohe, ) and extremes of weather-related phenomena (Min et al., ) (Fig. ). All responses of temperate forests to current land-use pressures must be viewed forever through the lens of climate change (Fig. ).In this final section, I emphasize challenges for future sustainability of global temperate forests. This is not meant to represent an exhaustive list of all critical issues. Rather, I emphasize those for which sufficient work has been done to provide an understanding of the nature of the problem. These include the effects of atmospheric deposition of excess N, global change-mediated alterations in phenology of temperate forest species and increases in drought/fire.1. Excess nitrogenMore pronounced in the Northern than the Southern Hemisphere, a major human perturbation of temperate forests worldwide has arisen from emissions of reactive nitrogen (Nr) into the atmosphere leading to chronically elevated deposition of Nr and a cascade of environmental stresses for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and human health (Galloway et al., ). The N comprising 78% of the atmosphere - N2 - is considered nonreactive N because it enters into essentially no photochemical transformations in the atmosphere and no metabolic pathways in organisms, other than N fixation by a small group of symbiotic and nonsymbiotic prokaryotes. However, numerous forms of Nr exist, including NH3, NH4+, NO, NO2, NO3-, 2N2O5, HNO3 and several forms of peroxyacetyl nitrates (Horii et al., ), all capable of undergoing photochemical transformations in the atmosphere and entering terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.Although more research on the effects of excess N has focused on herb-dominated than on forested ecosystems (Clark et al., ; Simkin et al., ), increasingly work is being devoted to understanding such effects on forest ecosystems, including those of the temperate regions (Sutton et al., ). Whereas current increases in N deposition are occurring on a global scale (Bobbink et al., ), N-mediated threats to biodiversity are particularly pronounced for temperate forests, especially given the spatial coincidence of high human population density - and associated N pollution - with temperate forests (Holland & Lamarque, ), the disproportionate contribution of the herbaceous layer to temperate forest diversity (Gilliam, ), and the sensitivity of the forest herb community to excess N (Gilliam, ). More vexing still is that chronically elevated N deposition is occurring contemporaneously and, indeed, interactively with climate change (Maes et al., ).Essentially all initial work on effects of excess N deposition on terrestrial ecosystems examined biogeochemical responses. These studies focused on changes in stream chemistry, generally showing increases in NO3- (from enhanced nitrification and leaching) and base cations (Ca++, Mg++ and K+) coupled with the movement of NO3- (Aber, ). Many areas of temperate forests of North America, especially those of the eastern United States, were shown to be sensitive to N saturation, a phenomenon which develops as atmospheric and microbial supply of available N exceeds biotic demand. Recent work has emphasized the effects of excess N on biodiversity of temperate forests (Thomas et al., ; Clark et al., ; Simkin et al., ). Despite considerable inter-site variability, a broad consensus is that excess N decreases forest biodiversity in temperate forests of North America.Gilliam  provided a conceptual model to describe interactive processes that are sensitive to increased N loading in ways that can lead to loss of herb layer diversity, including altering interspecific competition, increasing herbivory and pathogenic fungal infection, inhibiting mycorrhizal associations and enhancing species invasions. Nitrogen-mediated declines in biodiversity are typically seen as loss of species in the herb layer from the increased cover of fewer nitrophilic species at the expense of numerous N-efficient species (Gilliam et al., ). Fewer studies have focused on responses of tree species to N. Thomas et al.  modelled the potential effects of N on temperate forest C sequestration and tree seedling survivorship. Chronically elevated N deposition enhanced C storage, but decreased survivorship in 8 of 11 common temperate tree species. Following N saturation, C sequestration is typically limited by another nutrient (Leuzinger & Hättenschwiler, ), often phosphorus (Gress et al., ).Research focusing on chronically elevated N deposition leading to N saturation began in Europe much earlier than in North America, primarily because N-related threats appeared earlier and were far more widespread there (Gilliam, ). Although a notable amount of European work has been in the boreal region and in herb-dominated ecosystems, most recent work has been carried out in temperate forested regions, with much of that concerned with the response of the typically species-rich herbaceous layer to excess N, largely based on broad regional synthesis studies (De Schrijver et al., ; Verheyen et al., ; Dirnböck et al., ; Ferretti et al., ).Borrowing a phrase from my home state of West Virginia, where coal mining is common, many N-effects studies in Europe use the forest herb layer community as 'the canary in a coal mine' (wherein caged canaries were once placed in a coal mine, whose death served as an early indication of impending peril for coal miners from coal gas). The wide spatial extent of sampling employed by these studies adds considerable validity and credibility to their findings. Verheyen et al.  compiled data from 1205 permanent/semi-permanent sample plots among 23 carefully selected understory resurvey studies. Utilizing a wide gradient in N deposition across deciduous temperate forests in Europe, they assessed the importance of factors influencing forest herb communities, including rate of N deposition, change in density of large herbivores, and change in forest canopy cover and composition. Their results demonstrated the interactive nature of these factors, concluding that N-mediated increases in nitrophilous species can be obscured by changes in the forest overstory. Similarly, Dirnböck et al.  synthesized long-term monitoring data from 1335 permanent samples among 28 forested sites from northern Fennoscandia to southern Italy, noting temporal trends in herb-layer species cover and diversity. They found a pattern of gradual replacement of N-efficient species by nitrophilous species in response to N deposition that was consistent on the European scale. Hedwall & Brunet  attempted to separate effects of global change and altered land-use in both boreal and temperate forests of Sweden by documenting temporal variation in herb layer species over a 20-yr period in both boreal and temperate forests of Sweden, finding that most species changed in overall frequency. Comparing functional traits of both increasing and declining species, they found that current floristic dynamics were caused by combined effects of climate warming, nitrogen deposition and changing land-use (e.g. plantation forestry). Herb species' changes were more pronounced in temperate, rather than boreal, forests.Less is known regarding the effects of excess N on temperate forests of Asia (Liu et al., ) and the Southern Hemisphere. In China, this arises because of the chronically highly dissected extent of temperate forests (Liu, ) and the spatial distribution of highest amounts of N deposition occurring in tropical/sub-tropical regions (Lu et al., ). In addition to elevated rates of N emissions to the atmosphere (Liu et al., ), much of China's problems with excess N is associated with over-use of N fertilizers for summer maize agriculture (Zhang et al., ). Kim et al.  concluded that increases in N availability throughout Korea and Japan was most likely due to deposition of pollutant N from atmospheric sources from both industrial and agricultural regions. Perakis & Hedin  found that, as a result of their location relative to oceans, with prevailing winds coming off those oceans, forests of the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere receive some of the lowest annual rates of N deposition anywhere in the world (Godoy et al., ).2. Altered phenologyGiven that a prominent feature of all temperate forests is their distinct seasonality, phenology - seasonally recurring events of an organism's life cycle, for example, flowering, emergence of invertebrates, movement of migratory animals, and especially their timing and relationship with the physical environment - plays a key role in the structure and function of temperate forest ecosystems. For plants, phenological changes can be triggered by environmental cues, for example, chilling, spring temperature, growing degree days and daylight (Elmendorf et al., ). Because of their lack of thermoregulation, ectothermic animals (e.g. insects) can resemble plants with respect to environmental influences on and control of phenology, particularly temperature. Changes in phenology can affect several processes essential to survival, growth and reproduction of all organisms, especially critical when complex interspecific interactions are involved, such as plant-pollinator dynamics.Many plant species are classified phenologically, based on seasonal patterns of flowering via photoperiod. Long-day plants flower in spring as day length increases, whereas short-day plants flower from late summer into the fall as day length decreases. Actually, it is the length of uninterrupted darkness that controls flowering, such that long-day plants are more accurately short-night plants and vice versa. Despite this importance of photoperiod, thermoperiod - daily and seasonal patterns of change in temperature - also affects virtually all phenologically controlled plant processes. Anecdotally, gardeners rue days of atypically warm temperatures in late winter that allow flower and leaf buds to break dormancy, only to be followed by seasonal temperatures < 0°C that kill new, susceptible tissues.Evidence indicates that climate change has altered growing seasons in the temperate regions worldwide. Based on global meta-analyses of > 1700 wild species, including woody and herbaceous plants, birds, insects, amphibians and fish, Parmesan & Yohe  found widespread changes in phenology and species distributions attributable to climate warming. Despite some species' temporal stability, most exhibited change as predicted by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They found advancing spring events of 2.3 d/decade, and shifting biogeographical ranges toward the poles of 6.1 km per decade (Parmesan & Yohe, ), calling such changes a 'coherent fingerprint' of the overall effect of climate change on natural systems.Ibáñez et al.  observed that climate warming has altered both spring and autumn phenologies of many species, but found considerable interspecific variation and, for a given species, spatial variation in response to climate change. Forecasting future change, they used a long-term (1953-2005) dataset including spring and autumn plant phenological events (flowering/leaf out and leaf coloring/leaf fall, respectively) of tree, shrub and herbaceous species of temperate forests of South Korea and Japan, finding that most species currently exhibit advanced spring phenology and delayed autumn phenology, consistent with expectations, but also that autumn-based changes are more rapid than those associated with spring. The latter observation contrasts with comparable studies in Europe which show that spring events are changing more rapidly than autumn events (Menzel et al., ).For temperate forests, three relevant factors affecting the phenology of dominant tree species are photoperiod, degree of winter chilling and temperature (Körner & Basler, ). There is, however, interspecific variability in which predominant factor(s) control phenology among temperate forest species, with photoperiod increasing in importance with forest succession; that is, it is more important for long-lived, late-successional species than for short-lived, early-successional species. Although this may mitigate warming-induced change in temperate forest composition, Körner & Basler suggested that opportunistic (e.g. exotic invasive) species may benefit from a warming climate and claim a competitive advantage over photoperiod-sensitive species (Körner & Basler, ).Altered phenology is a driver of change not only for plant species, but also for animal species, creating a complex scenario for plant-animal interactions, particularly pollination. Less a problem for climax canopy hardwood species, which are almost exclusively wind-pollinated, this is irrelevant for temperate conifers, but an especially serious threat for forest herbaceous species. Potts et al.  reviewed patterns of global declines in numerous pollinator species, with an understandable focus on insects - especially bees - considering that they are the primary pollinators of both agricultural crops and wild species. Potential drivers of pollinator loss include habitat loss/fragmentation, agrochemicals, pathogens and introductions of novel species. Also included is climate change, and interactions among virtually all drivers. Effects of climate change on insect pollinators are seen on all hierarchical levels of organization, from the individual to population and community levels. Especially troublesome are the temporal and spatial mismatches between plant species and their insect pollinators, arising temporally from changes in phenology of plant and insect species, and spatially from altered distributions (Potts et al., ).Climate change-altered phenology has extended into changing life cycles among insects, an example of which is the mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae), native to western North America, and a generalist pest for the genus Pinus, often erupting epidemically, and killing wide swathes of trees throughout the region (Fig. a). Mitton & Ferrenberg  studied a recent epidemic of MPB that was an order of magnitude larger than ever recorded and extending to higher elevations/latitudes than on record. They demonstrated that, following 20 yr of increasing air temperatures in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the flight season of MPB began > 1 month earlier than historically known and extended twice that duration. More important was their novel finding that the life cycle of some broods of MPB increased from one to two generations per year (Fig. b). They explained that because this species lacks a diapause (suspension in development), its development is controlled solely by temperature. Accordingly, MPB populations currently respond to climate warming via faster development and expanse into previously inhospitable environments (Mitton & Ferrenberg, ). This work, however, was challenged by Bentz & Powell , who agreed that MPB is influenced by climate change, but stated that such studies need to consider thermally dependent traits that have evolved to maintain seasonality.Climate change interactions have been reported for other forest pest insects. DeRose et al.  combined empirical data, based on US Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis data, with three global change models to evaluate and predict the effect of increasing temperature on the distribution of spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis), which attacks spruce forests of North America. They predicted that extent of attack should increase with temperature, but that there should be time lag in response, given the long-lived nature of host spruce trees.This phenomenon is not confined to North America. Netherer & Schopf  reported similar findings from throughout Europe for defoliating insects, bark beetles and especially the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa), a defoliating insect for numerous conifer species. Its altitudinal and latitudinal distributions are controlled primarily by temperature and are already modified by climate change. Because of the prevailing oceanic climate in the Southern Hemisphere (i.e. generally lower temperatures during the growing season), climate change is predicted to promote contrasting effects on insect cycles there, as well (Deutsch et al., ).Related to climate change-mitigated alterations in phenology are similarly altered changes in biogeographical ranges of species. Again, Parmesan & Yohe  concluded that climate change has caused mean pole-ward range shifts of 6.1 km per decade. Using seven global circulation models (GCMs), Hansen et al.  projected future distributions of prominent temperate forest types of North America, including the eastern deciduous forest and western mountain/coastal forests of the United States, focusing on major tree species. These models differ in their type - equilibrium vs transient - and in assumptions of change in temperature and precipitation. Equilibrium models are older and simulate instantaneous increases in CO2, being run until equilibrium climate conditions are reached; the more recent transient models assume increases in glasshouse gases at 1% yr-1 until 2100, allowing climatic adjustment. Although specific predicted outcomes for eastern forest species varied among models (Fig. ), all concurred in predicting profound shifts in dominant species, especially the virtual elimination the maple-beech-birch forest type (one of the more species-rich forest types of the region) and loblolly-shortleaf pine, and expansion of oak-hickory and oak-pine types (Fig. ). Potential ranges for several subalpine coniferous species are predicted to contract in the western United States (data not shown). Among their conclusions is that changes in climate and land use in the future will be of a magnitude to cause even greater changes in biodiversity. Although distributions of some species, communities and biomes are likely to expand, others will contract, creating novel communities (Hansen et al., ).3. Drought/fireIn their now-classic paper, Hansen et al.  provided forecasts of several outcomes of global climate change using the three-dimensional model of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. These included increased atmospheric warming globally, with degree of warming dependent on growth of trace gas emissions. Another prediction, one relevant for the present and future of global temperate forests, was a notable increase in the frequency of extremes of weather events and conditions. Indeed, this prediction is well-supported by current data collected by the Munchener Ruckversicherungs-Gesellschaft, Geo Risks Research, NatCatSERVICE, wherein they examined global annual frequency of catastrophic disturbances 1980-2014 (Fig. ). All types of catastrophic disturbance, save earthquakes, have increased during this period. These are true extremes, indeed, considering that frequencies of both flooding and drought exhibit large increases over the c. 35 yr time period. Relevant to the current discussion is the increased frequency of drought, a disturbance not directly associated with any particular biome, but representing an especially serious threat to temperate forests (Fig. ).Forests typically develop in the temperate zone wherever there is sufficient precipitation to maintain soil moisture amounts capable of supporting tree growth and survival. Thus, the occurrence of extensive drought will have directly damaging effects on tree species. In addition to the direct limitations of drought-induced moisture stress, however, is the drought-induced increase in the frequency of fire. Wildfire activity has not only been predicted to increase in the future under a climate warming scenario, but also such increases are hypothesized to bring about biogeographical shifts that reduce the resilience of fire-prone forests worldwide (Harvey et al., ). Although the relative contribution of fire to forest decline is greatest in the boreal forest, fire still represents a threat to temperate forests, especially conifer forests already weakened by drought (Hansen et al., ). Harvey et al.  tested two hypotheses associated with this observation in fire-prone subalpine (largely conifer) forests in the Rocky Mountains of the United States: (1) availability of viable seeds will decrease in large patches following stand-replacing fire, and (2) seedling establishment and survival will decline measurably following post-fire drought. They found that total tree seedling establishment declined sharply post-fire with greater drought severity and with greater distance to seed source. Many responses exhibited interspecific variation, suggesting fire/drought-induced changes in forest composition. They concluded that, given the predicted increase in frequency of drought and wildfire in the future, post-fire tree seedling establishment of these forests could be reduced substantially. Although some of these reductions might be offset by compensatory increases from lower montane and upper timberline species, important near- to mid-term shifts in the composition and structure of high-elevation forests will occur under continued climate warming and increased wildfire activity.Not part of their study, yet no less important, is the interaction of drought and fire with increases in extent and severity of forests pests, as discussed in Mitton & Ferrenberg  in North America and Netherer & Schopf  in Europe. That is, the scene depicted in Fig. (a) of wide swathes of insect-killed stems is of trees more susceptible to insect death because of drought stress, and simultaneously represents substantial fuel for intense fires. Furthermore, McDowell et al.  established a close connection between climate change-enhanced drought and increases in pests for temperate forests of North America.878V.V. EpilogueRegrettably, climate change has been insinuated into the current political arena - especially in the United States, but also elsewhere around the world - wherein agenda-driven politics seek to deny its scientific reality (I remind my students that mixing politics and science is like mixing manure and ice cream - it never helps the manure, but always ruins the ice cream). In spite of this, and to a real degree because of it, climate change will continue to threaten global ecosystems in general, and temperate forests in particular, for many years in the future. It is quite compelling that, in spite of misrepresentations to the contrary, numerous long-term predictions from the past regarding climate change have largely survived scientific scrutiny. Certainly, predictions of Hansen et al.  nearly 30 yr ago have all been essentially supported, especially regarding climate change-mediated extremes of weather (Fig. ).Climate change, however, is only a part, albeit the lion's share, of global change, comprising myriad other drivers, most of which have been exposited herein. Franklin et al.  developed a conceptual model of the effects of these drivers - climate change, altered disturbance regimes, invasive species/novel species assemblages, land-use change - on terrestrial ecosystems using multiple lines of evidence. These include observations for attribution, experiments for identifying mechanisms, and use of models at multiple scales of ecological organization for verification (Fig. ). Although this model was developed as a set of general guidelines for all ecosystems of the biosphere, it seems particularly applicable to temperate forests, considering (1) the chronic alteration of these forests by human populations, and (2) their temperate nature, wherein growing/dormant seasons are an integral part of their structure and function. Such a model provides a strong base not only for ongoing scientific inquiry and understanding, but also in informing mitigation policy. Although the science to date has provided sufficient evidence providing the impetus for policy changes, there is still a clear need for further basic scientific research. Climate change is unquestionably a complex phenomenon that can be best understood only by a complex of scientific approaches, involving empirical field monitoring, manipulative field experiments and laboratory simulations, all coupled with modeling (e.g. DeRose et al., ).Finally, I suspect that I am not alone among plant ecologists in considering Sir Arthur Tansley as a professional 'hero,' a truly inspirational visionary in our field, and one who clearly articulated many ecological concepts we embrace today. Although it is an honor to write a review bearing his name, I cannot imagine that he, in his day, would have conceived the truly global scale of our 'modern' alteration of climate. Still, he deeply appreciated the profoundly negative influence human activity can have on the very ecosystems that he not only 'coined,' but on which our sustainability depends. Appropriately, I allow Sir Arthur to conclude:It would be difficult, not to say impossible, to draw a natural line between the activities of the human tribes which presumably fitted into and formed parts of 'biotic communities' and the destructive human activities of the modern world...Regarded as an exceptionally powerful biotic factor which increasingly upsets the equilibrium of preexisting ecosystems and eventually destroys them, at the same time forming new ones of very different nature, human activity finds its proper place in ecology.

The purpose of this review is to bring into focus the diverse forests of the temperate region of the biosphere, including those of hardwood, conifer and mixed dominance, with a particular emphasis on crucial challenges for the future of these forested areas. Implicit in the term 'temperate' is that the predominant climate of these forest regions has distinct cyclic, seasonal changes involving periods of growth and dormancy. The specific temporal patterns of seasonal change, however, display an impressive variability among temperate forest regions. In addition to the more apparent current anthropogenic disturbances of temperate forests, such as forest management and conversion to agriculture, human alteration of temperate forests is actually an ancient phenomenon, going as far back as 7000 yr before present (bp). As deep-seated as these past legacies are for temperate forests, all current and future perturbations, including timber harvesting, excess nitrogen deposition, altered species' phenologies, and increasing frequency of drought and fire, must be viewed through the lens of climate change.",2016,"12-01","New Phytologist (Online)","212","4","871","","https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14255","","#25030","Gilliam 2016","Laura  Dee (2024-08-23 01:43:09)(Select): New Phytologist isnt a book; Anna LoPresti (2024-07-16 08:46:33)(Screen): are we including books?;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"239","Ecological impacts of invasive ecosystem engineers: A global perspective across terrestrial and aquatic systems","Rilov, Gil; João Canning‐Clode; Tamar Guy‐Haim","In both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, invasive species are a major driver of global change that is increasing in scope and impact due to the increase in global trade, habitat modification and climate change. Among invasive species, those that are known as ‘ecosystem engineers’ are considered a specific, highly influential, type of invaders, where an invader significantly alters the new environment, either physically or chemically. In this context, this perspective review discusses the different types of possible impacts of invasive ecosystems engineers (IEE) in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems.Scanning the relevant literature on the topic, we find a 12‐year lag in the use of terms relevant to the concept of ecosystem engineers in invasion‐related publications since the first publication of the concept in 1994, with a steep increase in use between 2006 and 2014. A bibliometric mapping showed a high level of connectedness between related terms and clusters, suggesting an ample flow of concepts, ideas and knowledge between realms, ecosystems and regions, and researchers that study them.Throughout this essay, we illustrate with recent examples the context‐dependency of their (positive and negative) impacts in the three realms. We review the distinction between autogenic (altering the environment for other species with their body) and allogenic (altering the environment for other species with their actions) ecosystem engineering in the context of alien species. We also put a spotlight on the well‐studied engineering effects of IEE plants and macroalgae, terrestrial and aquatic bioturbators and burrowers as well as highly effective consumers.We finalize with discussing how IEE can strongly affect ecosystem services for human wellbeing and explore the possible contribution of IEE in restoring functions and services in the face of climate change in highly invaded and fast‐warming systems like the southeastern Mediterranean Sea or areas that face frequent fires for example. We claim that the last topic has received little attention from the scientific community and should be given priority in future studies.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.",2024,"01-01","Functional Ecology","38","1","37-51","","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.14406","","#25250","Rilov 2024","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-23 06:45:45)(Select): Specific case examples of ecosystem engineers are transboundary: """"the red quinine tree, Cinchona pubescens, invaded the Galapagos Islands in the 1940s and since then spread in large areas of the highlands of Santa Cruz Island"""" (44).; ","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Relative to the evergreen species that currently dominate much of the boreal forest landscape, Larix (larch) distributions may be particularly responsive to climatic change due to their deciduous habit, and quick growth and reproduction. Here, we amassed data from 83 studies to describe and explain observed patterns of Larix range shifts under contemporary climate change.LocationNorthern hemisphere.TaxonSpecies of the genus Larix, deciduous gymnosperms.MethodsWith 181 observations of Larix range limit dynamics, we used five distribution parameters (tree line advance, stand infilling, tree line recession, stand thinning, no response) and their determinants (climate, land use change, natural disturbance) to describe and explain observed patterns of Larix range shifts under contemporary climate change. We ran a redundancy analysis on the matrix of five distribution parameters considered with other climatic and nonclimatic parameters as explanatory variables. We also characterized the climatic niche of Larix species (temperature and precipitation) and how the niche has changed during the 20th century.ResultsOf 173 sites studied over the full distribution of Larix, 63% experienced Larix population increases, 18% had population decreases, and no response was detected at 19% of sites. Latitudinal Larix tree lines in Siberia and North America appear to be infilling and shifting their distributions northward, whereas Larix recession and thinning was more common in southern regions, suggesting southern populations may be experiencing greater drought stress than their northern counterparts. Climatic niches of most Larix species shifted towards warmer and wetter conditions, with tree line advance/forest infilling in cool/dry climate space, and recession/thinning in warm/dry space.Main conclusionsNorthern expansion is underway or seems imminent for boreal Larix species, primarily L. laricina in North America. Retraction in southern regions and disappearance of some mountainous populations may be inevitable due to their narrow ecological niches. Species restricted to mountainous habitats may expand locally, though will likely not contribute to broad scale range expansion.

"241","Assessing the consequences of global change for forest disturbance from herbivores and pathogens","Ayres, M P; Lombardero, MJ","Herbivores and pathogens impact the species composition, ecosystem function, and socioeconomic value of forests. Herbivores and pathogens are an integral part of forests, but sometimes produce undesirable effects and a degradation of forest resources. In the United States, a few species of forest pests routinely have significant impacts on up to 20 million ha of forest with economic costs that probably exceed $1 billion/year. Climatic change could alter patterns of disturbance from herbivores and pathogens through: (1) direct effects on the development and survival of herbivores and pathogens; (2) physiological changes in tree defenses; and (3) indirect effects from changes in the abundance of natural enemies (e.g. parasitoids of insect herbivores), mutualists (e.g. insect vectors of tree pathogens), and competitors. Because of their short life cycles, mobility, reproductive potential, and physiological sensitivity to temperature, even modest climate change will have rapid impacts on the distribution and abundance of many forest insects and pathogens. We identify 32 syndromes of biotic disturbance in North American forests that should be carefully evaluated for their responses to climate change: 15 insect herbivores, browsing mammals; 12 pathogens; 1 plant parasite; and 3 undiagnosed patterns of forest decline. It is probable that climatic effects on some herbivores and pathogens will impact on biodiversity, recreation, property value, forest industry, and even water quality. Some scenarios are beneficial (e.g. decreased snow cover may increase winter mortality of some insect pests), but many are detrimental (e.g. warming tends to accelerate insect development rate and facilitate range expansions of pests and climate change tends to produce a mismatch between mature trees and their environment, which can increase vulnerability to herbivores and pathogens). Changes in forest disturbance can produce feedback to climate through affects on water and carbon flux in forest ecosystems; one alarming scenario is that climate warming may increase insect outbreaks in boreal forests, which would tend to increase forest fires and exacerbate further climate warming by releasing carbon stores from boreal ecosystems. We suggest a list of research priorities that will allow us to refine these risk assessments and adopt forest management strategies that anticipate changes in biotic disturbance regimes and mitigate the ecological, social, and economic risks.",2000,"11-15","Science of the Total Environment","262","3","263-286","","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0048-9697(00)00528-3","","#25577","Ayres 2000","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

(Guy Randall), 1960-; Weltzin, Jake F. http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n00005023","This review evaluates the effects and importance of disturbance and climate change on plant community dynamics in the United States/Mexico borderlands region. Our primary focus is on knowledge of physiognomic-level change in grasslands and woodlands of southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. Changes in vegetation physiognomy have broad implications for management and land use in the borderlands. Historically, livestock grazing and fire were the dominant disturbances in borderland ecosystems. Livestock grazing accelerates the rate of establishment and growth of woody plants (notably mesquite) in the borderlands region. However, the current role of livestock grazing in this region may be considerably less important than the historic role. Excluding livestock from grasslands now would not prevent, and may not delay, a substantial increase in woody plant abundance. In general, frequent fires are detrimental to woody plants and beneficial to Lehmann lovegrass. Although fires favor herbaceous plants at the expense of woody plants, woody plant dominance on many sites precludes the deliberate application of fire without first using chemical or mechanical treatments. Climate change is perhaps the most critical factor facing the current generation of land managers who are concerned about the future condition of borderlands ecosystems. Rising concentrations of CO₂ and other trace gases have the potential to replace grazing and fire suppression as important regulators of vegetation change. Increased atmospheric CO₂ concentrations may contribute to increased abundance of woody plants in borderlands grasslands, particularly if these increases are accompanied by shifts in seasonal precipitation or other climatic factors. Much of the knowledge garnered about borderlands plant communities is derived from descriptive research such as comparative studies and """"natural"""" experiments. This research has been valuable for documenting changes in vegetation and identifying candidate explanations for observed changes. However, because descriptive research is generally inappropriate for testing hypotheses, we outline and describe a strategy for hypothesis-testing and provide recommendations for future research in the borderlands.

Continued warming will be accompanied by changes in precipitation, which will vary across the country and seasons, and by increasing climate variability and extreme weather events. Climate change will likely drive the emergence of infectious diseases in Canada by northward spread from the United States and introduction from elsewhere in the world via air and sea transport. Diseases endemic to Canada are also likely to re-emerge. This special issue describes key infectious disease risks associated with climate change. These include emergence of tick-borne diseases in addition to Lyme disease, the possible introduction of exotic mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, more epidemics of Canada-endemic vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus, and increased incidence of foodborne illnesses. Risk is likely to be compounded by an aging population affected by chronic diseases, which results in greater sensitivity to infectious diseases.

"244","Provenance trials in the service of forestry assisted migration: A review of North American field trials and experiments","Park, Andrew; Rodgers, Jesse L","As greenhouse gas emissions rise unabated and temperatures continue to rise, forest managers have begun to consider assisted migration (AM) of trees as a strategy to adapt forests to climate change. To investigate the risks and benefits of AM, old provenance trials have been repurposed and new common-garden experiments initiated. In this paper, we review three decades of common-garden based research into the adaptation of species and provenances (geographically specific varieties) to current and future climates in North America. Using a filtered data base of 106 papers and reports, we investigate multiple aspects of this work, including subject species, tree response variables and their climatic predictors, statistical techniques, and the patterns of adaptation revealed in results. Although the reviewed work contained valuable insights into provenance-climate relationships, much of this work focused on growth in commercial conifer species and the correlation of that growth with annual or monthly climatic averages. A minority of studies investigated the effects of climate variables with direct mechanistic effects on growth or phenology, including temperature extremes, frost and drought indices, or growing-season duration.

"245","Microbial communities in natural and disturbed peatlands: A review","Andersen, R; Chapman, S J; Artz, R.R.E.","Even though large extents of boreal peatlands are still in a pristine condition, especially in North America, extensive areas have been affected by natural or anthropogenic disturbances that change some of the systems from being sinks to sources of carbon dioxide and shift the methane production/consumption patterns through alterations of both above- and below-ground communities and functions. In order to fully assess the role of peatlands on global C balance, now and in the future, it is imperative that we deepen our understanding of the relative contributions of various groups of microorganisms to organic matter transformations. Here, we review the drivers structuring fungal, bacterial and archaeal communities in natural peatlands and the response of these microbial communities to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, including fire, drainage, nutrient deposition, peat mining and climate change. The microbial diversity in peatlands is characterized by organisms that have developed physiological and metabolic adaptations to cope with the constraining conditions found in these ecosystems, such as low oxygen availability, cold temperature, acidity and oligotrophy. Furthermore, these unique organisms sometimes appear to be organized as repeat mosaics responding to vegetation, physico-chemical and hydrological characteristics more than to geographical distance, in other words, similar to the much valued biodiversity aspects of the peatland vegetation itself and associated higher organisms. The response of microbial communities to disturbances is far from fully understood. In particular, whilst many studies have identified changes in microbial community composition or on microbially driven processes following a given disturbance, it remains unclear how the two components, diversity and function, relate with each other. Future challenges involve designing studies that will test whether ecological theories like species sorting, stress physiology, temporal niche or functional redundancy can be used to understand what regulates microbial populations and activity in peatlands, and studies that will allow us to predict more accurately how peatlands respond to global change or anthropogenic disturbances.",2013,"02-01","Soil biology & biochemistry","57 p.979-994","","979-994","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.10.003","","#26097","Andersen 2013","Laura  Dee (2024-08-21 06:45:52)(Included): duplicate;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"246","Climate-Driven Reshuffling of Species and Genes: Potential Conservation Roles for Species Translocations and Recombinant Hybrid Genotypes","Scriber, Jon Mark"," Comprising 50%-75% of the world's fauna, insects are a prominent part of biodiversity in communities and ecosystems globally. Biodiversity across all levels of biological classifications is fundamentally based on genetic diversity. However, the integration of genomics and phylogenetics into conservation management may not be as rapid as climate change. The genetics of hybrid introgression as a source of novel variation for ecological divergence and evolutionary speciation (and resilience) may generate adaptive potential and diversity fast enough to respond to locally-altered environmental conditions. Major plant and herbivore hybrid zones with associated communities deserve conservation consideration. This review addresses functional genetics across multi-trophic-level interactions including """"invasive species"""" in various ecosystems as they may become disrupted in different ways by rapid climate change. """"Invasive genes"""" (into new species and populations) need to be recognized for their positive creative potential and addressed in conservation programs. """"Genetic rescue"""" via hybrid translocations may provide needed adaptive flexibility for rapid adaptation to environmental change. While concerns persist for some conservationists, this review emphasizes the positive aspects of hybrids and hybridization. Specific implications of natural genetic introgression are addressed with a few examples from butterflies, including transgressive phenotypes and climate-driven homoploid recombinant hybrid speciation. Some specific examples illustrate these points using the swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae) with their long-term historical data base (phylogeographical diversity changes) and recent (3-decade) climate-driven temporal and genetic divergence in recombinant homoploid hybrids and relatively recent hybrid speciation of Papilio appalachiensis in North America.

An outbreak of SNC began in coastal Oregon in the mid-1990s and has persisted since that time. Here we review the current state of knowledge after 24 years of research and monitoring, with a focus on Oregon, although the disease is significant in coastal Washington and has recently emerged in southwestern British Columbia. We present new insights into SNC distribution, landscape patterns, disease epidemiology and ecology, host-pathogen interactions, trophic and hydrologic influences, and the challenges of Douglas-fir plantation management in the presence of the disease. In Oregon, the SNC outbreak has remained geographically contained but has intensified. Finally, we consider the implications of climate change and other recently emerged foliage diseases on the future of Douglas-fir plantation management. Study Implications: Douglas-fir tree growers need to consider Swiss needle cast (SNC) and other emerging foliage diseases as SNC has not abated over the past 24 years, and along with other emerging diseases, it continues to pose a threat to Douglas-fir plantation productivity. Douglasfir management in western Oregon remains important, such that a knowledge of disease impacts and effective silvicultural responses is key. Managers should carefully consider whether alternative species may be ecologically or economically beneficial in some situations while tree improvement programs must continue to breed for tolerance to SNC. Research shows that regional scale foliage disease outbreaks can result in trophic cascades and hydrologic changes that affects more than just the trees.The environmental controls on the SNC epidemic imply that climate change could strongly influence future directions of the outbreak, with the greatest threats to trees at higher elevations.",2021,"07-01","Journal of Forestry","119","4","407-421","","https://doi.org/10.1093/jofore/fvab011","","#26712","Shaw 2021","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-27 06:20:32)(Select): Spread into CA <- transboundary;","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Data trends show global climate change effects ranging from increased oxygen consumption rates in fishes, to changes in foraging and migrational patterns in polar seas, to fish community changes in bleached tropical coral reefs. Projections of future conditions portend further impacts on the distribution and abundance of fishes associated with relatively small temperature changes. Changing fish distributions and abundances will undoubtedly affect communities of humans who harvest these stocks. Coastal-based harvesters (subsistence, commercial, recreational) may be impacted (negatively or positively) by changes in fish stocks due to climate change. Furthermore, marine protected area boundaries, low-lying island countries dependent on coastal economies, and disease incidence (in aquatic organisms and humans) are also affected by a relatively small increase in temperature and sea level. Our interpretations of evidence include many uncertainties about the future of affected fish species and their harvesters. Therefore, there is a need to research the physiology and ecology of marine and estuarine fishes, particularly in the tropics where comparatively little research has been conducted.

And, although historically the great majority of migration research has been conducted in the eastern half of the continent, there has been much recent progress on aspects of avian migration in the West. In particular, expanded use of techniques such as radar, plasma metabolites, mist-netting, count surveys, stable isotopes, genetic data, and animal tracking, coupled with an increase in multi-investigator collaborations, have all contributed to this growth of knowledge. There is increasing recognition that migration is likely the most limiting time of year for migratory birds, increasing the importance of continuing to decipher patterns of stopover ecology, identifying critical stopover habitats, and documenting migration routes in the diverse and changing landscapes of the American West. Here, we review and briefly synthesize the latest findings and advances in avian migration and consider research needs to guide future research on migration in the West.

"250","Impacts of climate warming on hybrid zone movement: Geographically diffuse and biologically porous aspecies bordersa","Scriber, JMark","Abstract The ecology and evolutionary biology of insect-plant associations has realized extensive attention, especially during the past 60 years. The classifications (categorical designations) of continuous variation in biodiversity, ranging from global patterns (e.g., latitudinal gradients in species richness/diversity and degree of herbivore feeding specialization) to localized insect-plant associations that span the biospectrum from polyphenisms, polymorphisms, biotypes, demes, host races, to cryptic species, remain academically contentious. Semantic and biosystematic (taxonomical) disagreements sometimes detract from more important ecological and evolutionary processes that drive diversification, the dynamics of gene flow and local extinctions. This review addresses several aspects of insect specialization, host-associated divergence and ecological (including """"hybrid"""") speciation, with special reference to the climate warming impacts on species borders of hybridizing swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae). Interspecific hybrid introgression may result in collapse of multi-species communities or increase species numbers via homoploid hybrid speciation. We may see diverging, merging, or emerging genotypes across hybrid zones, all part of the ongoing processes of evolution. Molecular analyses of genetic mosaics and genomic dynamics with """"divergence hitchhiking"""", combined with ecological, ethological and physiological studies of """"species porosity"""", have already begun to unveil some answers for some important ecological/evolutionary questions. (i) How rapidly can host-associated divergence lead to new species (and why doesn't it always do so, e.g., resulting in """"incomplete"""" speciation)? (ii) How might """"speciation genes"""" function, and how/where would we find them? (iii) Can oscillations from specialists to generalists and back to specialists help explain global diversity in herbivorous insects? (iv) How could recombinant interspecific hybridization lead to divergence and speciation? From ancient phytochemically defined angiosperm affiliations to recent and very local geographical mosaics, the Papilionidae (swallowtail butterflies) have provided a model for enhanced understanding of ecological patterns and evolutionary processes, including host-associated genetic divergence, genomic mosaics, genetic hitchhiking and sex-linked speciation genes. Apparent homoploid hybrid speciation in Papilio appears to have been catalyzed by climate warming-induced interspecific introgression of some, but not all, species diagnostic traits, reflecting strong divergent selection (discordant), especially on the Z (= X) chromosome. Reproductive isolation of these novel recombinant hybrid genotypes appears to be accomplished via a delayed post-diapause emergence or temporal isolation, and is perhaps aided by the thermal landscape. Changing thermal landscapes appear to have created (and may destroy) novel recombinant hybrid genotypes and hybrid species.",2011,"04-01","Insect Science","18","2","121-159","","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7917.2010.01367.x","","#27059","Scriber 2011","Grace Westphal (2024-08-16 03:57:42)(Select): Transboundary discussion is limited to US and Canada (mentioned only once), but the ideas in here about range limits / traits based on climates seems broadly useful; ","Biotic; Transboundary unclear; save for other sections",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"251","The Migratory Timing of Adult Summer-Run Steelhead in the Columbia River over Six Decades of Environmental Change","Robards, MD; Quinn, T P","Anadromous fishes achieve most of their lifetime growth at sea before returning to spawn in freshwater. However, populations of some species enter freshwater many months before spawning, apparently compromising growth opportunities at sea to access spawning grounds in conjunction with specific seasonal patterns of flow and temperature along the migratory route. The nutritional benefits of overwintering in the ocean may also be outweighed by a relatively dormant winter in colder river habitats. Modification of the thermal and hydrologic regimes of rivers (such as the Columbia River during the 20th century) might be expected to affect the abundance and life history patterns of such populations. This study reviews information on the migratory timing, abundance, and composition (wild versus hatchery) of summer-run (upriver) populations of steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Columbia River basin with reference to environmental changes. Despite pronounced changes in the river's environment, the late summer migration-spring spawning persists as an overall pattern as it passes Bonneville Dam (the lowest on the Columbia River). However, the historic summer run's distinct bimodality (with early and late components) has gradually become unimodal. Upriver, other complex changes have taken place in migration timing: it now occurs earlier through some reaches of the river and periods of time, reflecting both the uneven physical changes over time and the complex behavior and population structure of steelhead. We were unable, therefore, to isolate the causal mechanisms or disentangle natural from anthropogenic influences. However, our research suggests that the change in the migration pattern for summer-run steelhead reflects a response to the challenges presented by a changing environment (temperature and flow) to genetically controlled life history patterns, the relative abundance of component populations, and the relative proportion of populations derived from hatchery production (which lately [1984-1999] accounted for an average 74% of the early run and 85% of the late run).",2002,"06-01","Transactions of the American Fisheries Society","131","3","523-536","","","","#27227","Robards 2002","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-08-23 02:13:17)(Select): Columbia River runs across US-Canada border; reasonable transboundary assumption ;","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and extent of community reorganization remains elusive. This is particularly true in riverine systems, which are simultaneously exposed to changing temperature and streamflow, and where land-use change continues to be a major driver of biodiversity loss. Here, we use the most comprehensive compilation of fish abundance time series to date to provide a global synthesis of climate- and LU-induced effects on riverine biota with respect to changes in species thermal and streamflow affinities. We demonstrate that fish communities are increasingly dominated by thermophilic (warm-water) and limnophilic (slow-water) species. Despite being consistent with trends in water temperature and streamflow observed over recent decades, these community changes appear largely decoupled from each other and show wide spatial variation. We further reveal a synergy among climate- and land use-related drivers, such that community thermophilization is heightened in more human-modified systems. Importantly, communities in which species experience thermal and flow regimes that approach or exceed their tolerance thresholds (high community sensitivity), as well as species-poor communities (low community resilience), also display faster rates of compositional change. This research illustrates that quantifying vulnerability of riverine systems to climate change requires a broadening from a narrower thermal focus to more integrative approaches that account for the spatially varying and multifaceted sensitivity of riverine organisms to the interactive effects of water temperature, hydrology, and other anthropogenic changes.",2021,"07-06","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","118","27","","","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011639118","","#27739","Comte 2021","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Climate change further increases outbreak risks by altering pathogen evolution and host–pathogen interactions and facilitating the emergence of new pathogenic strains. Pathogen range can shift, increasing the spread of plant diseases in new areas. In this Review, we examine how plant disease pressures are likely to change under future climate scenarios and how these changes will relate to plant productivity in natural and agricultural ecosystems. We explore current and future impacts of climate change on pathogen biogeography, disease incidence and severity, and their effects on natural ecosystems, agriculture and food production. We propose that amendment of the current conceptual framework and incorporation of eco-evolutionary theories into research could improve our mechanistic understanding and prediction of pathogen spread in future climates, to mitigate the future risk of disease outbreaks. We highlight the need for a science–policy interface that works closely with relevant intergovernmental organizations to provide effective monitoring and management of plant disease under future climate scenarios, to ensure long-term food and nutrient security and sustainability of natural ecosystems.In this Review, Singh et al. explore the impact of future climate scenarios on plant pathogen burden and biogeography, their interaction with the plant microbiome and the consequences on plant disease and productivity in different ecosystems.

From a review of the major pest snail and slug literature, together with our own experience, we developed a preliminary list of gastropod species displaying significant potential to damage natural ecosystems or agriculture, or human health or commerce, and either entirely absent from the United States to our knowledge or restricted to narrow areas of introduction. Comments on the list from the worldwide malacological community were then solicited and led us to modify the original list. We then evaluated the taxa on this list by ranking them according to 12 attributes--seven biological variables and five aspects of human interaction--based on thorough review of the detailed literature. The ranked list that emerged from this risk assessment process included 46 taxa (species or species-groups) in 18 families. The highest ranked taxa were in the Ampullariidae, Hygromiidae, Cochlicellidae, Helicidae, Veronicellidae, Succineidae, Achatinidae, and Planorbidae. We validated the risk assessment model by scoring a suite of non-native snail and slug species already present in the United States. The list is not definitive but rather is offered as a framework for additional research.

"256","Context dependency of animal resource subsidies.","Subalusky, Amanda L; Post, David M","The transport of resource subsidies by animals has been documented across a range of species and ecosystems. Although many of these studies have shown that animal resource subsidies can have significant effects on nutrient cycling, ecosystem productivity, and food-web structure, there is a great deal of variability in the occurrence and strength of these effects. Here we propose a conceptual framework for understanding the context dependency of animal resource subsidies, and for developing and testing predictions about the effects of animal subsidies over space and time. We propose a general framework, in which abiotic characteristics and animal vector characteristics from the donor ecosystem interact to determine the quantity, quality, timing, and duration (QQTD) of an animal input. The animal input is translated through the lens of recipient ecosystem characteristics, which include both abiotic and consumer characteristics, to yield the QQTD of the subsidy. The translated subsidy influences recipient ecosystem dynamics through effects on both trophic structure and ecosystem function, which may both influence the recipient ecosystem's response to further inputs and feed back to influence the donor ecosystem. We present a review of research on animal resource subsidies across ecosystem boundaries, placed within the context of this framework, and we discuss how the QQTD of resource subsidies can influence trophic structure and ecosystem function in recipient ecosystems. We explore the importance of understanding context dependency of animal resource subsidies in increasingly altered ecosystems, in which the characteristics of both animal vectors and donor and recipient ecosystems may be changing rapidly. Finally, we make recommendations for future research on animal resource subsidies, and resource subsidies in general, that will increase our understanding and predictive capacity about their ecosystem effects.",2019,"04-01","Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society","94","2","517-538","","https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12465","","#28864","Subalusky 2019","Laura  Dee (2024-10-18 08:31:27)(Select): GREAT background for the chapter, agree not very specific to North America but the framework and types of biotic flows are relevant; Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-17 12:48:57)(Select): There is not enough specific examples to be useful for transboundary.
