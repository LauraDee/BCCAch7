"1",5,"A Systematic Review of the Effects of Temperature on <i>Anopheles</i> Mosquito Development and Survival: Implications for Malaria Control in a Future Warmer Climate","Agyekum, T. P.; Botwe, P. K.; Arko-Mensah, J.; Issah, I.; Acquah, A. A.; Hogarh, J. N.; Dwomoh, D.; Robins, T. G.; Fobil, J. N.","The rearing temperature of the immature stages can have a significant impact on the life-history traits and the ability of adult mosquitoes to transmit diseases. This review assessed published evidence of the effects of temperature on the immature stages, life-history traits, insecticide susceptibility, and expression of enzymes in the adult Anopheles mosquito. Original articles published through 31 March 2021 were systematically retrieved from Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. After applying eligibility criteria, 29 studies were included. The review revealed that immature stages of An. arabiensis were more tolerant (in terms of survival) to a higher temperature than An. funestus and An. quadriannulatus. Higher temperatures resulted in smaller larval sizes and decreased hatching and pupation time. The development rate and survival of An. stephensi was significantly reduced at a higher temperature than a lower temperature. Increasing temperatures decreased the longevity, body size, length of the gonotrophic cycle, and fecundity of Anopheles mosquitoes. Higher rearing temperatures increased pyrethroid resistance in adults of the An. arabiensis SENN DDT strain, and increased pyrethroid tolerance in the An. arabiensis SENN strain. Increasing temperature also significantly increased Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) expression and decreased insecticide toxicity. Both extreme low and high temperatures affect Anopheles mosquito development and survival. Climate change could have diverse effects on Anopheles mosquitoes. The sensitivities of Anopeheles mosquitoes to temperature differ from species to species, even among the same complex. Notwithstanding, there seem to be limited studies on the effects of temperature on adult life-history traits of Anopheles mosquitoes, and more studies are needed to clarify this relationship.",2021,"JUL","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","18","14","","WOS:000677349100001","10.3390/ijerph18147255","","#154","Agyekum 2021","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-10 06:47:59)(Select): some of the papers reviewed are from north america (see figure 2). paper touches on northward shifting disease vectors, transboundary in North America is implicit but not explicit; ","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

J.; Ruiz-Sánchez, A.","Of the approximately 716 bird species that breed in North America, 386 (54%) are considered Nearctic-Neotropical migrants by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In the past 50 yr, scores of these migratory species, including some once considered common, have declined dramatically. Nearctic-Neotropical migrants normally spend 6-8 months in tropical habitats, making the identification, availability, and management of Neotropical habitats critical issues for their conservation. Yet, for most species, complete and nuanced information about their use of tropical habitats and the relative effects of breeding vs. wintering conditions on survival, productivity, and population trends is not available, though many studies point to Neotropical overwintering habitats as being a strong driver of population change. Particularly important for long-distance Nearctic-Neotropical migrants is an understanding of how""""""""carry-over effects"""""""" arise and influence population trends when conditions on wintering grounds and tropical stopover areas affect subsequent reproductive performance on breeding grounds. For example, why some species show strong carry-over effects from tropical habitats while others do not is not fully understood. I n recent years, many studies have offered insights into these issues by taking advantage of new scientific methods and technological innovations. In this review, we explore threats facing North American breeding birds that migrate to the Neotropics, summarize knowledge of habitat selection and use on the wintering grounds, describe how conditions at one point in the annual cycle may manifest in subsequent seasons or life history stages, and discuss conservation concerns such as climate change and the potential for phenological mismatch.",2020,"NOV","Condor","122","4","","WOS:000612517800020","10.1093/condor/duaa055","","#269","Albert 2020","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

"4",20,"Assessing global biome exposure to climate change through the Holocene-Anthropocene transition","Benito-Garzón, M.; Leadley, P. W.; Fernández-Manjarrés, J. F.","AimTo analyse global patterns of climate during the mid-Holocene and conduct comparisons with pre-industrial and projected future climates. In particular, to assess the exposure of terrestrial biomes and ecoregions to climate-related risks during the Holocene-Anthropocene transition starting at the pre-industrial period. LocationTerrestrial ecosystems of the Earth. MethodsWe calculated long-term climate differences (anomalies) between the mid-Holocene (6 ka cal bp, mH), pre-industrial conditions and projections for 2100 (middle-strength A1B scenario) using six global circulation models available for all periods. Climate differences were synthesized with multivariate statistics and average principal component loadings of temperature and precipitation differences (an estimate of climate-related risks) were calculated on 14 biomes and 766 ecoregions. ResultsOur results suggest that most of the Earth's biomes will probably undergo changes beyond the mH recorded levels of community turnover and range shifts because the magnitude of climate anomalies expected in the future are greater than observed during the mH. A few biomes, like the remnants of North American and Euro-Asian prairies, may experience only slightly greater degrees of climate change in the future as compared with the mH. In addition to recent studies that have identified equatorial regions as the most sensitive to future climate change, we find that boreal forest, tundra and vegetation of the Equatorial Andes could be at greatest risk, since these regions will be exposed to future climates that are well outside natural climate variation during the Holocene. ConclusionsThe Holocene-Anthropocene climate transition, even for a middle-strength future climate change scenario, appears to be of greater magnitude and different from that between the mH and the pre-industrial period. As a consequence, community- and biome-level changes due to of expected climate change may be different in the future from those observed during the mH.",2014,"FEB","Global Ecology and Biogeography","23","2","235-244","WOS:000329139600010","10.1111/geb.12097","","#1063","Benito-Garzón 2014","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"5",24,"Dieback of riparian alder caused by the <i>Phytophthora alni</i> complex: projected consequences for stream ecosystems","Bjelke, U.; Boberg, J.; Oliva, J.; Tattersdill, K.; McKie, B. G.","Alder trees (Alnus spp.) are key nitrogen-fixing riparian species in the northern hemisphere. Inputs of nitrogen-rich leaf litter from alder into stream food webs can contribute significantly to nitrogen dynamics at local and landscape scales. Alder trees also provide habitats for terrestrial and aquatic organisms, and help stabilize river banks. Recently, substantial declines in alder stands have occurred along streams in Europe, with damages observed in some parts of North America also. A major driver has been the invasive oomycete pathogen Phytophthora alni species complex, which can spread rapidly along stream networks. This review synthesises information on the pathogen, processes of spread and infection, and its impacts on alder. We further address the potential ecosystem-level and management consequences of the decline of alder, and highlight research needs. The alder dieback caused by P. alni is associated with reductions in shade and quality and quantity of leaf litter. A decline in the structural integrity of branches and roots further threatens bank stability. Stream banks dominated by other tree species or no trees at all will result in ecosystem-level changes both above and below the waterline. The P. alni taxonomic complex includes different species with varying phenotypes. An improved understanding of their environmental tolerances, virulence and evolution, along with the processes regulating the spread and impacts of the pathogen, would assist in identification of the riparian and stream systems most vulnerable not only to invasion but also to the heaviest disease outbreaks and ecosystem-level impacts. Within the P. alni complex, the highly pathogenic hybrid species P. x alni is favoured by mild winters and warm, but not excessively hot summer temperatures suggesting possible changes in distribution and level of impact under future global climate change.",2016,"MAY","Freshwater Biology","61","5","565-579","WOS:000373833400001","10.1111/fwb.12729","","#1231","Bjelke 2016","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The aquatic plants of the genus Elodea are potential invaders to Arctic and Subarctic ecosystems circumpolar and at least one species is already established in Alaska, USA. To illustrate the problems of preventing, eradicating, containing, and mitigating aquatic, invasive plants in Arctic and Subarctic ecosystems, we review the invasion dynamics of Elodea and provide recommendations for research and management efforts in Alaska. Foremost, we conclude the remoteness of Arctic and Subarctic systems such as Alaska is no longer a protective attribute against invasions, as transportation pathways now reach throughout these regions.

T.","Barnacles are some of the most conspicuous and well-known ship fouling organisms in the world and thus many species no doubt owe parts of their modern distribution to human-mediated translocations over the past several centuries. Reviewed here, as a window into global patterns, are the introduced, cryptogenic, and range expanding barnacles of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North and South America. Five species of thoracic barnacles have invaded the Pacific coasts of the Americas: Amphibalanus improvisus, A. eburneus, and A. subalbidus, all from the Atlantic, and A. amphitrite and A. reticulatus from the Indo-West Pacific. Seven species have invaded the Atlantic coasts of the Americas; six of these are from the Pacific: A. amphitrite and A. reticulatus (shared as invaders with the Pacific coast), and Balanus trigonus, B. glandula, Striatobalanus amaryllis, and Megabalanus coccopoma. The Western North Atlantic A. subalbidus has invaded the Western South Atlantic. Striking are the few barnacle invasions that have occurred on the Pacific coast of South America and these species (A. improvisus, A. amphitrite and A. reticulatus) are reported only from northernmost locations (Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru). For the first 100 years (1853-1955) two species, A. amphitrite and A. improvisus, constituted the majority of invasion events in the Americas, the sole exception being the arrival of the Pacific Balanus trigonus in the 1860s and 1870s in the Atlantic. After 1955, the first records of invasions of A. reticulatus, A. eburneus, B. glandula, M. coccopoma, and S. amaryllis appear, an increased diversity of introductions in close concert with general observations of increasing invasions globally of marine organisms after World War II. Known since the 1970s in Brazil, M. coccopoma appears to be responding to warming northern latitudes and has expanded to North Carolina as of 2005. The native Western Atlantic barnacle Chthamalus fragilis arrived in New England in the 1890s, a range expansion perhaps facilitated by an earlier coastal warming period concomitant with the decline in abundance of its colder-water competitor Semibalanus balanoides, although the latter also appears to have expanded south on the North American Atlantic coast in the twentieth century due to increased habitat availability. Chthamalus is predicted to move north, and Semibalanus is predicted to return to its historical range, both due to continued warming. In turn, the native Eastern North Pacific barnacle Tetraclita rubescens is expanding north due to coastal warming as well. Future invasion scenarios include increased introductions facilitated through a newly expanded Panama Canal, the potential arrival of Austrominius modestus on the North American Atlantic coast (despite its failure to do so throughout the last half of the twentieth century), and the arrival on the warmer North and Central American Pacific coasts of Chthamalus proteus.",2011,"","IN THE WRONG PLACE - ALIEN MARINE CRUSTACEANS: DISTRIBUTION, BIOLOGY AND IMPACTS","6","","159-213","WOS:000293984800005","10.1007/978-94-007-0591-3_510.1007/978-94-007-0591-3","","#1852","Carlton 2011","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

A.","Arctic warming is occurring at amuch faster rate than in other parts of the globe, with potentially devastating consequences for the diverse array of species within ecologically and biologically sensitive areas in the Arctic marine region. However, climate change research in this region is sparse compared to other biomes, hindering conservation efforts. In this article, we review and synthesize the available literature to understand the observed and potential impacts of climate change on different species and ecosystems in the Arctic marine region. We reviewed 253 articles reporting changes in species and ecosystems in the Arctic marine region in response to climate change (225 studies documenting observed impacts and 28 reporting predicted impacts). The review revealed that most research effort has been concentrated in only a subset of Arctic Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) (5/18 LMEs), with the majority of Arctic LMEs being poorly studied. The majority of the reviewed papers focused on marine mammals (19%) followed by microalgae (17%). A number of studies documented variability in planktonic communities (microalgae, macroalgae, zooplankton), resulting in alteration in ecosystem structure and function. Reproductive failure, decline in populations, and changes in diet composition, behavior, and breeding biology were reported for sea birds and mammals. Further, shifts in spatial distribution of fishes were observed by several studies. This review provides persuasive evidence that multiple climate change indices in the Arctic region are changing, with impacts on almost all components of marine biotic ecosystems (from plankton to top predators). We identify a number of gaps (such as limited inventory of biota, robustness of data supporting climate change indices on an Arctic Ocean scale, and climate suitability assessment for all species) in climate change research in Arctic marine ecosystems where future studies can help to quantify the impacts of climate change on species and ecosystems and advance understanding for their adaptive management.",2023,"SEP","Environmental Reviews","31","3","403-451","WOS:000963001200001","10.1139/er-2022-0101","","#2881","Deb 2023","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-19 04:28:12)(Select): This definitely relates to biodiversity + climate change.

Because of a coincidence of high species richness and human presence, Mediterranean biodiversity is particularly threatened by processes such as habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss, pollution, climate change and introduction of invasive species. Invasive tree pathogens are among the problematic exotic species of California, Chile, the Mediterranean, South Africa and Australia. In this review, we provide an update on a selection of non-native tree pathogens currently posing a threat in Mediterranean ecosystems. The impact of exotic forest pathogens range from large-scale tree and shrub mortality in native ecosystems (Phytophthora ramorum on the West Coast of the USA) to disruption of plantations of exotic (e.g., Seiridium cardinale on planted Monterey cypress in California, Fusarium circinatum on Monterey pine worldwide) and native trees (introduction of the North American Heterobasidion irregulare in stone pine woodland in Italy). Genetic analyses are instrumental in improving our understanding and management of these outbreaks. There is a need for more empirical data on how novel pathosystems are likely to develop under novel climates, as well as interdisciplinary collaborations among forest pathologists, theoretical modellers and climatologists.

S.; Hotaling, S.","Rapid recession of glaciers and snowfields is threatening the habitats of cold-water biodiversity worldwide. In many ice-sourced headwaters of western North America, stoneflies in the genus Lednia (Plecoptera: Nemouridae) are a prominent member of the invertebrate community. With a broad distribution in mountain streams and close ties to declining glacier cover, Lednia has emerged as a sentinel of climate change threats to high-elevation aquatic biodiversity. Lednia tumana, which is endemic to Glacier National Park, USA and the surrounding mountains, is the most well-studied species in the genus and in 2019 became federally protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) due to climate-induced loss of meltwater habitats. Three other Lednia species have also been described, and like L. tumana, each is endemic to a mountain region of western North America: Lednia sierra in the Sierra Nevada, Lednia borealis in the Cascade Range, and Lednia tetonica in the Teton Range. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of Lednia ecology, genetics, and physiology, with an emphasis on the conservation outlook for the group and species with similar headwater distributions. We highlight substantial progress made in the last decade to better understand the ecology and evolution of Lednia, including the identification of 140 Lednia-containing streams (an increase from 12 streams in 2010), and a more complete understanding of the degree to which warming streams may imperil species in the genus. In light of the ESA listing of L. tumana, we show that similar conservation threats likely face all extant Lednia species. However, substantial gaps in our knowledge remain, primarily centering around their distributions (and the potential for as yet undescribed species), life history, ecophysiology, and trophic ecology.

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the ecophysiological effects of groundwater drawdown on phreatophytes and methodological approaches were synthesized from peer-reviewed articles published from 1988 to 2022. The highest relative count of studies was found in arid and semi-arid high-income countries, such as Australia and North America (18-24%), while the lowest relative count to no data was found in hyper-arid countries, such as north African countries (0-3.65%). The groundwater depth effects on phreatophyte ecophysiology had the highest relative count (53.65%), followed by large-scale tree plantation effects on the groundwater characteristics (44.37%) and groundwater depth and biological invasion relationship (1.99%). The results revealed that as the groundwater depth increased, the phreatophytic vegetation growth, productivity, and community structure decreased across the ecosystem types. A groundwater withdrawal also had a significant impact on the physiology of the phreatophytes, specifically on the transpiration rate, xylem water potential, hydraulic conductance, and photosynthetic rate. Many of the reviewed studies concluded that large-scale tree plantations can deplete groundwater resources due to an increased evapotranspiration rate. Further, species' diversity, evenness, dominance, composition, and distribution, as well as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), are commonly measured parameters in the reviewed studies through vegetation and groundwater monitoring.

As fire regimes change, it is important to understand how mammals respond to these altered post-fire landscapes. Because fires vary in size, severity and landscape context, it is important to know the experimental designs and response variables used to address post-fire responses of mammals. We analysed 48 papers published from 1988 to 2015 that examined responses of small mammals to natural or prescribed fire in North American conifer forests. These papers used different experimental contrasts (e.g. burned vs unburned sites, time series, within-fire heterogeneity). Most studies (89.6%) presented species richness or index-derived abundances of common species as their response variable(s). Many studies did not fully describe the fires being examined; these omissions make it more difficult to interpret and compare results among studies. The limited scope of inference presented by the papers in this review leads us to recommend a minimal set of information that should be presented about each fire studied.

During the past decade, this viral disease has become a real threat for countries of the Mediterranean basin, with the recent occurrence of several important outbreaks in livestock. Moreover, the European Union registered the first cases of EHDV ever detected within its territory. Competent vectors involved in viral transmission, Culicoides midges, are expanding its distribution, conceivably due to global climate change. Therefore, livestock and wild ruminants around the globe are at risk for this serious disease. This review provides an overview of current knowledge about EHDV, including changes of distribution and virulence, an examination of different animal models of disease, and a discussion about potential treatments to control the disease.",2023,"MAY 19","Microorganisms","11","5","","WOS:000998132700001","10.3390/microorganisms11051339","","#5764","Jimenez-Cabello 2023","Dayo Osinubi (2024-08-09 08:07:37)(Select): Particular relevance to One Health (Environmental and Animal Health);","Biotic; Potentially relevant; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

M.","Vector-borne disease incidence and burden are on the rise. Weather events and climate patterns are known to influence vector populations and disease distribution and incidence. Changes in weather trends and climatic factors can shift seasonal vector activity and host behavior, thus altering pathogen distribution and introducing diseases to new geographic regions. With the upward trend in global temperature, changes in the incidence and distribution of disease vectors possibly linked to climate change have been documented. Forecasting and modeling efforts are valuable for incorporating climate into predicting changes in vector and vector-borne disease distribution. These predictions serve to optimize disease outbreak preparedness and response. The purpose of this scoping review was to describe the use of climate data in vector-borne disease prediction in North America between 2000 and 2022. The most investigated diseases were West Nile virus infection, Lyme disease, and dengue. The uneven geographical distribution of publications could suggest regional differences in the availability of surveillance data required for vector-borne disease predictions and forecasts across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Studies incorporated environmental data from ground-based sources, satellite data, previously existing data, and field-collected data. While environmental data such as meteorological and topographic factors were well-represented, further research is warranted to ascertain if relationships with less common variables, such as oceanographic characteristics and drought, hold among various vector populations and throughout wider geographical areas.

Environmental changes in human disturbance, land use and climate are predicted to have widespread impacts on interactions between species, especially in the order Lagomorpha due to the higher latitudes and more extreme environmental conditions they occupy. We reviewed the published literature on interspecific interactions in the order Lagomorpha and compared the biogeography, macroecology, phylogeny and traits of species known to interact with those of species with no reported interactions, to investigate how projected future environmental change may affect interactions and potentially alter species' distributions. Thirty-three lagomorph species have competitive interactions reported in the literature; the majority involve hares (Lepus sp.) or the eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus). Key regions for interactions are located between 30-50 degrees N of the Equator, and include eastern Asia (southern Russia on the border of Mongolia) and North America (north-western USA). Closely related, large-bodied, similarly sized species occurring in regions of human-modified, typically agricultural landscapes, or at high elevations, are significantly more likely to have reported competitive interactions than other lagomorph species. We identify species' traits associated with competitive interactions, and highlight some potential impacts that future environmental change may have on interspecific interactions. Our approach using bibliometric and biological data is widely applicable, and with relatively straightforward methodologies, can provide insights into interactions between species.

R.","Patterns of woody-plant mortality have been linked to global-scale environmental changes, such as extreme drought, heat stress, more frequent and intense fires, and episodic outbreaks of insects and pathogens. Although many studies have focussed on survival and mortality in response to specific physiological stresses, little attention has been paid to the role of genetic heritability of traits and local adaptation in influencing patterns of plant mortality, especially in non-native species. Tamarix spp. is a dominant, non-native riparian tree in western North America that is experiencing dieback in some areas of its range due to episodic herbivory by the recently introduced northern tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda carinulata). We propose that genotype x environment interactions largely underpin current and future patterns of Tamarix mortality. We anticipate that (i) despite its recent introduction, and the potential for significant gene flow, Tamarix in western North America is generally adapted to local environmental conditions across its current range in part due to hybridization of two species; (ii) local adaptation to specific climate, soil and resource availability will yield predictable responses to episodic herbivory; and (iii) the ability to cope with a combination of episodic herbivory and increased aridity associated with climate change will be largely based on functional tradeoffs in resource allocation. This review focusses on the potential heritability of plant carbon allocation patterns in Tamarix, focussing on the relative contribution of acquired carbon to non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools versus other sinks as the basis for surviving episodic disturbance. Where high aridity and/or poor edaphic position lead to chronic stress, NSC pools may fall below a minimum threshold because of an imbalance between the supply of carbon and its demand by various sinks. Identifying patterns of local adaptation of traits related to resource allocation will improve forecasting of Tamarix population susceptibility to episodic herbivory.",2017,"MAR 28","Conservation Physiology","5","","","WOS:000402600900001","10.1093/conphys/cox016","","#7357","Long 2017","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-16 07:09:31)(Select): including, as paper mentions southwestern USA and northern Mexico; Dayo Osinubi (2024-08-11 04:25:57)(Select): Review of local adaptations in an introduced or invasive plant species (Tamarix).

M.","Pinus strobiformis (southwestern white pine) is one of the least studied and understood five-needle white pine species in North America. Recently, this species has become increasingly challenged by Cronartium ribicola (white pine blister rust). This review examines literature relevant to P. strobiformis taxonomy, environmental associations, community associations, stand dynamics, and fire and disturbance ecology in order to better inform the management of this understudied species. In its US range, P. strobiformis occurs in central and southern Arizona and New Mexico and western Texas and has been documented as far north as southwestern Colorado. In Mexico, it occurs in northeastern Sonora, western Chihuahua and Durango, northern Zacatecas, southern Coahuila and central Nuevo Leon. Although P. strobiformis is a relatively high-elevation species preferring mesic habitats, it occurs across a variety of aspects, slope positions, and elevations. It rarely dominates forest composition but is most often found in complex species mixtures. While located in mixed-conifer habitats at the northern end of its range, it is associated with more diverse forest communities in the southern part of its range. Studies generally indicate P. strobiformis is a mid-seral species, although its low abundance and broad environmental amplitude complicate classification. Regeneration ecology is poorly understood, but bird and rodent seed dispersal do occur in portions of its range. Historical fire regimes in P. strobiformis mixed-conifer forests in the US were primarily characterized by frequent, low-severity surface fire, with less evidence of mixed- and high-severity fire. In Mexico, low-severity surface fire appears to have been ubiquitous within P. strobiformis habitats, with historical fire regimes still largely intact. Information is limited on the effects of disturbances other than fire. Increased temperatures and drought severity associated with climate change could potentially shrink the distribution of P. strobiformis, while altering its dominance in future forest communities. Future research on the ecology and management of P. strobiformis is necessary to effectively manage this species given climate change and white pine blister rust selection pressure.

P.","Aim Recent and rapid warming is reorganizing terrestrial vegetation, creating novel species assemblages, and shifting range limits. Relative to the evergreen species that currently dominate much of the boreal forest landscape, Larix (larch) distributions may be particularly responsive to climatic change due to their deciduous habit, and quick growth and reproduction. Here, we amassed data from 83 studies to describe and explain observed patterns of Larix range shifts under contemporary climate change. Location Northern hemisphere. Taxon Species of the genus Larix, deciduous gymnosperms. Methods With 181 observations of Larix range limit dynamics, we used five distribution parameters (tree line advance, stand infilling, tree line recession, stand thinning, no response) and their determinants (climate, land use change, natural disturbance) to describe and explain observed patterns of Larix range shifts under contemporary climate change. We ran a redundancy analysis on the matrix of five distribution parameters considered with other climatic and nonclimatic parameters as explanatory variables. We also characterized the climatic niche of Larix species (temperature and precipitation) and how the niche has changed during the 20th century. Results Of 173 sites studied over the full distribution of Larix, 63% experienced Larix population increases, 18% had population decreases, and no response was detected at 19% of sites. Latitudinal Larix tree lines in Siberia and North America appear to be infilling and shifting their distributions northward, whereas Larix recession and thinning was more common in southern regions, suggesting southern populations may be experiencing greater drought stress than their northern counterparts. Climatic niches of most Larix species shifted towards warmer and wetter conditions, with tree line advance/forest infilling in cool/dry climate space, and recession/thinning in warm/dry space. Main conclusions Northern expansion is underway or seems imminent for boreal Larix species, primarily L. laricina in North America. Retraction in southern regions and disappearance of some mountainous populations may be inevitable due to their narrow ecological niches. Species restricted to mountainous habitats may expand locally, though will likely not contribute to broad scale range expansion.

P.; Erickson, T.","Introduction Climate change has been scientifically documented, and its effects on wildlife have been prognosticated. We sought to predict the overall impact of climate change on venomous terrestrial species. We hypothesize that given the close relationship between terrestrial venomous species and climate, a changing global environment may result in increased species migration, geographical redistribution, and longer seasons for envenomation, which would have repercussions on human health. Methods A retrospective analysis of environmental, ecological, and medical literature was performed with a focus on climate change, toxinology, and future modeling specific to venomous terrestrial creatures. Species included venomous reptiles, snakes, arthropods, spiders, and Hymenoptera (ants and bees). Animals that are vectors of hemorrhagic infectious disease (eg, mosquitos, ticks) were excluded. Results Our review of the literature indicates that changes to climatic norms will have a potentially dramatic effect on terrestrial venomous creatures. Empirical evidence demonstrates that geographic distributions of many species have already shifted due to changing climatic conditions. Given that most terrestrial venomous species are ectotherms closely tied to ambient temperature, and that climate change is shifting temperature zones away from the equator, further significant distribution and population changes should be anticipated. For those species able to migrate to match the changing temperatures, new geographical locations may open. For those species with limited distribution capabilities, the rate of climate change may accelerate faster than species can adapt, causing population declines. Specifically, poisonous snakes and spiders will likely maintain their population numbers but will shift their geographic distribution to traditionally temperate zones more often inhabited by humans. Fire ants and Africanized honey bees are expected to have an expanded range distribution due to predicted warming trends. Human encounters with these types of creatures are likely to increase, resulting in potential human morbidity and mortality.

"24",115,"Climate change and <i>Ixodes</i> tick-borne diseases of humans","Ostfeld, R. S.; Brunner, J. L.","The evidence that climate warming is changing the distribution of Ixodes ticks and the pathogens they transmit is reviewed and evaluated. The primary approaches are either phenomenological, which typically assume that climate alone limits current and future distributions, or mechanistic, asking which tick-demographic parameters are affected by specific abiotic conditions. Both approaches have promise but are severely limited when applied separately. For instance, phenomenological approaches (e.g. climate envelope models) often select abiotic variables arbitrarily and produce results that can be hard to interpret biologically. On the other hand, although laboratory studies demonstrate strict temperature and humidity thresholds for tick survival, these limits rarely apply to field situations. Similarly, no studies address the influence of abiotic conditions on more than a few life stages, transitions or demographic processes, preventing comprehensive assessments. Nevertheless, despite their divergent approaches, both mechanistic and phenomenological models suggest dramatic range expansions of Ixodes ticks and tick-borne disease as the climate warms. The predicted distributions, however, vary strongly with the models' assumptions, which are rarely tested against reasonable alternatives. These inconsistencies, limited data about key tick-demographic and climatic processes and only limited incorporation of non-climatic processes have weakened the application of this rich area of research to public health policy or actions. We urge further investigation of the influence of climate on vertebrate hosts and tick-borne pathogen dynamics. In addition, testing model assumptions and mechanisms in a range of natural contexts and comparing their relative importance as competing models in a rigorous statistical framework will significantly advance our understanding of how climate change will alter the distribution, dynamics and risk of tick-borne disease.",2015,"APR 5","PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","370","1665","","WOS:000350829800011","10.1098/rstb.2014.0051","","#9153","Ostfeld 2015","","Biotic; Perspective paper; Potentially relevant; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

A.","Nesting populations of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the Atlantic and western Indian Oceans are increasing or stable while those in the Pacific are declining. It has been suggested that leatherbacks in the eastern Pacific may be resource limited due to environmental variability derived from the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), but this has yet to be tested. Here we explored bottom-up forcing and the responding reproductive output of nesting leatherbacks worldwide. We achieved this through an extensive review of leatherback nesting and migration data and by analyzing the spatial, temporal, and quantitative nature of resources as indicated by net primary production at post-nesting female migration and foraging areas. Leatherbacks in the eastern Pacific were the smallest in body size and had the lowest reproductive output due to less productive and inconsistent resources within their migration and foraging areas. This derived from natural interannual and multidecadal climate variability together with an influence of anthropogenic climate warming that is possibly affecting these natural cycles. The reproductive output of leatherbacks in the Atlantic and western Indian Oceans was nearly twice that of turtles in the eastern Pacific. The inconsistent nature of the Pacific Ocean may also render western Pacific leatherbacks susceptible to a more variable reproductive output; however, it appears that egg harvesting on nesting beaches is their major threat.

"27",151,"Climate change and impacts of boreal forest insects","Volney, W. J. A.; Fleming, R. A.","The circum-polar boreal forest has played an important role in the wealth of northern nations since the 15th century. Its natural resources spurred strategic geopolitical developments beginning in the 16th century but intense development of the boreal forest is largely limited to the 20th century. Insects cause considerable loss of wood that has an adverse effect on the balance of carbon sequestered by forests. Current understanding of processes that lead to stand-replacing outbreaks in three insect species is reviewed in this paper. Many of these processes depend on climate either directly, such as reduced survival with extreme weather events, or indirectly, mainly through effects on the host trees. In the boreal zone of Canada, pest-caused timber losses may be as much as 1.3-2.0 times the mean annual depletions due to fires. Pests are thus major, but consistently overlooked forest ecosystem components that have manifold consequences to the structure and functions of future forests. Global change will have demonstrable changes in the frequency and intensity of pest outbreaks, particularly at the margins of host ranges. The consequent shunting of carbon back to the atmosphere rather than to sequestration in forests as biomass is thought to have positive feedback to global warming. Whereas significant progress has been made in developing carbon budget models for the boreal forests of Canada, enormous problems remain in incorporating pest effects in these models. These problems have their origins in the nature of interactions among pests with forest productivity, and problems with scaling. The common problems of verification and validation of model results are particularly troublesome in projecting future forest productivity. The interaction of insects with fires must be accounted for if realistic carbon sequestration forecasts in a warming climate are to be made, These problems make assessments of mitigation and adaptation of pest management alternatives difficult to evaluate at present. Nevertheless, the impacts of stand-replacing insect population outbreaks is important in formulating future resource management policy. Crown Copyright (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Additional cases of faunal losses have been noted from Asia, North America, the Arctic, the Neotropics, and elsewhere. While this review addresses both species loss and population declines, its emphasis is on the latter. Declines of abundant species can be especially worrisome, given that they anchor trophic interactions and shoulder many of the essential ecosystem services of their respective communities. A review of the factors believed to be responsible for observed collapses and those perceived to be especially threatening to insects form the core of this treatment. In addition to widely recognized threats to insect biodiversity, e.g., habitat destruction, agricultural intensification (including pesticide use), climate change, and invasive species, this assessment highlights a few less commonly considered factors such as atmospheric nitrification from the burning of fossil fuels and the effects of droughts and changing precipitation patterns. Because the geographic extent and magnitude of insect declines are largely unknown, there is an urgent need for monitoring efforts, especially across ecological gradients, which will help to identify important causal factors in declines.

Canada yew has a relatively unique growth form, with low sprawling branches capable of forming dense clusters of stems. Historic accounts suggest that before Euro-American settlement, Canada yew was a common plant across its range in many forest types and that it was locally abundant or dominant in 5%-20% of forest stands in the northern part of its range. Canada yew's range has declined during the last century as a result of browsing by native ungulates, fire, intensive forest management, and clearing of land for agriculture and other development. It is considered uncommon throughout most of its present North American range, except for often isolated populations in areas that remain free from heavy browsing pressure by moose and deer (e.g., islands, areas with heavy snow cover, or areas naturally low in ungulate abundance). Its decline has likely resulted in changes to abiotic and biotic conditions, including structure and composition of understory vegetation and concomitant effects on understory vertebrates.

This mosquito, similar to other Stegomyia species such as Aedes aegypti (L.), is highly adapted to urban and suburban areas, and commonly oviposits in artificial containers, which are ubiquitous in these peridomestic environments. The increase in speed and amount of international travel and commerce, coupled with global climate change, have aided in the resurgence and expansion of Stegomyia species into new areas of North America. In many parts of their range, both species are implicated as significant vectors of emerging and re-emerging arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and now Zika. Although rapid and major advances have been made in the field of biology, ecology, genetics, taxonomy, and virology, relatively little has changed in the field of mosquito control in recent decades. This is particularly discouraging in regards to container-inhabiting mosquitoes, because traditional integrated mosquito management (IMM) approaches have not been effective against these species. Many mosquito control programs simply do not possess the man-power or necessary financial resources needed to suppress Ae. albopictus effectively. Therefore, control of mosquito larvae, which is the foundation of IMM approaches, is exceptionally difficult over large areas. This review paper addresses larval habitats, use of geographic information systems for habitat preference detection, door-to-door control efforts, source reduction, direct application of larvicides, biological control agents, area-wide low-volume application of larvicides, hot spot treatments, autodissemination stations, public education, adult traps, attractive-toxic sugar bait methods, lethal ovitraps, barrier-residual adulticides, hand-held ultra-low-volume adulticides, area-wide adulticides applied by ground or air, and genetic control methods. The review concludes with future recommendations for practitioners, researchers, private industry, and policy makers.

We present a conceptual framework using one system as a model, emphasizing interactions across levels of biological hierarchy and spatiotemporal scales. Bark beetles are major natural disturbance agents in western North American forests. However, recent bark beetle population eruptions have exceeded the frequencies, impacts, and ranges documented during the previous 125 years. Extensive host abundance and susceptibility, concentrated beetle density, favorable weather, optimal symbiotic associations, and escape from natural enemies must occur jointly for beetles to surpass a series of thresholds and exert widespread disturbance. Opposing feedbacks determine qualitatively distinct outcomes at junctures at the biochemical through landscape levels. Eruptions occur when key thresholds are surpassed, prior constraints cease to exert influence, and positive feedbacks amplify across scales. These dynamics are bidirectional, as landscape features influence how lower-scale processes are amplified or buffered. Climate change and reduced habitat heterogeneity increase the likelihood that key thresholds will be exceeded, and may cause fundamental regime shifts. Systems in which endogenous feedbacks can dominate after external forces foster the initial breach of thresholds appear particularly sensitive to anthropogenic perturbations.",2008,"/","BioScience.","","","501-517","","10.1641/B580607","IND44071925","#15461","Raffa 2008","Anabel Kinsey (2024-09-04 09:19:50)(Select): I couldn't find a specific temporal example of a flow, but I think this has a lot of potential!

We analyzed the effects of temperature anomaly on arrival date and infestation severity of potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae Harris, a classic new world long distance migrant, and a significant pest in several agricultural crops. We compiled E. fabae arrival dates and infestation severity data at different states in USA from existing literature reviews and agricultural extension records from 1951-2012, and examined the influence of temperature anomalies at each target state or overwintering range on the date of arrival and severity of infestation. Average E. fabae arrival date at different states reveal a clear trend along the south-north axis, with earliest arrival closest to the overwintering range. E. fabae arrival has advanced by 10 days over the last 62 years. E. fabae arrived earlier in warmer years in relation to each target state level temperature anomaly (3.0 days/ degrees C increase in temperature anomaly). Increased temperature had a significant and positive effect on the severity of infestation, and arrival date had a marginal negative effect on severity.

Many of these diseases are no longer present, mainly because of changes in land use, agricultural methods, residential patterns, human behaviour, and vector control. However, diseases that may be transmitted to humans from wild birds or mammals (zoonoses; e.g. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and leptospirosis) continue to circulate in nature in many parts of the country. Most vector-borne diseases exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, which clearly suggests that they are weather sensitive. Rainfall, temperature, and other weather variables affect in many ways both the vectors and the pathogens they transmit. For example, high temperatures can increase or reduce survival rate, depending on the vector, its behaviour, ecology, and many other factors. Thus, the probability of transmission may or may not be increased by higher temperatures. The tremendous growth in international travel increases the risk of importation of vector-borne diseases, some of which can be transmitted locally under suitable circumstances at the right time of the year.

Presently, Arctic fulmars face threats from harvest, bycatch in fisheries, and fouling in oil spills while the birds are in their winter range (the North Atlantic). However, during breeding, migration, and overwintering, they may also experience stress from ecotourism, contaminants, particulate garbage, and climate change.

The Arctic and Antarctic regions are extremely sensitive to climate change and have displayed profound and variable changes over recent decades, including decreases in sea ice extent, greening of tundra, and changes to hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. It is unclear how polar-adapted arthropods will respond to such changes, though many are expected to be at great risk of extinction. Here, we review the adaptive mechanisms that allow polar arthropods to persist in extreme environments and discuss how the effects of climate change at the poles will likely favour non-native species or those with the ability to rapidly evolve and/or acclimate. We find that physiological, behavioural, plastic, and genetic data are limited in scope for polar arthropods and research on adaptive responses to change is scarce. This restricts our ability to predict how they may respond to a warming climate.

A key question is how these changes will alter the provision of ecosystem services from the ocean, particularly from fisheries. To answer this question, we need to understand not only the ecological dynamics of marine systems, but also human adaptation and feedbacks between humans and the rest of the natural world. In this review, we outline what we have learned from research primarily in continental shelf ecosystems and fishing communities of North America. Key findings are that marine animals are highly sensitive to warming and are responding quickly to changes in water temperature, and that such changes are often happening faster than similar processes on land. Changes in species distributions and productivity are having substantial impacts on fisheries, including through changing catch compositions and longer distances traveled for fishing trips. Conflicts over access to fisheries have also emerged as species distributions are no longer aligned with regulations or catch allocations. These changes in the coupled natural-human system have reduced the value of ecosystem services from some fisheries and risk doing so even more in the future. Going forward, substantial opportunities for more effective fisheries management and operations, marine conservation, and marine spatial planning are likely possible through greater consideration of climate information over time-scales from years to decades.",2020,"","Special Feature: Marine ecosystem services: Ecological, socioeconomic and cultural sustainability.","63","1","17-26","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1438-390X.12050","","#22124","Pinsky 2020","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

"42",238,"Forest ecosystems of temperate climatic regions: from ancient use to climate change","Gilliam, Frank S"," 871I.I. IntroductionForest ecosystems have always been an integral part of human existence, whether as a source of food, fiber, and habitat, as an essential component in maintaining the atmospheric balance of O2 and CO2, or as a source of musical, artistic, or poetic inspiration.Gilliam I chose to begin my book on the ecology of herbaceous communities of forests of eastern North America with this statement for both personal and professional reasons. I suspect that many, if not most, people who have had direct contact with forests eventually grow to establish an intimate connection with them, and at a variety of levels. It was such a personal intimacy that led to my scientific study of them. As this is a Tansley review, it is an appropriate aside to note that Sir Arthur Tansley himself conveyed a special sense of awe regarding forests, more specifically the Kingley Vale in his native England (Fig. ), which offered a view that Tansley considered 'the finest in England,' a place that held both spiritual and professional significance for him, first as an 11-yr-old boy and later as an international leader in the field of plant ecology (Ayres, ).Although humans have long utilized resources associated with all forest biomes - tropical, subtropical, temperate and boreal - I suggest that it is the expanse of human populations in the temperate region that has left the most indelible anthropogenic signature among forested regions. Certainly, deforestation in the tropics has been, and continues to be, a serious environmental concern, for example, with projected loss of forest cover being up to 40% for the Amazon Basin by 2050 (Soares-Fihlo et al., ), and a global annual loss rate of 0.4% (Hansen et al., ; Malhi et al., ). However, a far greater relative fraction of the original extent of temperate forests of the eastern United States has at one time been harvested, with estimates of < 1% of these original forests remaining as primary (old-growth) forests (Davis, ). Older examples of anthropogenic alteration are wide-spread in Central Europe, where forest conversion dates back to the Neolithic Period (EEA, ). Dambrine et al.  found evidence for 2000-yr-old ecological legacies created by temperate forest conversion and subsequent agricultural practices by the Romans in central France. Older still is the human imprint left on temperate forests of China, wherein extensive forest alteration dates back some 6000 yr before present (BP), to such an extent that the roles of climate and anthropogenic disturbance are essentially confounded in understanding long-term patterns of change in vegetation (Liu, ). Thus, if there is a common theme across the global distribution of temperate forests, it is that the human imprint on them is indelibly large and deep, and more so than with any other forest biome type.The term 'global change' is a collective term to describe anthropogenic modification of all aspects of the global environment that has the potential to alter the sustainability of the Earth for life. Often erroneously used interchangeably with anthropogenic climate change (hereafter, simply 'climate change'), global change comprises not only climate change, but also other essential facets of environmental change that interact with climate change, including land use, modification of local and regional hydrological cycles, changes in biogeochemical cycles, and biodiversity loss (Vitousek, ; Steffen et al., ; Franklin et al., ). Clearly, global change is not only quite evident in all temperate forests of the world, but also it has long been so.Indeed, there is an ancient legacy of human alteration of landscapes of temperate forests on a global scale. In North America, notable evidence suggests that, far before the arrival of Europeans, use of fire by Native American peoples greatly impacted the composition of eastern hardwood forests, especially regarding tree species of masting or fruiting value, either directly for food or indirectly for game forage (Kay & Simmons, ). Even the English landscape that was so dear to Tansley (e.g. the Kingley Vale panorama; Fig. ) was anything but pristine wilderness, given widespread deforestation of the English landscape by Romans 2000 yr BP (Williams, ). These observations challenge the very notion of what truly constitutes a primary or pristine state. Further, global change should never be considered a solely recent, modern phenomenon.New terminology has recently been developed to address this awareness. Ellis et al.  quantified anthropogenic change of global biomes (anthromes). Even our current epoch - the Holocene - is increasingly being referred to as the Anthropocene considering wide temporal and spatial scales of human alteration of all facets of the biosphere, from domestication of animal species and conversion of vast areas of land for cultivation, to long-term changes in atmospheric chemistry (Steffen et al., ; Ellis, ; Lewis & Maslin, ).Ellis  conceptualized how humans, more than any other multicellular organism, have transformed Earth's ecosystems, including temperate forests, leading to what he calls anthroecology theory. Figure  provides a visual representation of this theory for a temperate woodland. Beginning with earliest human inhabitation of the Earth, human populations have not only expanded in number, but have also changed socio-culturally, from hunter-gatherer, to horticultural, eventually to our current industrial status. The result has been chronic anthropogenic change in land use and cover, patterns of energy consumption, ecosystem properties (e.g. carbon flux and nutrient cycling) and ecosystem state (from 'wild' to 'novel' to 'used') (Fig. ). This provides a conceptual framework for this review, as it links ancient use of temperate forests to current patterns of climate change.The purpose of this review is to bring into focus the diverse forests of the temperate region of the biosphere, with particular emphasis on crucial challenges for the future of temperate forests. Although these are generally found between 20° and 60° in each of the north and south latitudes, because land mass distribution of the biosphere is decidedly asymmetrical (more land occurring north of the equator) and due to a variety of climatic, oceanographic, and orographic factors, temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere lack the widespread nature of their northern counterparts. Consequently, somewhat more emphasis will be placed on temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere.871II.II. A brief biogeography and history of temperate forestsIn North America, temperate forests span most of the eastern United States as hardwoods of widely varying species dominance, with conifer and mixed (conifer/hardwood) forests occurring in parts of the southeast, west and, especially, the Pacific Northwest, from the coastal United States into Canada. Temperate forests dominate essentially all of England and northern Europe, with a narrow band reaching far into Russia, much of eastern China and virtually all of Japan (Fig. ). Distributions of temperate forests are more restricted in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere, including southern Chile, southeastern Australia and all of Tasmania, and parts of New Zealand, including all of the North Island, where it is referred to as oceanic temperate forest (McGlone et al., ). Temperate conifers tend to dominate in more extreme conditions (e.g. cold climates and/or infertile soils) (Reich & Frelich, ; Waring, ), or in fire-dominated regions (e.g. the southeastern Coastal Plain and western regions of the USA), although conifer dominance in other regions (e.g. North American Pacific Northwest) has been ascribed to unusually long photosynthetic seasons arising from mild winters with abundant rainfall (Givnish, ) (Fig. ).The predominant climate of most of these forest regions is one of distinct cyclic, seasonal changes involving periods of growth and dormancy. Specific temporal patterns of seasonal change, however, display impressive variability among temperate forest regions, a function of latitude (longer growing seasons toward at lower latitudes), topographic features (e.g. mountains) and proximity to oceans with marine currents of varying prevailing temperatures. The latter is evidenced by the development of temperate rainforests associated with coastal main lands or islands, including the Pacific coast of North America and small areas of Great Britain and Japan, and throughout most of southern Chile, southeastern Australia and southern New Zealand (Alaback, ).Geological history and soil formation also vary greatly among temperate forests, thus precluding broad generalizations (Bally & Palmer, ; Ponge et al., ). In North America the geological (continental) structure is generally symmetrical, beginning with the middle outward including shield, interior lowlands, mountains, coastal plains, continental shelves and ocean basins. By contrast, Eurasia lacks such symmetry, with Europe being geologically separated from Asia by the Ural Mountains (King, ). Thus, the broad spatial patterns of soil formation in North America contrast sharply with those for Asia (Bally & Palmer, ; Ponge et al., ; King, ).One aspect of geological history shared among temperate forests is the profound effects of glaciation (Clark et al., ). Most relevant is the occurrence of the last glacial maximum (LGM), a period of widespread surface ice that ended c. 20 000 yr bp (Yokoyama et al., ). Given the extent of LGM glaciers (Fig. a,b), any exposition of temperate forests necessitates at least a perfunctory understanding of their widespread nature. Glaciations of the LGM even have a diverse nomenclature, based on global location (Ehlers & Gibbard, ). Prominent in the Northern Hemisphere were the Wisconsin glaciation in North America and the Devensian,Wurm and Weichselian glaciations in the British Isles, Alps and Northern/Central Europe, respectively. In the Southern Hemisphere, LGM glaciers include the Llanquihue and Otira glaciations in Chile and New Zealand, respectively.Despite their widespread occurrence, temperate forests of many regions are similar in development toward their present state. Most of the Northern Hemisphere was once dominated by the Arcto-Tertiary geoflora (Cain, ; Axelrod, ; Whittaker, ). This was a time (c. 15 Myr BP) of a far warmer global climate than the present one, which was especially pronounced toward polar areas. Within this expansive forest were numerous gymnosperm genera, such as Cedrus,Picea,Pinus and Tsuga, and angiosperm genera - Acer,Betula,Carya,Corylus,Castanea,Fagus,Magnolia,Quercus,Tilia,Ulmus and Liquidambar (Xiang et al., ; Graham, ). Increased warming during the Tertiary yielded to the cooler Quaternary, leading to the massive glaciers of the LGM over much of what is now boreal forest throughout the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. a). This pushed many species south toward the unglaciated refugia (e.g. Appalachian Mountains), which may have provided sources of remigration of species toward their current distributions (Davis, ; Graham, ; Stebich et al., ).Interestingly, the LGM is essentially irrelevant for temperate forests of China, largely unaffected by Quaternary glaciation (Liu, ). Pollen records reveal a diverse assemblage of tree genera at this time, varying from mixed conifer-hardwood to deciduous to widespread subtropical broadleaved evergreen forests; hardwoods comprised genera similar to other temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere, with a diverse oak (Quercus) flora (Liu, ). Stratigraphy of mid-Holocene pollen demonstrates a period of maximum warmth (i.e. the Hypsithermal). Throughout northern regions at this time, forests increased in diversity with thermophilous hardwoods expanding, replacing both pine and, toward the south, birch (Liu, ).Although glaciation also occurred in the Southern Hemisphere, other processes were equally significant in determining its temperate forest tree flora, including higher sea-to-land ratios creating conditions leading to temperate rain forests on west-facing coasts (Alaback, ) and species of Nothofagus and conifers of the families Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae (Beard, ; Kershaw & Wagstaff, ). During the Tertiary Period, drying occurred in continental regions, selecting more xeromorphic and even pyrophilic, fire-tolerant genera, such as Eucalyptus (Beard, ).Fire - typically more prevalent among conifer-dominated stands than hardwood-dominated stands - has long been an integral factor in directing the development of temperate forest ecosystems. Marlon et al.  used the paleorecord to examine the relationship between abrupt changes in global climate and enhanced frequency of fire. Using data from 35 charcoal/pollen records in North America to assess change in fire regimes during the past 15-10 kyr (the latest glacial-interglacial transition, and a time of profound climate change), they found clear links between fire frequency and degree of climate change. Implicit in their evidence is the intimate connection between occurrence of fire and the development of drought conditions in forested regions.874III.III. Climate, soils, composition and land use1. North AmericaTemperate forests of North America occur in the eastern United States primarily as hardwood forests (except for extreme high elevations and southeastern Coastal Plain pinelands) and as conifer and mixed forests in parts of the western United States and Canada. Using the Köppen-Geiger climate classification (Kottek et al., ), the predominant eastern climate would be classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) to the south, and humid continental (Dfa) to the north; prevailing climates for western forests are predominantly warm temperate (Csb), with boreal zone-like conditions (Dfc) at high elevations of central western USA. Winter climate is dominated by fluctuations between cold, dry arctic air, along with cyclonic storms with marine-derived moisture to produce occasional heavy snows. Winter temperatures vary from means of -5°C in the north to 10°C toward the south. Spring brings thunderstorm activity through mixing of cold polar air with moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. Mean summer temperatures throughout the region range from 20° to 27°C. Frost-free periods are generally between 120 and 150 d in the north to > 250 d in the south. Mean annual precipitation is 80-140 cm (Archibold, ). The prevailing climate of the Pacific Northwest forests is largely maritime, varying with latitude and elevation, with precipitation increasing with elevation (Franklin & Halpern, ).Soils of eastern forests are generally Alfisols, Inceptisols and Ultisols, glaciated towards the north (Fig. a). Unglaciated soils are old, with soil pH decreasing with age. Soils of western forests are spatially variable. Montane conifer forest soils are usually young, derived from granites, gneisses and schists (Peet, ). Pacific Northwest conifer forest soils comprise Ultisols, Inceptisols and Spodosols, with many soils of volcanic origin (Franklin & Halpern, ).With the exception of the virtual elimination of the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) by the chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) beginning in 1904, current eastern temperate forest types are largely similar to those originally described by Braun . With the highest tree diversity occurring in the mixed mesophytic forest region of the Appalachians, dominant genera include oaks (Quercus spp.), maples (Acer spp.), hickories (Carya spp.) and birch (Betula spp.), along with American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera).Conifer forests vary greatly within the broad temperate region of North America. At the higher elevations throughout the Appalachian mountain range (800-1200 m above sea level (asl) in New England to 1600 m asl in the Great Smoky Mountains), spruce (Abies spp.) and fir (Picea spp.) forests are common (Vankat, ). Southeastern Coastal Plain conifer forests are predominantly pines (Pinus spp.) of a primarily successional nature, the result of frequent natural (e.g. fire) and anthropogenic (e.g. harvesting) disturbances (Platt et al., ); these typically change through secondary succession to Quercus-Carya forests (Peet et al., ). Before European settlement c. 250 yr bp, this region was dominated by a single species - Pinus palustris - which is currently < 3% of its original distribution (Gilliam & Platt, ).Montane conifer forests of western North America contain more genera than those of the eastern United States. Important genera include fir (Abies spp.), juniper (Juniperus spp.), spruce (Picea spp.), pine (Pinus spp.), hemlock (Tsuga spp.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Some of these form mixed forests, especially those associated with elevation gradients and successional status following disturbances, such as fire; hardwoods include maple (Acer spp.), alder (Alnus spp.), poplar (Populus spp.) and mountain ash (Sorbus spp.) (Peet, ). The mild, moist climate of Pacific Northwest (coastal forests west of the Cascade crest) selects for a complex assortment of conifer species, including Pseudotsuga menziesii,Tsuga spp., Abies spp., Pinus spp. and several genera of cedars (family Cupressaceae, e.g. Calocedrus,Chamaecyparis,Thuja), including the awe-inspiring redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), the tallest tree in the world (Franklin & Halpern, ).2. EuropeThe European Environment Agency divides Europe into 11 biogeographical regions, based on prevailing climate and proximity to bodies of water (EEA, ). Regions most germane to this discussion are the Atlantic, Black Sea, Continental and Pannonian, with Continental occupying by far the largest area (Finnie et al., ). Temperate forests here are predominantly hardwood species, with conifer forests increasing in importance toward the north and with increasing elevation. These extend farther east into western Russia, wherein climate becomes increasingly continental and drier, contrasting with the maritime climate toward the west. The climate throughout this area ranges from temperate oceanic (Do) in the west to temperate continental (Dc) eastward (Kottek et al., ). Winter temperatures vary from maritime means of 3° to 5°C to continental means of -4° to -15°C in central Russia. Mean summer temperatures generally range from 22° to 30°C. Mean annual precipitation is 50-75 cm, with snow uncommon in lowland parts of Europe (Archibold, ).Many of the soils of Europe often are referred to collectively as brown earths, which are similar to North American Alfisols, except that many are developed from calcareous parent materials wherein they are more similar to Inceptisols. Other common soils are Spodosols, especially in northern latitudes (Jones et al., ).Human alteration of temperate forests over recent millennia is perhaps most pronounced here (Mitchell & Cole, ; Niklasson et al., ), where only c. 25% of forests are considered primary (sensu FAO, : 'forest of native species where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes have not been significantly disturbed'), something that disconnects forest distribution with climate (Allen et al., ). Evidence suggests that anthropogenic disturbance began there in the Neolithic, with widespread forest conversion beginning c. 7000 yr BP (EEA, ). Since these ancient times, forest condition has been closely linked with human populations and socio-economic development. Both historical and paleo-ecological records indicate periods not only of increased logging, but also of land abandonment and forest regrowth, including the plague years of the 1300s (EEA, ).There are generally fewer tree species in Europe than in North America, a contrast further exacerbated by extensive planting of conifer species throughout hardwood ranges (Augusto et al., ). Despite this, the two regions share many deciduous genera, including Quercus,Acer,Betula,Ulmus and Fagus (Pages & Michalet, ; Ellenberg, ). EEA  recognizes a mesophytic deciduous forest type, quite analogous to that which dominates the eastern United States. Analogous to chestnut blight in eastern USA, European species of Ulmus, especially white elm (U. laevis), have been decimated by the Dutch elm disease (Ophiostoma ulmi), which has also decimated elm species of North America (Peterken, ).The current extent of European temperate conifer forests is greatly modified by past and current policies to plant vast areas of productive conifer species. Again, widespread native deciduous forests have been replaced by conifer plantations, modifying the general composition of the western European temperate forest. Although some of these were transplanted from within Europe (e.g. Norway spruce, Picea abies and Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris), others were imported from North America (e.g. Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis and Douglas fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii) (Augusto et al., ). Not surprisingly, then, as with hardwood genera, predominant European conifer genera overlap greatly with those of North America, including Abies,Picea and Pinus (EEA, ).3. AsiaSimilar to their North American counterparts, temperate forests of Asia occur primarily as hardwood forests throughout the eastern part of the continent, extending to and including virtually the entire island of Japan, except for extremes of elevation and north latitude, where there are well-developed boreal conifer forests (Aiba, ), resulting from similar climates between the two regions, primarily humid subtropical and temperate continental, Cf and Dc, respectively (Kottek et al., ). The most profound difference in climate between these regions is the existence of a monsoon season widespread in parts of Asia, arising from drastic pressure changes over the continent, that is, Monsoon Asia (Nakashizuka & Iida, ). Consequently, precipitation in Monsoon Asia has a pronounced summer maximum, with up to 90% falling between May and September. The wettest areas are on the Korean peninsula. Mean winter temperatures range from c. 3°C to -15°C in southern coastal and northern interior regions, respectively. Spring is dominated by moist tropical maritime air, with July temperatures averaging from 22°C to 28°C (Archibold, ).Soils of Asian temperate forests are analogous to those of North American temperate forests. These vary from Alfisols in upland regions to Ultisols toward the south and east, with Entisols forming from alluvium along rivers. Spodosols develop in conifer-dominated regions associated with higher elevation and more northern latitudes (Archibold, ).Although the temperate deciduous forests of Asia are the most species-rich temperate forests in the world, many of them have been altered irreparably by land use, particularly in the lowland plains, which are virtually entirely cultivated (An et al., ). Many Asian tree taxa are quite common in North America (Ying, ; Nakashizuka & Iida, ; Fang et al., ), including Quercus,Ulmus,Tilia,Fraxinus,Acer and Lindera (Henbo et al., ; Takahashi, ), and close relatives such as Asian Castanopsis and Distylium (Miura et al., ). Species vary greatly with elevation (Sang & Bai, ), with upland areas supporting species of Betula,Populus,Acer and Tilia;Salix,Betula and Populus are common in riparian areas (An et al., ). Forest type varies greatly with latitude; from north to south, this grades from mixed conifer to deciduous to mixed deciduous, then to widely distributed subtropical broadleaved evergreen forests (Liu, ).Asian conifers increase in importance with increasing elevation. Working in Chinese subalpine forests, Taylor et al.  reported extensive stands as mosaics of conifer (Abies,Larix,Sabina and Tsuga) and hardwood (Betula) patches. Other conifer genera include Picea and Pinus (Miyajima & Takahashi, ).4. Southern HemisphereBecause the distribution of land mass of the biosphere is decidedly asymmetrical, with far more land area being distributed north of the equator, temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere lack the expansiveness so characteristic of the Northern Hemisphere. These forests are confined to relatively narrow bands along western South America, southeastern Australia (including all of Tasmania) and northern New Zealand, including the northwestern half of South Island. Climatic, oceanographic and orographic factors further limit forest development in many areas of the Southern Hemisphere. These regions display very high ocean:land mass ratios; consequently, they are generally of maritime temperate climates (Cf). The Andes range exerts a profound influence on the prevailing climate of temperate-forest South America, with the windward side receiving a relatively constant flow of maritime air from the Pacific Ocean (Perakis & Hedin, ), and many are temperate rain forests (Beard, ). Mean annual temperatures are generally 6-10°C, with a range typically < 10°C. In coastal areas, July-to-January temperatures vary only by 4° or 5°C, with a similar pattern found for coastal southwestern New Zealand. Indeed, summers average c. 20°C, with winters ranging from 10-15°C. Precipitation for most of these sites is very high, exceeding 300 cm, reaching as much as 850 cm (Sturman & Tapper, ).Many of the soils throughout the temperate Southern Hemisphere are highly weathered Spodosols, the result of high amounts of rainfall and its associated fluctuating water table. These soils are generally highly acidic and infertile (Veblen et al., ; Grubb et al., ).Forest genera, and even plant families, of the temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere are quite dissimilar to those of the Northern Hemisphere. Prominent genera are Nothofagus (Nothofagaceae) and Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae), neither part of the native flora in the Northern Hemisphere. Conifer genera are in Araucariaceae (e.g. Araucaria) and Podocarpaceae (e.g. Podocarpus,Dacrydium) (Beard, ; Kershaw & Wagstaff, ). Forests of Chile and Argentina vary sensitively along the Andes-induced climatic gradient. Nothofagus species are dominant throughout these forests (Veblen et al., ; Armesto et al., ), but with Araucaria araucana replacing Nothofagus species under more stressful environmental conditions (Sanguinetti & Kitzberger, ). Mainland forests of Australia are dominated by Eucalyptus and Acacia species, especially in drier areas, whereas Nothofagus species, along with gymnosperms, are found in the cool, moist forests of Tasmania. Nothofagus is common in New Zealand, covering 84% and 40% of the South and North Islands, respectively (Beard, ). The current status of many forests of the Southern Hemisphere represents considerably altered states of the primary conditions, for example, the rainforests of Chile before the Conquest of Chile in the mid-16th Century by Spain (Smith-Ramírez, ).875IV.IV. Climate changeHumans have, indeed, long utilized temperate forests for a variety of purposes (Fig. ). Currently, temperate forests are managed worldwide for timber production, driven by an ever-increasing demand and resulting from relatively rapid growth among overstory dominant species, but also from the versatility of temperate tree species for numerous uses (e.g. paper, construction materials, furniture). Management practices potentially affect these forests across all spatial scales, from the landscape (Rhemtulla et al., ), to the overstory (Beaudet et al., ), and, often most sensitive, the herb layer (Moola & Vasseur, ; von Oheimb & Härdtle, ; Gilliam, ; Hedwall & Brunet, ). Furthermore, management practices historically often have been carried out using methods that are unsustainable in terms of maintaining forest ecosystem structure and function, including plantation forestry, especially conversion from slower-growing hardwood forests to faster-growing conifer plantations (Seidl et al., ), and forest fragmentation (Smith-Ramírez, ). Naudts et al.  suggested that broadscale conversion of temperate European hardwoods to conifer plantations contributes measurably to what is perhaps the most profound modern human influence on these forests - climate change (Lindner et al., ; Parks & Bernier, ).Thus, I suggest the following as the 'bookends' of anthropogenic impacts on temperate forests. The first is their historic - even ancient - and chronic use/conversion by ever-increasing human populations; the second is climate change. The spatial and temporal dimensions of these are superimposed (Fig. ). The legacy effects of the recent and distant past are currently on a trajectory of future dynamics operating under the overriding influence of climate change (Dale et al., ), and all that is associated with it, including altered phenology of organisms (Parmesan & Yohe, ) and extremes of weather-related phenomena (Min et al., ) (Fig. ). All responses of temperate forests to current land-use pressures must be viewed forever through the lens of climate change (Fig. ).In this final section, I emphasize challenges for future sustainability of global temperate forests. This is not meant to represent an exhaustive list of all critical issues. Rather, I emphasize those for which sufficient work has been done to provide an understanding of the nature of the problem. These include the effects of atmospheric deposition of excess N, global change-mediated alterations in phenology of temperate forest species and increases in drought/fire.1. Excess nitrogenMore pronounced in the Northern than the Southern Hemisphere, a major human perturbation of temperate forests worldwide has arisen from emissions of reactive nitrogen (Nr) into the atmosphere leading to chronically elevated deposition of Nr and a cascade of environmental stresses for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and human health (Galloway et al., ). The N comprising 78% of the atmosphere - N2 - is considered nonreactive N because it enters into essentially no photochemical transformations in the atmosphere and no metabolic pathways in organisms, other than N fixation by a small group of symbiotic and nonsymbiotic prokaryotes. However, numerous forms of Nr exist, including NH3, NH4+, NO, NO2, NO3-, 2N2O5, HNO3 and several forms of peroxyacetyl nitrates (Horii et al., ), all capable of undergoing photochemical transformations in the atmosphere and entering terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.Although more research on the effects of excess N has focused on herb-dominated than on forested ecosystems (Clark et al., ; Simkin et al., ), increasingly work is being devoted to understanding such effects on forest ecosystems, including those of the temperate regions (Sutton et al., ). Whereas current increases in N deposition are occurring on a global scale (Bobbink et al., ), N-mediated threats to biodiversity are particularly pronounced for temperate forests, especially given the spatial coincidence of high human population density - and associated N pollution - with temperate forests (Holland & Lamarque, ), the disproportionate contribution of the herbaceous layer to temperate forest diversity (Gilliam, ), and the sensitivity of the forest herb community to excess N (Gilliam, ). More vexing still is that chronically elevated N deposition is occurring contemporaneously and, indeed, interactively with climate change (Maes et al., ).Essentially all initial work on effects of excess N deposition on terrestrial ecosystems examined biogeochemical responses. These studies focused on changes in stream chemistry, generally showing increases in NO3- (from enhanced nitrification and leaching) and base cations (Ca++, Mg++ and K+) coupled with the movement of NO3- (Aber, ). Many areas of temperate forests of North America, especially those of the eastern United States, were shown to be sensitive to N saturation, a phenomenon which develops as atmospheric and microbial supply of available N exceeds biotic demand. Recent work has emphasized the effects of excess N on biodiversity of temperate forests (Thomas et al., ; Clark et al., ; Simkin et al., ). Despite considerable inter-site variability, a broad consensus is that excess N decreases forest biodiversity in temperate forests of North America.Gilliam  provided a conceptual model to describe interactive processes that are sensitive to increased N loading in ways that can lead to loss of herb layer diversity, including altering interspecific competition, increasing herbivory and pathogenic fungal infection, inhibiting mycorrhizal associations and enhancing species invasions. Nitrogen-mediated declines in biodiversity are typically seen as loss of species in the herb layer from the increased cover of fewer nitrophilic species at the expense of numerous N-efficient species (Gilliam et al., ). Fewer studies have focused on responses of tree species to N. Thomas et al.  modelled the potential effects of N on temperate forest C sequestration and tree seedling survivorship. Chronically elevated N deposition enhanced C storage, but decreased survivorship in 8 of 11 common temperate tree species. Following N saturation, C sequestration is typically limited by another nutrient (Leuzinger & Hättenschwiler, ), often phosphorus (Gress et al., ).Research focusing on chronically elevated N deposition leading to N saturation began in Europe much earlier than in North America, primarily because N-related threats appeared earlier and were far more widespread there (Gilliam, ). Although a notable amount of European work has been in the boreal region and in herb-dominated ecosystems, most recent work has been carried out in temperate forested regions, with much of that concerned with the response of the typically species-rich herbaceous layer to excess N, largely based on broad regional synthesis studies (De Schrijver et al., ; Verheyen et al., ; Dirnböck et al., ; Ferretti et al., ).Borrowing a phrase from my home state of West Virginia, where coal mining is common, many N-effects studies in Europe use the forest herb layer community as 'the canary in a coal mine' (wherein caged canaries were once placed in a coal mine, whose death served as an early indication of impending peril for coal miners from coal gas). The wide spatial extent of sampling employed by these studies adds considerable validity and credibility to their findings. Verheyen et al.  compiled data from 1205 permanent/semi-permanent sample plots among 23 carefully selected understory resurvey studies. Utilizing a wide gradient in N deposition across deciduous temperate forests in Europe, they assessed the importance of factors influencing forest herb communities, including rate of N deposition, change in density of large herbivores, and change in forest canopy cover and composition. Their results demonstrated the interactive nature of these factors, concluding that N-mediated increases in nitrophilous species can be obscured by changes in the forest overstory. Similarly, Dirnböck et al.  synthesized long-term monitoring data from 1335 permanent samples among 28 forested sites from northern Fennoscandia to southern Italy, noting temporal trends in herb-layer species cover and diversity. They found a pattern of gradual replacement of N-efficient species by nitrophilous species in response to N deposition that was consistent on the European scale. Hedwall & Brunet  attempted to separate effects of global change and altered land-use in both boreal and temperate forests of Sweden by documenting temporal variation in herb layer species over a 20-yr period in both boreal and temperate forests of Sweden, finding that most species changed in overall frequency. Comparing functional traits of both increasing and declining species, they found that current floristic dynamics were caused by combined effects of climate warming, nitrogen deposition and changing land-use (e.g. plantation forestry). Herb species' changes were more pronounced in temperate, rather than boreal, forests.Less is known regarding the effects of excess N on temperate forests of Asia (Liu et al., ) and the Southern Hemisphere. In China, this arises because of the chronically highly dissected extent of temperate forests (Liu, ) and the spatial distribution of highest amounts of N deposition occurring in tropical/sub-tropical regions (Lu et al., ). In addition to elevated rates of N emissions to the atmosphere (Liu et al., ), much of China's problems with excess N is associated with over-use of N fertilizers for summer maize agriculture (Zhang et al., ). Kim et al.  concluded that increases in N availability throughout Korea and Japan was most likely due to deposition of pollutant N from atmospheric sources from both industrial and agricultural regions. Perakis & Hedin  found that, as a result of their location relative to oceans, with prevailing winds coming off those oceans, forests of the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere receive some of the lowest annual rates of N deposition anywhere in the world (Godoy et al., ).2. Altered phenologyGiven that a prominent feature of all temperate forests is their distinct seasonality, phenology - seasonally recurring events of an organism's life cycle, for example, flowering, emergence of invertebrates, movement of migratory animals, and especially their timing and relationship with the physical environment - plays a key role in the structure and function of temperate forest ecosystems. For plants, phenological changes can be triggered by environmental cues, for example, chilling, spring temperature, growing degree days and daylight (Elmendorf et al., ). Because of their lack of thermoregulation, ectothermic animals (e.g. insects) can resemble plants with respect to environmental influences on and control of phenology, particularly temperature. Changes in phenology can affect several processes essential to survival, growth and reproduction of all organisms, especially critical when complex interspecific interactions are involved, such as plant-pollinator dynamics.Many plant species are classified phenologically, based on seasonal patterns of flowering via photoperiod. Long-day plants flower in spring as day length increases, whereas short-day plants flower from late summer into the fall as day length decreases. Actually, it is the length of uninterrupted darkness that controls flowering, such that long-day plants are more accurately short-night plants and vice versa. Despite this importance of photoperiod, thermoperiod - daily and seasonal patterns of change in temperature - also affects virtually all phenologically controlled plant processes. Anecdotally, gardeners rue days of atypically warm temperatures in late winter that allow flower and leaf buds to break dormancy, only to be followed by seasonal temperatures < 0°C that kill new, susceptible tissues.Evidence indicates that climate change has altered growing seasons in the temperate regions worldwide. Based on global meta-analyses of > 1700 wild species, including woody and herbaceous plants, birds, insects, amphibians and fish, Parmesan & Yohe  found widespread changes in phenology and species distributions attributable to climate warming. Despite some species' temporal stability, most exhibited change as predicted by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They found advancing spring events of 2.3 d/decade, and shifting biogeographical ranges toward the poles of 6.1 km per decade (Parmesan & Yohe, ), calling such changes a 'coherent fingerprint' of the overall effect of climate change on natural systems.Ibáñez et al.  observed that climate warming has altered both spring and autumn phenologies of many species, but found considerable interspecific variation and, for a given species, spatial variation in response to climate change. Forecasting future change, they used a long-term (1953-2005) dataset including spring and autumn plant phenological events (flowering/leaf out and leaf coloring/leaf fall, respectively) of tree, shrub and herbaceous species of temperate forests of South Korea and Japan, finding that most species currently exhibit advanced spring phenology and delayed autumn phenology, consistent with expectations, but also that autumn-based changes are more rapid than those associated with spring. The latter observation contrasts with comparable studies in Europe which show that spring events are changing more rapidly than autumn events (Menzel et al., ).For temperate forests, three relevant factors affecting the phenology of dominant tree species are photoperiod, degree of winter chilling and temperature (Körner & Basler, ). There is, however, interspecific variability in which predominant factor(s) control phenology among temperate forest species, with photoperiod increasing in importance with forest succession; that is, it is more important for long-lived, late-successional species than for short-lived, early-successional species. Although this may mitigate warming-induced change in temperate forest composition, Körner & Basler suggested that opportunistic (e.g. exotic invasive) species may benefit from a warming climate and claim a competitive advantage over photoperiod-sensitive species (Körner & Basler, ).Altered phenology is a driver of change not only for plant species, but also for animal species, creating a complex scenario for plant-animal interactions, particularly pollination. Less a problem for climax canopy hardwood species, which are almost exclusively wind-pollinated, this is irrelevant for temperate conifers, but an especially serious threat for forest herbaceous species. Potts et al.  reviewed patterns of global declines in numerous pollinator species, with an understandable focus on insects - especially bees - considering that they are the primary pollinators of both agricultural crops and wild species. Potential drivers of pollinator loss include habitat loss/fragmentation, agrochemicals, pathogens and introductions of novel species. Also included is climate change, and interactions among virtually all drivers. Effects of climate change on insect pollinators are seen on all hierarchical levels of organization, from the individual to population and community levels. Especially troublesome are the temporal and spatial mismatches between plant species and their insect pollinators, arising temporally from changes in phenology of plant and insect species, and spatially from altered distributions (Potts et al., ).Climate change-altered phenology has extended into changing life cycles among insects, an example of which is the mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae), native to western North America, and a generalist pest for the genus Pinus, often erupting epidemically, and killing wide swathes of trees throughout the region (Fig. a). Mitton & Ferrenberg  studied a recent epidemic of MPB that was an order of magnitude larger than ever recorded and extending to higher elevations/latitudes than on record. They demonstrated that, following 20 yr of increasing air temperatures in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the flight season of MPB began > 1 month earlier than historically known and extended twice that duration. More important was their novel finding that the life cycle of some broods of MPB increased from one to two generations per year (Fig. b). They explained that because this species lacks a diapause (suspension in development), its development is controlled solely by temperature. Accordingly, MPB populations currently respond to climate warming via faster development and expanse into previously inhospitable environments (Mitton & Ferrenberg, ). This work, however, was challenged by Bentz & Powell , who agreed that MPB is influenced by climate change, but stated that such studies need to consider thermally dependent traits that have evolved to maintain seasonality.Climate change interactions have been reported for other forest pest insects. DeRose et al.  combined empirical data, based on US Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis data, with three global change models to evaluate and predict the effect of increasing temperature on the distribution of spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis), which attacks spruce forests of North America. They predicted that extent of attack should increase with temperature, but that there should be time lag in response, given the long-lived nature of host spruce trees.This phenomenon is not confined to North America. Netherer & Schopf  reported similar findings from throughout Europe for defoliating insects, bark beetles and especially the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa), a defoliating insect for numerous conifer species. Its altitudinal and latitudinal distributions are controlled primarily by temperature and are already modified by climate change. Because of the prevailing oceanic climate in the Southern Hemisphere (i.e. generally lower temperatures during the growing season), climate change is predicted to promote contrasting effects on insect cycles there, as well (Deutsch et al., ).Related to climate change-mitigated alterations in phenology are similarly altered changes in biogeographical ranges of species. Again, Parmesan & Yohe  concluded that climate change has caused mean pole-ward range shifts of 6.1 km per decade. Using seven global circulation models (GCMs), Hansen et al.  projected future distributions of prominent temperate forest types of North America, including the eastern deciduous forest and western mountain/coastal forests of the United States, focusing on major tree species. These models differ in their type - equilibrium vs transient - and in assumptions of change in temperature and precipitation. Equilibrium models are older and simulate instantaneous increases in CO2, being run until equilibrium climate conditions are reached; the more recent transient models assume increases in glasshouse gases at 1% yr-1 until 2100, allowing climatic adjustment. Although specific predicted outcomes for eastern forest species varied among models (Fig. ), all concurred in predicting profound shifts in dominant species, especially the virtual elimination the maple-beech-birch forest type (one of the more species-rich forest types of the region) and loblolly-shortleaf pine, and expansion of oak-hickory and oak-pine types (Fig. ). Potential ranges for several subalpine coniferous species are predicted to contract in the western United States (data not shown). Among their conclusions is that changes in climate and land use in the future will be of a magnitude to cause even greater changes in biodiversity. Although distributions of some species, communities and biomes are likely to expand, others will contract, creating novel communities (Hansen et al., ).3. Drought/fireIn their now-classic paper, Hansen et al.  provided forecasts of several outcomes of global climate change using the three-dimensional model of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. These included increased atmospheric warming globally, with degree of warming dependent on growth of trace gas emissions. Another prediction, one relevant for the present and future of global temperate forests, was a notable increase in the frequency of extremes of weather events and conditions. Indeed, this prediction is well-supported by current data collected by the Munchener Ruckversicherungs-Gesellschaft, Geo Risks Research, NatCatSERVICE, wherein they examined global annual frequency of catastrophic disturbances 1980-2014 (Fig. ). All types of catastrophic disturbance, save earthquakes, have increased during this period. These are true extremes, indeed, considering that frequencies of both flooding and drought exhibit large increases over the c. 35 yr time period. Relevant to the current discussion is the increased frequency of drought, a disturbance not directly associated with any particular biome, but representing an especially serious threat to temperate forests (Fig. ).Forests typically develop in the temperate zone wherever there is sufficient precipitation to maintain soil moisture amounts capable of supporting tree growth and survival. Thus, the occurrence of extensive drought will have directly damaging effects on tree species. In addition to the direct limitations of drought-induced moisture stress, however, is the drought-induced increase in the frequency of fire. Wildfire activity has not only been predicted to increase in the future under a climate warming scenario, but also such increases are hypothesized to bring about biogeographical shifts that reduce the resilience of fire-prone forests worldwide (Harvey et al., ). Although the relative contribution of fire to forest decline is greatest in the boreal forest, fire still represents a threat to temperate forests, especially conifer forests already weakened by drought (Hansen et al., ). Harvey et al.  tested two hypotheses associated with this observation in fire-prone subalpine (largely conifer) forests in the Rocky Mountains of the United States: (1) availability of viable seeds will decrease in large patches following stand-replacing fire, and (2) seedling establishment and survival will decline measurably following post-fire drought. They found that total tree seedling establishment declined sharply post-fire with greater drought severity and with greater distance to seed source. Many responses exhibited interspecific variation, suggesting fire/drought-induced changes in forest composition. They concluded that, given the predicted increase in frequency of drought and wildfire in the future, post-fire tree seedling establishment of these forests could be reduced substantially. Although some of these reductions might be offset by compensatory increases from lower montane and upper timberline species, important near- to mid-term shifts in the composition and structure of high-elevation forests will occur under continued climate warming and increased wildfire activity.Not part of their study, yet no less important, is the interaction of drought and fire with increases in extent and severity of forests pests, as discussed in Mitton & Ferrenberg  in North America and Netherer & Schopf  in Europe. That is, the scene depicted in Fig. (a) of wide swathes of insect-killed stems is of trees more susceptible to insect death because of drought stress, and simultaneously represents substantial fuel for intense fires. Furthermore, McDowell et al.  established a close connection between climate change-enhanced drought and increases in pests for temperate forests of North America.878V.V. EpilogueRegrettably, climate change has been insinuated into the current political arena - especially in the United States, but also elsewhere around the world - wherein agenda-driven politics seek to deny its scientific reality (I remind my students that mixing politics and science is like mixing manure and ice cream - it never helps the manure, but always ruins the ice cream). In spite of this, and to a real degree because of it, climate change will continue to threaten global ecosystems in general, and temperate forests in particular, for many years in the future. It is quite compelling that, in spite of misrepresentations to the contrary, numerous long-term predictions from the past regarding climate change have largely survived scientific scrutiny. Certainly, predictions of Hansen et al.  nearly 30 yr ago have all been essentially supported, especially regarding climate change-mediated extremes of weather (Fig. ).Climate change, however, is only a part, albeit the lion's share, of global change, comprising myriad other drivers, most of which have been exposited herein. Franklin et al.  developed a conceptual model of the effects of these drivers - climate change, altered disturbance regimes, invasive species/novel species assemblages, land-use change - on terrestrial ecosystems using multiple lines of evidence. These include observations for attribution, experiments for identifying mechanisms, and use of models at multiple scales of ecological organization for verification (Fig. ). Although this model was developed as a set of general guidelines for all ecosystems of the biosphere, it seems particularly applicable to temperate forests, considering (1) the chronic alteration of these forests by human populations, and (2) their temperate nature, wherein growing/dormant seasons are an integral part of their structure and function. Such a model provides a strong base not only for ongoing scientific inquiry and understanding, but also in informing mitigation policy. Although the science to date has provided sufficient evidence providing the impetus for policy changes, there is still a clear need for further basic scientific research. Climate change is unquestionably a complex phenomenon that can be best understood only by a complex of scientific approaches, involving empirical field monitoring, manipulative field experiments and laboratory simulations, all coupled with modeling (e.g. DeRose et al., ).Finally, I suspect that I am not alone among plant ecologists in considering Sir Arthur Tansley as a professional 'hero,' a truly inspirational visionary in our field, and one who clearly articulated many ecological concepts we embrace today. Although it is an honor to write a review bearing his name, I cannot imagine that he, in his day, would have conceived the truly global scale of our 'modern' alteration of climate. Still, he deeply appreciated the profoundly negative influence human activity can have on the very ecosystems that he not only 'coined,' but on which our sustainability depends. Appropriately, I allow Sir Arthur to conclude:It would be difficult, not to say impossible, to draw a natural line between the activities of the human tribes which presumably fitted into and formed parts of 'biotic communities' and the destructive human activities of the modern world...Regarded as an exceptionally powerful biotic factor which increasingly upsets the equilibrium of preexisting ecosystems and eventually destroys them, at the same time forming new ones of very different nature, human activity finds its proper place in ecology.

Their keen collective insight leading to vast improvements in concepts and content is deeply appreciated.884References 884SummaryHumans have long utilized resources from all forest biomes, but the most indelible anthropogenic signature has been the expanse of human populations in temperate forests. The purpose of this review is to bring into focus the diverse forests of the temperate region of the biosphere, including those of hardwood, conifer and mixed dominance, with a particular emphasis on crucial challenges for the future of these forested areas. Implicit in the term 'temperate' is that the predominant climate of these forest regions has distinct cyclic, seasonal changes involving periods of growth and dormancy. The specific temporal patterns of seasonal change, however, display an impressive variability among temperate forest regions. In addition to the more apparent current anthropogenic disturbances of temperate forests, such as forest management and conversion to agriculture, human alteration of temperate forests is actually an ancient phenomenon, going as far back as 7000 yr before present (bp). As deep-seated as these past legacies are for temperate forests, all current and future perturbations, including timber harvesting, excess nitrogen deposition, altered species' phenologies, and increasing frequency of drought and fire, must be viewed through the lens of climate change.",2016,"12-01","New Phytologist (Online)","212","4","871","","https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14255","","#25030","Gilliam 2016","Laura  Dee (2024-08-23 01:43:09)(Select): New Phytologist isnt a book; Anna LoPresti (2024-07-16 08:46:33)(Screen): are we including books?;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

To investigate the risks and benefits of AM, old provenance trials have been repurposed and new common-garden experiments initiated. In this paper, we review three decades of common-garden based research into the adaptation of species and provenances (geographically specific varieties) to current and future climates in North America. Using a filtered data base of 106 papers and reports, we investigate multiple aspects of this work, including subject species, tree response variables and their climatic predictors, statistical techniques, and the patterns of adaptation revealed in results. Although the reviewed work contained valuable insights into provenance-climate relationships, much of this work focused on growth in commercial conifer species and the correlation of that growth with annual or monthly climatic averages. A minority of studies investigated the effects of climate variables with direct mechanistic effects on growth or phenology, including temperature extremes, frost and drought indices, or growing-season duration. Furthermore, recent research has opened new avenues of investigation into the influence of local soil and topographic variables, and even ectomycorrhizal communities over provenance performance. We make the case that future common-garden research into provenance-climate relationships should focus on climatic variables with demonstrated mechanistic connections to growth, survival, and phenology. The effects of extreme weather merit particular attention because extreme weather is likely to be a key determinant of long-term tree health and persistence.",2023,"06-01","Forest Ecology and Management","537 p.120854-","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2023.120854","","#25940","Park 2023","Laura  Dee (2024-08-14 07:14:34)(Select): definitely include in the intervention response section of the chapter;","Biotic; Intervention; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"44",246,"Climate-Driven Reshuffling of Species and Genes: Potential Conservation Roles for Species Translocations and Recombinant Hybrid Genotypes","Scriber, Jon Mark"," Comprising 50%-75% of the world's fauna, insects are a prominent part of biodiversity in communities and ecosystems globally. Biodiversity across all levels of biological classifications is fundamentally based on genetic diversity. However, the integration of genomics and phylogenetics into conservation management may not be as rapid as climate change. The genetics of hybrid introgression as a source of novel variation for ecological divergence and evolutionary speciation (and resilience) may generate adaptive potential and diversity fast enough to respond to locally-altered environmental conditions. Major plant and herbivore hybrid zones with associated communities deserve conservation consideration. This review addresses functional genetics across multi-trophic-level interactions including """"""""invasive species"""""""" in various ecosystems as they may become disrupted in different ways by rapid climate change. """"""""Invasive genes"""""""" (into new species and populations) need to be recognized for their positive creative potential and addressed in conservation programs. """"""""Genetic rescue"""""""" via hybrid translocations may provide needed adaptive flexibility for rapid adaptation to environmental change. While concerns persist for some conservationists, this review emphasizes the positive aspects of hybrids and hybridization. Specific implications of natural genetic introgression are addressed with a few examples from butterflies, including transgressive phenotypes and climate-driven homoploid recombinant hybrid speciation. Some specific examples illustrate these points using the swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae) with their long-term historical data base (phylogeographical diversity changes) and recent (3-decade) climate-driven temporal and genetic divergence in recombinant homoploid hybrids and relatively recent hybrid speciation of Papilio appalachiensis in North America.

"45",250,"Impacts of climate warming on hybrid zone movement: Geographically diffuse and biologically porous aspecies bordersa","Scriber, JMark","Abstract The ecology and evolutionary biology of insect-plant associations has realized extensive attention, especially during the past 60 years. The classifications (categorical designations) of continuous variation in biodiversity, ranging from global patterns (e.g., latitudinal gradients in species richness/diversity and degree of herbivore feeding specialization) to localized insect-plant associations that span the biospectrum from polyphenisms, polymorphisms, biotypes, demes, host races, to cryptic species, remain academically contentious. Semantic and biosystematic (taxonomical) disagreements sometimes detract from more important ecological and evolutionary processes that drive diversification, the dynamics of gene flow and local extinctions. This review addresses several aspects of insect specialization, host-associated divergence and ecological (including """"""""hybrid"""""""") speciation, with special reference to the climate warming impacts on species borders of hybridizing swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae). Interspecific hybrid introgression may result in collapse of multi-species communities or increase species numbers via homoploid hybrid speciation. We may see diverging, merging, or emerging genotypes across hybrid zones, all part of the ongoing processes of evolution. Molecular analyses of genetic mosaics and genomic dynamics with """"""""divergence hitchhiking"""""""", combined with ecological, ethological and physiological studies of """"""""species porosity"""""""", have already begun to unveil some answers for some important ecological/evolutionary questions. (i) How rapidly can host-associated divergence lead to new species (and why doesn't it always do so, e.g., resulting in """"""""incomplete"""""""" speciation)? (ii) How might """"""""speciation genes"""""""" function, and how/where would we find them? (iii) Can oscillations from specialists to generalists and back to specialists help explain global diversity in herbivorous insects? (iv) How could recombinant interspecific hybridization lead to divergence and speciation? From ancient phytochemically defined angiosperm affiliations to recent and very local geographical mosaics, the Papilionidae (swallowtail butterflies) have provided a model for enhanced understanding of ecological patterns and evolutionary processes, including host-associated genetic divergence, genomic mosaics, genetic hitchhiking and sex-linked speciation genes. Apparent homoploid hybrid speciation in Papilio appears to have been catalyzed by climate warming-induced interspecific introgression of some, but not all, species diagnostic traits, reflecting strong divergent selection (discordant), especially on the Z (= X) chromosome. Reproductive isolation of these novel recombinant hybrid genotypes appears to be accomplished via a delayed post-diapause emergence or temporal isolation, and is perhaps aided by the thermal landscape. Changing thermal landscapes appear to have created (and may destroy) novel recombinant hybrid genotypes and hybrid species.",2011,"04-01","Insect Science","18","2","121-159","","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7917.2010.01367.x","","#27059","Scriber 2011","Grace Westphal (2024-08-16 03:57:42)(Select): Transboundary discussion is limited to US and Canada (mentioned only once), but the ideas in here about range limits / traits based on climates seems broadly useful; ","Biotic; Transboundary unclear; save for other sections",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"46",256,"Context dependency of animal resource subsidies.","Subalusky, Amanda L; Post, David M","The transport of resource subsidies by animals has been documented across a range of species and ecosystems. Although many of these studies have shown that animal resource subsidies can have significant effects on nutrient cycling, ecosystem productivity, and food-web structure, there is a great deal of variability in the occurrence and strength of these effects. Here we propose a conceptual framework for understanding the context dependency of animal resource subsidies, and for developing and testing predictions about the effects of animal subsidies over space and time. We propose a general framework, in which abiotic characteristics and animal vector characteristics from the donor ecosystem interact to determine the quantity, quality, timing, and duration (QQTD) of an animal input. The animal input is translated through the lens of recipient ecosystem characteristics, which include both abiotic and consumer characteristics, to yield the QQTD of the subsidy. The translated subsidy influences recipient ecosystem dynamics through effects on both trophic structure and ecosystem function, which may both influence the recipient ecosystem's response to further inputs and feed back to influence the donor ecosystem. We present a review of research on animal resource subsidies across ecosystem boundaries, placed within the context of this framework, and we discuss how the QQTD of resource subsidies can influence trophic structure and ecosystem function in recipient ecosystems. We explore the importance of understanding context dependency of animal resource subsidies in increasingly altered ecosystems, in which the characteristics of both animal vectors and donor and recipient ecosystems may be changing rapidly. Finally, we make recommendations for future research on animal resource subsidies, and resource subsidies in general, that will increase our understanding and predictive capacity about their ecosystem effects.",2019,"04-01","Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society","94","2","517-538","","https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12465","","#28864","Subalusky 2019","Laura  Dee (2024-10-18 08:31:27)(Select): GREAT background for the chapter, agree not very specific to North America but the framework and types of biotic flows are relevant; Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-17 12:48:57)(Select): There is not enough specific examples to be useful for transboundary.
