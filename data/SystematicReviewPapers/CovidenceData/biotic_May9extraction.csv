"1",5,"A Systematic Review of the Effects of Temperature on <i>Anopheles</i> Mosquito Development and Survival: Implications for Malaria Control in a Future Warmer Climate","Agyekum, T. P.; Botwe, P. K.; Arko-Mensah, J.; Issah, I.; Acquah, A. A.; Hogarh, J. N.; Dwomoh, D.; Robins, T. G.; Fobil, J. N.","The rearing temperature of the immature stages can have a significant impact on the life-history traits and the ability of adult mosquitoes to transmit diseases. This review assessed published evidence of the effects of temperature on the immature stages, life-history traits, insecticide susceptibility, and expression of enzymes in the adult Anopheles mosquito. Original articles published through 31 March 2021 were systematically retrieved from Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. After applying eligibility criteria, 29 studies were included. The review revealed that immature stages of An. arabiensis were more tolerant (in terms of survival) to a higher temperature than An. funestus and An. quadriannulatus. Higher temperatures resulted in smaller larval sizes and decreased hatching and pupation time. The development rate and survival of An. stephensi was significantly reduced at a higher temperature than a lower temperature. Increasing temperatures decreased the longevity, body size, length of the gonotrophic cycle, and fecundity of Anopheles mosquitoes. Higher rearing temperatures increased pyrethroid resistance in adults of the An. arabiensis SENN DDT strain, and increased pyrethroid tolerance in the An. arabiensis SENN strain. Increasing temperature also significantly increased Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) expression and decreased insecticide toxicity. Both extreme low and high temperatures affect Anopheles mosquito development and survival. Climate change could have diverse effects on Anopheles mosquitoes. The sensitivities of Anopeheles mosquitoes to temperature differ from species to species, even among the same complex. Notwithstanding, there seem to be limited studies on the effects of temperature on adult life-history traits of Anopheles mosquitoes, and more studies are needed to clarify this relationship.",2021,"JUL","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","18","14","","WOS:000677349100001","10.3390/ijerph18147255","","#154","Agyekum 2021","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-10 06:47:59)(Select): some of the papers reviewed are from north america (see figure 2). paper touches on northward shifting disease vectors, transboundary in North America is implicit but not explicit; ","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

J.; Ruiz-Sánchez, A.","Of the approximately 716 bird species that breed in North America, 386 (54%) are considered Nearctic-Neotropical migrants by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In the past 50 yr, scores of these migratory species, including some once considered common, have declined dramatically. Nearctic-Neotropical migrants normally spend 6-8 months in tropical habitats, making the identification, availability, and management of Neotropical habitats critical issues for their conservation. Yet, for most species, complete and nuanced information about their use of tropical habitats and the relative effects of breeding vs. wintering conditions on survival, productivity, and population trends is not available, though many studies point to Neotropical overwintering habitats as being a strong driver of population change. Particularly important for long-distance Nearctic-Neotropical migrants is an understanding of how""""""""carry-over effects"""""""" arise and influence population trends when conditions on wintering grounds and tropical stopover areas affect subsequent reproductive performance on breeding grounds. For example, why some species show strong carry-over effects from tropical habitats while others do not is not fully understood. I n recent years, many studies have offered insights into these issues by taking advantage of new scientific methods and technological innovations. In this review, we explore threats facing North American breeding birds that migrate to the Neotropics, summarize knowledge of habitat selection and use on the wintering grounds, describe how conditions at one point in the annual cycle may manifest in subsequent seasons or life history stages, and discuss conservation concerns such as climate change and the potential for phenological mismatch.",2020,"NOV","Condor","122","4","","WOS:000612517800020","10.1093/condor/duaa055","","#269","Albert 2020","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

In the Review, Baker, Metcalf and colleagues examine how global change affects infectious diseases, highlighting examples ranging from COVID-19 to Zika virus disease.

The 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak, the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak, the 2013-2016 Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa and the 2015 Zika virus disease epidemic all resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality while spreading across borders to infect people in multiple countries. At the same time, the past few decades have ushered in an unprecedented era of technological, demographic and climatic change: airline flights have doubled since 2000, since 2007 more people live in urban areas than rural areas, population numbers continue to climb and climate change presents an escalating threat to society.

"4",20,"Assessing global biome exposure to climate change through the Holocene-Anthropocene transition","Benito-Garzón, M.; Leadley, P. W.; Fernández-Manjarrés, J. F.","AimTo analyse global patterns of climate during the mid-Holocene and conduct comparisons with pre-industrial and projected future climates. In particular, to assess the exposure of terrestrial biomes and ecoregions to climate-related risks during the Holocene-Anthropocene transition starting at the pre-industrial period. LocationTerrestrial ecosystems of the Earth. MethodsWe calculated long-term climate differences (anomalies) between the mid-Holocene (6 ka cal bp, mH), pre-industrial conditions and projections for 2100 (middle-strength A1B scenario) using six global circulation models available for all periods. Climate differences were synthesized with multivariate statistics and average principal component loadings of temperature and precipitation differences (an estimate of climate-related risks) were calculated on 14 biomes and 766 ecoregions. ResultsOur results suggest that most of the Earth's biomes will probably undergo changes beyond the mH recorded levels of community turnover and range shifts because the magnitude of climate anomalies expected in the future are greater than observed during the mH. A few biomes, like the remnants of North American and Euro-Asian prairies, may experience only slightly greater degrees of climate change in the future as compared with the mH. In addition to recent studies that have identified equatorial regions as the most sensitive to future climate change, we find that boreal forest, tundra and vegetation of the Equatorial Andes could be at greatest risk, since these regions will be exposed to future climates that are well outside natural climate variation during the Holocene. ConclusionsThe Holocene-Anthropocene climate transition, even for a middle-strength future climate change scenario, appears to be of greater magnitude and different from that between the mH and the pre-industrial period. As a consequence, community- and biome-level changes due to of expected climate change may be different in the future from those observed during the mH.",2014,"FEB","Global Ecology and Biogeography","23","2","235-244","WOS:000329139600010","10.1111/geb.12097","","#1063","Benito-Garzón 2014","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA
"5",24,"Dieback of riparian alder caused by the <i>Phytophthora alni</i> complex: projected consequences for stream ecosystems","Bjelke, U.; Boberg, J.; Oliva, J.; Tattersdill, K.; McKie, B. G.","Alder trees (Alnus spp.) are key nitrogen-fixing riparian species in the northern hemisphere. Inputs of nitrogen-rich leaf litter from alder into stream food webs can contribute significantly to nitrogen dynamics at local and landscape scales. Alder trees also provide habitats for terrestrial and aquatic organisms, and help stabilize river banks. Recently, substantial declines in alder stands have occurred along streams in Europe, with damages observed in some parts of North America also. A major driver has been the invasive oomycete pathogen Phytophthora alni species complex, which can spread rapidly along stream networks. This review synthesises information on the pathogen, processes of spread and infection, and its impacts on alder. We further address the potential ecosystem-level and management consequences of the decline of alder, and highlight research needs. The alder dieback caused by P. alni is associated with reductions in shade and quality and quantity of leaf litter. A decline in the structural integrity of branches and roots further threatens bank stability. Stream banks dominated by other tree species or no trees at all will result in ecosystem-level changes both above and below the waterline. The P. alni taxonomic complex includes different species with varying phenotypes. An improved understanding of their environmental tolerances, virulence and evolution, along with the processes regulating the spread and impacts of the pathogen, would assist in identification of the riparian and stream systems most vulnerable not only to invasion but also to the heaviest disease outbreaks and ecosystem-level impacts. Within the P. alni complex, the highly pathogenic hybrid species P. x alni is favoured by mild winters and warm, but not excessively hot summer temperatures suggesting possible changes in distribution and level of impact under future global climate change.",2016,"MAY","Freshwater Biology","61","5","565-579","WOS:000373833400001","10.1111/fwb.12729","","#1231","Bjelke 2016","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

The aquatic plants of the genus Elodea are potential invaders to Arctic and Subarctic ecosystems circumpolar and at least one species is already established in Alaska, USA. To illustrate the problems of preventing, eradicating, containing, and mitigating aquatic, invasive plants in Arctic and Subarctic ecosystems, we review the invasion dynamics of Elodea and provide recommendations for research and management efforts in Alaska. Foremost, we conclude the remoteness of Arctic and Subarctic systems such as Alaska is no longer a protective attribute against invasions, as transportation pathways now reach throughout these regions.

T.","Barnacles are some of the most conspicuous and well-known ship fouling organisms in the world and thus many species no doubt owe parts of their modern distribution to human-mediated translocations over the past several centuries. Reviewed here, as a window into global patterns, are the introduced, cryptogenic, and range expanding barnacles of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North and South America. Five species of thoracic barnacles have invaded the Pacific coasts of the Americas: Amphibalanus improvisus, A. eburneus, and A. subalbidus, all from the Atlantic, and A. amphitrite and A. reticulatus from the Indo-West Pacific. Seven species have invaded the Atlantic coasts of the Americas; six of these are from the Pacific: A. amphitrite and A. reticulatus (shared as invaders with the Pacific coast), and Balanus trigonus, B. glandula, Striatobalanus amaryllis, and Megabalanus coccopoma. The Western North Atlantic A. subalbidus has invaded the Western South Atlantic. Striking are the few barnacle invasions that have occurred on the Pacific coast of South America and these species (A. improvisus, A. amphitrite and A. reticulatus) are reported only from northernmost locations (Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru). For the first 100 years (1853-1955) two species, A. amphitrite and A. improvisus, constituted the majority of invasion events in the Americas, the sole exception being the arrival of the Pacific Balanus trigonus in the 1860s and 1870s in the Atlantic. After 1955, the first records of invasions of A. reticulatus, A. eburneus, B. glandula, M. coccopoma, and S. amaryllis appear, an increased diversity of introductions in close concert with general observations of increasing invasions globally of marine organisms after World War II. Known since the 1970s in Brazil, M. coccopoma appears to be responding to warming northern latitudes and has expanded to North Carolina as of 2005. The native Western Atlantic barnacle Chthamalus fragilis arrived in New England in the 1890s, a range expansion perhaps facilitated by an earlier coastal warming period concomitant with the decline in abundance of its colder-water competitor Semibalanus balanoides, although the latter also appears to have expanded south on the North American Atlantic coast in the twentieth century due to increased habitat availability. Chthamalus is predicted to move north, and Semibalanus is predicted to return to its historical range, both due to continued warming. In turn, the native Eastern North Pacific barnacle Tetraclita rubescens is expanding north due to coastal warming as well. Future invasion scenarios include increased introductions facilitated through a newly expanded Panama Canal, the potential arrival of Austrominius modestus on the North American Atlantic coast (despite its failure to do so throughout the last half of the twentieth century), and the arrival on the warmer North and Central American Pacific coasts of Chthamalus proteus.",2011,"","IN THE WRONG PLACE - ALIEN MARINE CRUSTACEANS: DISTRIBUTION, BIOLOGY AND IMPACTS","6","","159-213","WOS:000293984800005","10.1007/978-94-007-0591-3_510.1007/978-94-007-0591-3","","#1852","Carlton 2011","","Biotic",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

"9",49,"Arctic marine ecosystems face increasing climate stress","Deb, J. C.; Bailey, S. A.","Arctic warming is occurring at amuch faster rate than in other parts of the globe, with potentially devastating consequences for the diverse array of species within ecologically and biologically sensitive areas in the Arctic marine region. However, climate change research in this region is sparse compared to other biomes, hindering conservation efforts. In this article, we review and synthesize the available literature to understand the observed and potential impacts of climate change on different species and ecosystems in the Arctic marine region. We reviewed 253 articles reporting changes in species and ecosystems in the Arctic marine region in response to climate change (225 studies documenting observed impacts and 28 reporting predicted impacts). The review revealed that most research effort has been concentrated in only a subset of Arctic Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) (5/18 LMEs), with the majority of Arctic LMEs being poorly studied. The majority of the reviewed papers focused on marine mammals (19%) followed by microalgae (17%). A number of studies documented variability in planktonic communities (microalgae, macroalgae, zooplankton), resulting in alteration in ecosystem structure and function. Reproductive failure, decline in populations, and changes in diet composition, behavior, and breeding biology were reported for sea birds and mammals. Further, shifts in spatial distribution of fishes were observed by several studies. This review provides persuasive evidence that multiple climate change indices in the Arctic region are changing, with impacts on almost all components of marine biotic ecosystems (from plankton to top predators). We identify a number of gaps (such as limited inventory of biota, robustness of data supporting climate change indices on an Arctic Ocean scale, and climate suitability assessment for all species) in climate change research in Arctic marine ecosystems where future studies can help to quantify the impacts of climate change on species and ecosystems and advance understanding for their adaptive management.",2023,"SEP","Environmental Reviews","31","3","403-451","WOS:000963001200001","10.1139/er-2022-0101","","#2881","Deb 2023","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-19 04:28:12)(Select): This definitely relates to biodiversity + climate change.

Because of a coincidence of high species richness and human presence, Mediterranean biodiversity is particularly threatened by processes such as habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss, pollution, climate change and introduction of invasive species. Invasive tree pathogens are among the problematic exotic species of California, Chile, the Mediterranean, South Africa and Australia. In this review, we provide an update on a selection of non-native tree pathogens currently posing a threat in Mediterranean ecosystems. The impact of exotic forest pathogens range from large-scale tree and shrub mortality in native ecosystems (Phytophthora ramorum on the West Coast of the USA) to disruption of plantations of exotic (e.g., Seiridium cardinale on planted Monterey cypress in California, Fusarium circinatum on Monterey pine worldwide) and native trees (introduction of the North American Heterobasidion irregulare in stone pine woodland in Italy). Genetic analyses are instrumental in improving our understanding and management of these outbreaks. There is a need for more empirical data on how novel pathosystems are likely to develop under novel climates, as well as interdisciplinary collaborations among forest pathologists, theoretical modellers and climatologists.

S.; Hotaling, S.","Rapid recession of glaciers and snowfields is threatening the habitats of cold-water biodiversity worldwide. In many ice-sourced headwaters of western North America, stoneflies in the genus Lednia (Plecoptera: Nemouridae) are a prominent member of the invertebrate community. With a broad distribution in mountain streams and close ties to declining glacier cover, Lednia has emerged as a sentinel of climate change threats to high-elevation aquatic biodiversity. Lednia tumana, which is endemic to Glacier National Park, USA and the surrounding mountains, is the most well-studied species in the genus and in 2019 became federally protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) due to climate-induced loss of meltwater habitats. Three other Lednia species have also been described, and like L. tumana, each is endemic to a mountain region of western North America: Lednia sierra in the Sierra Nevada, Lednia borealis in the Cascade Range, and Lednia tetonica in the Teton Range. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of Lednia ecology, genetics, and physiology, with an emphasis on the conservation outlook for the group and species with similar headwater distributions. We highlight substantial progress made in the last decade to better understand the ecology and evolution of Lednia, including the identification of 140 Lednia-containing streams (an increase from 12 streams in 2010), and a more complete understanding of the degree to which warming streams may imperil species in the genus. In light of the ESA listing of L. tumana, we show that similar conservation threats likely face all extant Lednia species. However, substantial gaps in our knowledge remain, primarily centering around their distributions (and the potential for as yet undescribed species), life history, ecophysiology, and trophic ecology.

O.","A systematic synthesis of phreatophytes' responses to groundwater drawdown would provide a more complete picture of groundwater-related research aimed at the sustainable management of groundwater-dependent ecosystems amid climate change. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the ecophysiological effects of groundwater drawdown on phreatophytes and methodological approaches were synthesized from peer-reviewed articles published from 1988 to 2022. The highest relative count of studies was found in arid and semi-arid high-income countries, such as Australia and North America (18-24%), while the lowest relative count to no data was found in hyper-arid countries, such as north African countries (0-3.65%). The groundwater depth effects on phreatophyte ecophysiology had the highest relative count (53.65%), followed by large-scale tree plantation effects on the groundwater characteristics (44.37%) and groundwater depth and biological invasion relationship (1.99%). The results revealed that as the groundwater depth increased, the phreatophytic vegetation growth, productivity, and community structure decreased across the ecosystem types. A groundwater withdrawal also had a significant impact on the physiology of the phreatophytes, specifically on the transpiration rate, xylem water potential, hydraulic conductance, and photosynthetic rate. Many of the reviewed studies concluded that large-scale tree plantations can deplete groundwater resources due to an increased evapotranspiration rate. Further, species' diversity, evenness, dominance, composition, and distribution, as well as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), are commonly measured parameters in the reviewed studies through vegetation and groundwater monitoring.

As fire regimes change, it is important to understand how mammals respond to these altered post-fire landscapes. Because fires vary in size, severity and landscape context, it is important to know the experimental designs and response variables used to address post-fire responses of mammals. We analysed 48 papers published from 1988 to 2015 that examined responses of small mammals to natural or prescribed fire in North American conifer forests. These papers used different experimental contrasts (e.g. burned vs unburned sites, time series, within-fire heterogeneity). Most studies (89.6%) presented species richness or index-derived abundances of common species as their response variable(s). Many studies did not fully describe the fires being examined; these omissions make it more difficult to interpret and compare results among studies. The limited scope of inference presented by the papers in this review leads us to recommend a minimal set of information that should be presented about each fire studied.

The causative agent, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), belongs to the Orbivirus genus and leads to significant regional disease outbreaks among livestock and wildlife in North America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, causing significant morbidity and mortality. During the past decade, this viral disease has become a real threat for countries of the Mediterranean basin, with the recent occurrence of several important outbreaks in livestock. Moreover, the European Union registered the first cases of EHDV ever detected within its territory. Competent vectors involved in viral transmission, Culicoides midges, are expanding its distribution, conceivably due to global climate change. Therefore, livestock and wild ruminants around the globe are at risk for this serious disease.

M.","Vector-borne disease incidence and burden are on the rise. Weather events and climate patterns are known to influence vector populations and disease distribution and incidence. Changes in weather trends and climatic factors can shift seasonal vector activity and host behavior, thus altering pathogen distribution and introducing diseases to new geographic regions. With the upward trend in global temperature, changes in the incidence and distribution of disease vectors possibly linked to climate change have been documented. Forecasting and modeling efforts are valuable for incorporating climate into predicting changes in vector and vector-borne disease distribution. These predictions serve to optimize disease outbreak preparedness and response. The purpose of this scoping review was to describe the use of climate data in vector-borne disease prediction in North America between 2000 and 2022. The most investigated diseases were West Nile virus infection, Lyme disease, and dengue. The uneven geographical distribution of publications could suggest regional differences in the availability of surveillance data required for vector-borne disease predictions and forecasts across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Studies incorporated environmental data from ground-based sources, satellite data, previously existing data, and field-collected data. While environmental data such as meteorological and topographic factors were well-represented, further research is warranted to ascertain if relationships with less common variables, such as oceanographic characteristics and drought, hold among various vector populations and throughout wider geographical areas.

Environmental changes in human disturbance, land use and climate are predicted to have widespread impacts on interactions between species, especially in the order Lagomorpha due to the higher latitudes and more extreme environmental conditions they occupy. We reviewed the published literature on interspecific interactions in the order Lagomorpha and compared the biogeography, macroecology, phylogeny and traits of species known to interact with those of species with no reported interactions, to investigate how projected future environmental change may affect interactions and potentially alter species' distributions. Thirty-three lagomorph species have competitive interactions reported in the literature; the majority involve hares (Lepus sp.) or the eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus). Key regions for interactions are located between 30-50 degrees N of the Equator, and include eastern Asia (southern Russia on the border of Mongolia) and North America (north-western USA). Closely related, large-bodied, similarly sized species occurring in regions of human-modified, typically agricultural landscapes, or at high elevations, are significantly more likely to have reported competitive interactions than other lagomorph species. We identify species' traits associated with competitive interactions, and highlight some potential impacts that future environmental change may have on interspecific interactions. Our approach using bibliometric and biological data is widely applicable, and with relatively straightforward methodologies, can provide insights into interactions between species.

R.","Patterns of woody-plant mortality have been linked to global-scale environmental changes, such as extreme drought, heat stress, more frequent and intense fires, and episodic outbreaks of insects and pathogens. Although many studies have focussed on survival and mortality in response to specific physiological stresses, little attention has been paid to the role of genetic heritability of traits and local adaptation in influencing patterns of plant mortality, especially in non-native species. Tamarix spp. is a dominant, non-native riparian tree in western North America that is experiencing dieback in some areas of its range due to episodic herbivory by the recently introduced northern tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda carinulata). We propose that genotype x environment interactions largely underpin current and future patterns of Tamarix mortality. We anticipate that (i) despite its recent introduction, and the potential for significant gene flow, Tamarix in western North America is generally adapted to local environmental conditions across its current range in part due to hybridization of two species; (ii) local adaptation to specific climate, soil and resource availability will yield predictable responses to episodic herbivory; and (iii) the ability to cope with a combination of episodic herbivory and increased aridity associated with climate change will be largely based on functional tradeoffs in resource allocation. This review focusses on the potential heritability of plant carbon allocation patterns in Tamarix, focussing on the relative contribution of acquired carbon to non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools versus other sinks as the basis for surviving episodic disturbance. Where high aridity and/or poor edaphic position lead to chronic stress, NSC pools may fall below a minimum threshold because of an imbalance between the supply of carbon and its demand by various sinks. Identifying patterns of local adaptation of traits related to resource allocation will improve forecasting of Tamarix population susceptibility to episodic herbivory.",2017,"MAR 28","Conservation Physiology","5","","","WOS:000402600900001","10.1093/conphys/cox016","","#7357","Long 2017","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-16 07:09:31)(Select): including, as paper mentions southwestern USA and northern Mexico; Dayo Osinubi (2024-08-11 04:25:57)(Select): Review of local adaptations in an introduced or invasive plant species (Tamarix).

M.","Pinus strobiformis (southwestern white pine) is one of the least studied and understood five-needle white pine species in North America. Recently, this species has become increasingly challenged by Cronartium ribicola (white pine blister rust). This review examines literature relevant to P. strobiformis taxonomy, environmental associations, community associations, stand dynamics, and fire and disturbance ecology in order to better inform the management of this understudied species. In its US range, P. strobiformis occurs in central and southern Arizona and New Mexico and western Texas and has been documented as far north as southwestern Colorado. In Mexico, it occurs in northeastern Sonora, western Chihuahua and Durango, northern Zacatecas, southern Coahuila and central Nuevo Leon. Although P. strobiformis is a relatively high-elevation species preferring mesic habitats, it occurs across a variety of aspects, slope positions, and elevations. It rarely dominates forest composition but is most often found in complex species mixtures. While located in mixed-conifer habitats at the northern end of its range, it is associated with more diverse forest communities in the southern part of its range. Studies generally indicate P. strobiformis is a mid-seral species, although its low abundance and broad environmental amplitude complicate classification. Regeneration ecology is poorly understood, but bird and rodent seed dispersal do occur in portions of its range. Historical fire regimes in P. strobiformis mixed-conifer forests in the US were primarily characterized by frequent, low-severity surface fire, with less evidence of mixed- and high-severity fire. In Mexico, low-severity surface fire appears to have been ubiquitous within P. strobiformis habitats, with historical fire regimes still largely intact. Information is limited on the effects of disturbances other than fire. Increased temperatures and drought severity associated with climate change could potentially shrink the distribution of P. strobiformis, while altering its dominance in future forest communities. Future research on the ecology and management of P. strobiformis is necessary to effectively manage this species given climate change and white pine blister rust selection pressure.

P.","Aim Recent and rapid warming is reorganizing terrestrial vegetation, creating novel species assemblages, and shifting range limits. Relative to the evergreen species that currently dominate much of the boreal forest landscape, Larix (larch) distributions may be particularly responsive to climatic change due to their deciduous habit, and quick growth and reproduction. Here, we amassed data from 83 studies to describe and explain observed patterns of Larix range shifts under contemporary climate change. Location Northern hemisphere. Taxon Species of the genus Larix, deciduous gymnosperms. Methods With 181 observations of Larix range limit dynamics, we used five distribution parameters (tree line advance, stand infilling, tree line recession, stand thinning, no response) and their determinants (climate, land use change, natural disturbance) to describe and explain observed patterns of Larix range shifts under contemporary climate change. We ran a redundancy analysis on the matrix of five distribution parameters considered with other climatic and nonclimatic parameters as explanatory variables. We also characterized the climatic niche of Larix species (temperature and precipitation) and how the niche has changed during the 20th century. Results Of 173 sites studied over the full distribution of Larix, 63% experienced Larix population increases, 18% had population decreases, and no response was detected at 19% of sites. Latitudinal Larix tree lines in Siberia and North America appear to be infilling and shifting their distributions northward, whereas Larix recession and thinning was more common in southern regions, suggesting southern populations may be experiencing greater drought stress than their northern counterparts. Climatic niches of most Larix species shifted towards warmer and wetter conditions, with tree line advance/forest infilling in cool/dry climate space, and recession/thinning in warm/dry space. Main conclusions Northern expansion is underway or seems imminent for boreal Larix species, primarily L. laricina in North America. Retraction in southern regions and disappearance of some mountainous populations may be inevitable due to their narrow ecological niches. Species restricted to mountainous habitats may expand locally, though will likely not contribute to broad scale range expansion.

P.; Erickson, T.","Introduction Climate change has been scientifically documented, and its effects on wildlife have been prognosticated. We sought to predict the overall impact of climate change on venomous terrestrial species. We hypothesize that given the close relationship between terrestrial venomous species and climate, a changing global environment may result in increased species migration, geographical redistribution, and longer seasons for envenomation, which would have repercussions on human health. Methods A retrospective analysis of environmental, ecological, and medical literature was performed with a focus on climate change, toxinology, and future modeling specific to venomous terrestrial creatures. Species included venomous reptiles, snakes, arthropods, spiders, and Hymenoptera (ants and bees). Animals that are vectors of hemorrhagic infectious disease (eg, mosquitos, ticks) were excluded. Results Our review of the literature indicates that changes to climatic norms will have a potentially dramatic effect on terrestrial venomous creatures. Empirical evidence demonstrates that geographic distributions of many species have already shifted due to changing climatic conditions. Given that most terrestrial venomous species are ectotherms closely tied to ambient temperature, and that climate change is shifting temperature zones away from the equator, further significant distribution and population changes should be anticipated. For those species able to migrate to match the changing temperatures, new geographical locations may open. For those species with limited distribution capabilities, the rate of climate change may accelerate faster than species can adapt, causing population declines. Specifically, poisonous snakes and spiders will likely maintain their population numbers but will shift their geographic distribution to traditionally temperate zones more often inhabited by humans. Fire ants and Africanized honey bees are expected to have an expanded range distribution due to predicted warming trends. Human encounters with these types of creatures are likely to increase, resulting in potential human morbidity and mortality.

"24",115,"Climate change and <i>Ixodes</i> tick-borne diseases of humans","Ostfeld, R. S.; Brunner, J. L.","The evidence that climate warming is changing the distribution of Ixodes ticks and the pathogens they transmit is reviewed and evaluated. The primary approaches are either phenomenological, which typically assume that climate alone limits current and future distributions, or mechanistic, asking which tick-demographic parameters are affected by specific abiotic conditions. Both approaches have promise but are severely limited when applied separately. For instance, phenomenological approaches (e.g. climate envelope models) often select abiotic variables arbitrarily and produce results that can be hard to interpret biologically. On the other hand, although laboratory studies demonstrate strict temperature and humidity thresholds for tick survival, these limits rarely apply to field situations. Similarly, no studies address the influence of abiotic conditions on more than a few life stages, transitions or demographic processes, preventing comprehensive assessments. Nevertheless, despite their divergent approaches, both mechanistic and phenomenological models suggest dramatic range expansions of Ixodes ticks and tick-borne disease as the climate warms. The predicted distributions, however, vary strongly with the models' assumptions, which are rarely tested against reasonable alternatives. These inconsistencies, limited data about key tick-demographic and climatic processes and only limited incorporation of non-climatic processes have weakened the application of this rich area of research to public health policy or actions. We urge further investigation of the influence of climate on vertebrate hosts and tick-borne pathogen dynamics. In addition, testing model assumptions and mechanisms in a range of natural contexts and comparing their relative importance as competing models in a rigorous statistical framework will significantly advance our understanding of how climate change will alter the distribution, dynamics and risk of tick-borne disease.",2015,"APR 5","PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","370","1665","","WOS:000350829800011","10.1098/rstb.2014.0051","","#9153","Ostfeld 2015","","Biotic; Perspective paper; Potentially relevant; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

A.","Nesting populations of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the Atlantic and western Indian Oceans are increasing or stable while those in the Pacific are declining. It has been suggested that leatherbacks in the eastern Pacific may be resource limited due to environmental variability derived from the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), but this has yet to be tested. Here we explored bottom-up forcing and the responding reproductive output of nesting leatherbacks worldwide. We achieved this through an extensive review of leatherback nesting and migration data and by analyzing the spatial, temporal, and quantitative nature of resources as indicated by net primary production at post-nesting female migration and foraging areas. Leatherbacks in the eastern Pacific were the smallest in body size and had the lowest reproductive output due to less productive and inconsistent resources within their migration and foraging areas. This derived from natural interannual and multidecadal climate variability together with an influence of anthropogenic climate warming that is possibly affecting these natural cycles. The reproductive output of leatherbacks in the Atlantic and western Indian Oceans was nearly twice that of turtles in the eastern Pacific. The inconsistent nature of the Pacific Ocean may also render western Pacific leatherbacks susceptible to a more variable reproductive output; however, it appears that egg harvesting on nesting beaches is their major threat. We suggest that the eastern Pacific leatherback population is more sensitive to anthropogenic mortality due to recruitment rates that are lower and more variable, thus accounting for much of the population differences compared to Atlantic and western Indian turtles.",2008,"MAY","Ecology","89","5","1414-1427","WOS:000256101200023","10.1890/07-0364.1","","#10536","Saba 2008","Dayo Osinubi (2024-08-28 07:33:37)(Select): Review of nesting populations of leatherback turtles, with some coverage of parts of North America.

"27",151,"Climate change and impacts of boreal forest insects","Volney, W. J. A.; Fleming, R. A.","The circum-polar boreal forest has played an important role in the wealth of northern nations since the 15th century. Its natural resources spurred strategic geopolitical developments beginning in the 16th century but intense development of the boreal forest is largely limited to the 20th century. Insects cause considerable loss of wood that has an adverse effect on the balance of carbon sequestered by forests. Current understanding of processes that lead to stand-replacing outbreaks in three insect species is reviewed in this paper. Many of these processes depend on climate either directly, such as reduced survival with extreme weather events, or indirectly, mainly through effects on the host trees. In the boreal zone of Canada, pest-caused timber losses may be as much as 1.3-2.0 times the mean annual depletions due to fires. Pests are thus major, but consistently overlooked forest ecosystem components that have manifold consequences to the structure and functions of future forests. Global change will have demonstrable changes in the frequency and intensity of pest outbreaks, particularly at the margins of host ranges. The consequent shunting of carbon back to the atmosphere rather than to sequestration in forests as biomass is thought to have positive feedback to global warming. Whereas significant progress has been made in developing carbon budget models for the boreal forests of Canada, enormous problems remain in incorporating pest effects in these models. These problems have their origins in the nature of interactions among pests with forest productivity, and problems with scaling. The common problems of verification and validation of model results are particularly troublesome in projecting future forest productivity. The interaction of insects with fires must be accounted for if realistic carbon sequestration forecasts in a warming climate are to be made, These problems make assessments of mitigation and adaptation of pest management alternatives difficult to evaluate at present. Nevertheless, the impacts of stand-replacing insect population outbreaks is important in formulating future resource management policy. Crown Copyright (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

While this review addresses both species loss and population declines, its emphasis is on the latter. Declines of abundant species can be especially worrisome, given that they anchor trophic interactions and shoulder many of the essential ecosystem services of their respective communities. A review of the factors believed to be responsible for observed collapses and those perceived to be especially threatening to insects form the core of this treatment. In addition to widely recognized threats to insect biodiversity, e.g., habitat destruction, agricultural intensification (including pesticide use), climate change, and invasive species, this assessment highlights a few less commonly considered factors such as atmospheric nitrification from the burning of fossil fuels and the effects of droughts and changing precipitation patterns. Because the geographic extent and magnitude of insect declines are largely unknown, there is an urgent need for monitoring efforts, especially across ecological gradients, which will help to identify important causal factors in declines.

Canada yew has a relatively unique growth form, with low sprawling branches capable of forming dense clusters of stems. Historic accounts suggest that before Euro-American settlement, Canada yew was a common plant across its range in many forest types and that it was locally abundant or dominant in 5%-20% of forest stands in the northern part of its range. Canada yew's range has declined during the last century as a result of browsing by native ungulates, fire, intensive forest management, and clearing of land for agriculture and other development. It is considered uncommon throughout most of its present North American range, except for often isolated populations in areas that remain free from heavy browsing pressure by moose and deer (e.g., islands, areas with heavy snow cover, or areas naturally low in ungulate abundance). Its decline has likely resulted in changes to abiotic and biotic conditions, including structure and composition of understory vegetation and concomitant effects on understory vertebrates.

This mosquito, similar to other Stegomyia species such as Aedes aegypti (L.), is highly adapted to urban and suburban areas, and commonly oviposits in artificial containers, which are ubiquitous in these peridomestic environments. The increase in speed and amount of international travel and commerce, coupled with global climate change, have aided in the resurgence and expansion of Stegomyia species into new areas of North America. In many parts of their range, both species are implicated as significant vectors of emerging and re-emerging arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and now Zika. Although rapid and major advances have been made in the field of biology, ecology, genetics, taxonomy, and virology, relatively little has changed in the field of mosquito control in recent decades. This is particularly discouraging in regards to container-inhabiting mosquitoes, because traditional integrated mosquito management (IMM) approaches have not been effective against these species. Many mosquito control programs simply do not possess the man-power or necessary financial resources needed to suppress Ae. albopictus effectively. Therefore, control of mosquito larvae, which is the foundation of IMM approaches, is exceptionally difficult over large areas. This review paper addresses larval habitats, use of geographic information systems for habitat preference detection, door-to-door control efforts, source reduction, direct application of larvicides, biological control agents, area-wide low-volume application of larvicides, hot spot treatments, autodissemination stations, public education, adult traps, attractive-toxic sugar bait methods, lethal ovitraps, barrier-residual adulticides, hand-held ultra-low-volume adulticides, area-wide adulticides applied by ground or air, and genetic control methods. The review concludes with future recommendations for practitioners, researchers, private industry, and policy makers.

We present a conceptual framework using one system as a model, emphasizing interactions across levels of biological hierarchy and spatiotemporal scales. Bark beetles are major natural disturbance agents in western North American forests. However, recent bark beetle population eruptions have exceeded the frequencies, impacts, and ranges documented during the previous 125 years. Extensive host abundance and susceptibility, concentrated beetle density, favorable weather, optimal symbiotic associations, and escape from natural enemies must occur jointly for beetles to surpass a series of thresholds and exert widespread disturbance. Opposing feedbacks determine qualitatively distinct outcomes at junctures at the biochemical through landscape levels. Eruptions occur when key thresholds are surpassed, prior constraints cease to exert influence, and positive feedbacks amplify across scales. These dynamics are bidirectional, as landscape features influence how lower-scale processes are amplified or buffered. Climate change and reduced habitat heterogeneity increase the likelihood that key thresholds will be exceeded, and may cause fundamental regime shifts. Systems in which endogenous feedbacks can dominate after external forces foster the initial breach of thresholds appear particularly sensitive to anthropogenic perturbations.",2008,"/","BioScience.","","","501-517","","10.1641/B580607","IND44071925","#15461","Raffa 2008","Anabel Kinsey (2024-09-04 09:19:50)(Select): I couldn't find a specific temporal example of a flow, but I think this has a lot of potential!

We compiled E. fabae arrival dates and infestation severity data at different states in USA from existing literature reviews and agricultural extension records from 1951-2012, and examined the influence of temperature anomalies at each target state or overwintering range on the date of arrival and severity of infestation.

E. fabae arrival has advanced by 10 days over the last 62 years. E. fabae arrived earlier in warmer years in relation to each target state level temperature anomaly (3.0 days/ degrees C increase in temperature anomaly). Increased temperature had a significant and positive effect on the severity of infestation, and arrival date had a marginal negative effect on severity.

Many of these diseases are no longer present, mainly because of changes in land use, agricultural methods, residential patterns, human behaviour, and vector control. However, diseases that may be transmitted to humans from wild birds or mammals (zoonoses; e.g. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and leptospirosis) continue to circulate in nature in many parts of the country. Most vector-borne diseases exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, which clearly suggests that they are weather sensitive. Rainfall, temperature, and other weather variables affect in many ways both the vectors and the pathogens they transmit. For example, high temperatures can increase or reduce survival rate, depending on the vector, its behaviour, ecology, and many other factors. Thus, the probability of transmission may or may not be increased by higher temperatures. The tremendous growth in international travel increases the risk of importation of vector-borne diseases, some of which can be transmitted locally under suitable circumstances at the right time of the year.

Presently, Arctic fulmars face threats from harvest, bycatch in fisheries, and fouling in oil spills while the birds are in their winter range (the North Atlantic). However, during breeding, migration, and overwintering, they may also experience stress from ecotourism, contaminants, particulate garbage, and climate change.

It is unclear how polar-adapted arthropods will respond to such changes, though many are expected to be at great risk of extinction. Here, we review the adaptive mechanisms that allow polar arthropods to persist in extreme environments and discuss how the effects of climate change at the poles will likely favour non-native species or those with the ability to rapidly evolve and/or acclimate. We find that physiological, behavioural, plastic, and genetic data are limited in scope for polar arthropods and research on adaptive responses to change is scarce. This restricts our ability to predict how they may respond to a warming climate.

A key question is how these changes will alter the provision of ecosystem services from the ocean, particularly from fisheries. To answer this question, we need to understand not only the ecological dynamics of marine systems, but also human adaptation and feedbacks between humans and the rest of the natural world. In this review, we outline what we have learned from research primarily in continental shelf ecosystems and fishing communities of North America. Key findings are that marine animals are highly sensitive to warming and are responding quickly to changes in water temperature, and that such changes are often happening faster than similar processes on land. Changes in species distributions and productivity are having substantial impacts on fisheries, including through changing catch compositions and longer distances traveled for fishing trips. Conflicts over access to fisheries have also emerged as species distributions are no longer aligned with regulations or catch allocations. These changes in the coupled natural-human system have reduced the value of ecosystem services from some fisheries and risk doing so even more in the future. Going forward, substantial opportunities for more effective fisheries management and operations, marine conservation, and marine spatial planning are likely possible through greater consideration of climate information over time-scales from years to decades.",2020,"","Special Feature: Marine ecosystem services: Ecological, socioeconomic and cultural sustainability.","63","1","17-26","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1438-390X.12050","","#22124","Pinsky 2020","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

"42",238,"Forest ecosystems of temperate climatic regions: from ancient use to climate change","Gilliam, Frank S"," 871I.I. IntroductionForest ecosystems have always been an integral part of human existence, whether as a source of food, fiber, and habitat, as an essential component in maintaining the atmospheric balance of O2 and CO2, or as a source of musical, artistic, or poetic inspiration.Gilliam I chose to begin my book on the ecology of herbaceous communities of forests of eastern North America with this statement for both personal and professional reasons. I suspect that many, if not most, people who have had direct contact with forests eventually grow to establish an intimate connection with them, and at a variety of levels. It was such a personal intimacy that led to my scientific study of them. As this is a Tansley review, it is an appropriate aside to note that Sir Arthur Tansley himself conveyed a special sense of awe regarding forests, more specifically the Kingley Vale in his native England (Fig. ), which offered a view that Tansley considered 'the finest in England,' a place that held both spiritual and professional significance for him, first as an 11-yr-old boy and later as an international leader in the field of plant ecology (Ayres, ).Although humans have long utilized resources associated with all forest biomes - tropical, subtropical, temperate and boreal - I suggest that it is the expanse of human populations in the temperate region that has left the most indelible anthropogenic signature among forested regions. Certainly, deforestation in the tropics has been, and continues to be, a serious environmental concern, for example, with projected loss of forest cover being up to 40% for the Amazon Basin by 2050 (Soares-Fihlo et al., ), and a global annual loss rate of 0.4% (Hansen et al., ; Malhi et al., ). However, a far greater relative fraction of the original extent of temperate forests of the eastern United States has at one time been harvested, with estimates of < 1% of these original forests remaining as primary (old-growth) forests (Davis, ). Older examples of anthropogenic alteration are wide-spread in Central Europe, where forest conversion dates back to the Neolithic Period (EEA, ). Dambrine et al.  found evidence for 2000-yr-old ecological legacies created by temperate forest conversion and subsequent agricultural practices by the Romans in central France. Older still is the human imprint left on temperate forests of China, wherein extensive forest alteration dates back some 6000 yr before present (BP), to such an extent that the roles of climate and anthropogenic disturbance are essentially confounded in understanding long-term patterns of change in vegetation (Liu, ). Thus, if there is a common theme across the global distribution of temperate forests, it is that the human imprint on them is indelibly large and deep, and more so than with any other forest biome type.The term 'global change' is a collective term to describe anthropogenic modification of all aspects of the global environment that has the potential to alter the sustainability of the Earth for life. Often erroneously used interchangeably with anthropogenic climate change (hereafter, simply 'climate change'), global change comprises not only climate change, but also other essential facets of environmental change that interact with climate change, including land use, modification of local and regional hydrological cycles, changes in biogeochemical cycles, and biodiversity loss (Vitousek, ; Steffen et al., ; Franklin et al., ). Clearly, global change is not only quite evident in all temperate forests of the world, but also it has long been so.Indeed, there is an ancient legacy of human alteration of landscapes of temperate forests on a global scale. In North America, notable evidence suggests that, far before the arrival of Europeans, use of fire by Native American peoples greatly impacted the composition of eastern hardwood forests, especially regarding tree species of masting or fruiting value, either directly for food or indirectly for game forage (Kay & Simmons, ). Even the English landscape that was so dear to Tansley (e.g. the Kingley Vale panorama; Fig. ) was anything but pristine wilderness, given widespread deforestation of the English landscape by Romans 2000 yr BP (Williams, ). These observations challenge the very notion of what truly constitutes a primary or pristine state. Further, global change should never be considered a solely recent, modern phenomenon.New terminology has recently been developed to address this awareness. Ellis et al.  quantified anthropogenic change of global biomes (anthromes). Even our current epoch - the Holocene - is increasingly being referred to as the Anthropocene considering wide temporal and spatial scales of human alteration of all facets of the biosphere, from domestication of animal species and conversion of vast areas of land for cultivation, to long-term changes in atmospheric chemistry (Steffen et al., ; Ellis, ; Lewis & Maslin, ).Ellis  conceptualized how humans, more than any other multicellular organism, have transformed Earth's ecosystems, including temperate forests, leading to what he calls anthroecology theory. Figure  provides a visual representation of this theory for a temperate woodland. Beginning with earliest human inhabitation of the Earth, human populations have not only expanded in number, but have also changed socio-culturally, from hunter-gatherer, to horticultural, eventually to our current industrial status. The result has been chronic anthropogenic change in land use and cover, patterns of energy consumption, ecosystem properties (e.g. carbon flux and nutrient cycling) and ecosystem state (from 'wild' to 'novel' to 'used') (Fig. ). This provides a conceptual framework for this review, as it links ancient use of temperate forests to current patterns of climate change.The purpose of this review is to bring into focus the diverse forests of the temperate region of the biosphere, with particular emphasis on crucial challenges for the future of temperate forests. Although these are generally found between 20° and 60° in each of the north and south latitudes, because land mass distribution of the biosphere is decidedly asymmetrical (more land occurring north of the equator) and due to a variety of climatic, oceanographic, and orographic factors, temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere lack the widespread nature of their northern counterparts. Consequently, somewhat more emphasis will be placed on temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere.871II.II. A brief biogeography and history of temperate forestsIn North America, temperate forests span most of the eastern United States as hardwoods of widely varying species dominance, with conifer and mixed (conifer/hardwood) forests occurring in parts of the southeast, west and, especially, the Pacific Northwest, from the coastal United States into Canada. Temperate forests dominate essentially all of England and northern Europe, with a narrow band reaching far into Russia, much of eastern China and virtually all of Japan (Fig. ). Distributions of temperate forests are more restricted in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere, including southern Chile, southeastern Australia and all of Tasmania, and parts of New Zealand, including all of the North Island, where it is referred to as oceanic temperate forest (McGlone et al., ). Temperate conifers tend to dominate in more extreme conditions (e.g. cold climates and/or infertile soils) (Reich & Frelich, ; Waring, ), or in fire-dominated regions (e.g. the southeastern Coastal Plain and western regions of the USA), although conifer dominance in other regions (e.g. North American Pacific Northwest) has been ascribed to unusually long photosynthetic seasons arising from mild winters with abundant rainfall (Givnish, ) (Fig. ).The predominant climate of most of these forest regions is one of distinct cyclic, seasonal changes involving periods of growth and dormancy. Specific temporal patterns of seasonal change, however, display impressive variability among temperate forest regions, a function of latitude (longer growing seasons toward at lower latitudes), topographic features (e.g. mountains) and proximity to oceans with marine currents of varying prevailing temperatures. The latter is evidenced by the development of temperate rainforests associated with coastal main lands or islands, including the Pacific coast of North America and small areas of Great Britain and Japan, and throughout most of southern Chile, southeastern Australia and southern New Zealand (Alaback, ).Geological history and soil formation also vary greatly among temperate forests, thus precluding broad generalizations (Bally & Palmer, ; Ponge et al., ). In North America the geological (continental) structure is generally symmetrical, beginning with the middle outward including shield, interior lowlands, mountains, coastal plains, continental shelves and ocean basins. By contrast, Eurasia lacks such symmetry, with Europe being geologically separated from Asia by the Ural Mountains (King, ). Thus, the broad spatial patterns of soil formation in North America contrast sharply with those for Asia (Bally & Palmer, ; Ponge et al., ; King, ).One aspect of geological history shared among temperate forests is the profound effects of glaciation (Clark et al., ). Most relevant is the occurrence of the last glacial maximum (LGM), a period of widespread surface ice that ended c. 20 000 yr bp (Yokoyama et al., ). Given the extent of LGM glaciers (Fig. a,b), any exposition of temperate forests necessitates at least a perfunctory understanding of their widespread nature. Glaciations of the LGM even have a diverse nomenclature, based on global location (Ehlers & Gibbard, ). Prominent in the Northern Hemisphere were the Wisconsin glaciation in North America and the Devensian,Wurm and Weichselian glaciations in the British Isles, Alps and Northern/Central Europe, respectively. In the Southern Hemisphere, LGM glaciers include the Llanquihue and Otira glaciations in Chile and New Zealand, respectively.Despite their widespread occurrence, temperate forests of many regions are similar in development toward their present state. Most of the Northern Hemisphere was once dominated by the Arcto-Tertiary geoflora (Cain, ; Axelrod, ; Whittaker, ). This was a time (c. 15 Myr BP) of a far warmer global climate than the present one, which was especially pronounced toward polar areas. Within this expansive forest were numerous gymnosperm genera, such as Cedrus,Picea,Pinus and Tsuga, and angiosperm genera - Acer,Betula,Carya,Corylus,Castanea,Fagus,Magnolia,Quercus,Tilia,Ulmus and Liquidambar (Xiang et al., ; Graham, ). Increased warming during the Tertiary yielded to the cooler Quaternary, leading to the massive glaciers of the LGM over much of what is now boreal forest throughout the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. a). This pushed many species south toward the unglaciated refugia (e.g. Appalachian Mountains), which may have provided sources of remigration of species toward their current distributions (Davis, ; Graham, ; Stebich et al., ).Interestingly, the LGM is essentially irrelevant for temperate forests of China, largely unaffected by Quaternary glaciation (Liu, ). Pollen records reveal a diverse assemblage of tree genera at this time, varying from mixed conifer-hardwood to deciduous to widespread subtropical broadleaved evergreen forests; hardwoods comprised genera similar to other temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere, with a diverse oak (Quercus) flora (Liu, ). Stratigraphy of mid-Holocene pollen demonstrates a period of maximum warmth (i.e. the Hypsithermal). Throughout northern regions at this time, forests increased in diversity with thermophilous hardwoods expanding, replacing both pine and, toward the south, birch (Liu, ).Although glaciation also occurred in the Southern Hemisphere, other processes were equally significant in determining its temperate forest tree flora, including higher sea-to-land ratios creating conditions leading to temperate rain forests on west-facing coasts (Alaback, ) and species of Nothofagus and conifers of the families Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae (Beard, ; Kershaw & Wagstaff, ). During the Tertiary Period, drying occurred in continental regions, selecting more xeromorphic and even pyrophilic, fire-tolerant genera, such as Eucalyptus (Beard, ).Fire - typically more prevalent among conifer-dominated stands than hardwood-dominated stands - has long been an integral factor in directing the development of temperate forest ecosystems. Marlon et al.  used the paleorecord to examine the relationship between abrupt changes in global climate and enhanced frequency of fire. Using data from 35 charcoal/pollen records in North America to assess change in fire regimes during the past 15-10 kyr (the latest glacial-interglacial transition, and a time of profound climate change), they found clear links between fire frequency and degree of climate change. Implicit in their evidence is the intimate connection between occurrence of fire and the development of drought conditions in forested regions.874III.III. Climate, soils, composition and land use1. North AmericaTemperate forests of North America occur in the eastern United States primarily as hardwood forests (except for extreme high elevations and southeastern Coastal Plain pinelands) and as conifer and mixed forests in parts of the western United States and Canada. Using the Köppen-Geiger climate classification (Kottek et al., ), the predominant eastern climate would be classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) to the south, and humid continental (Dfa) to the north; prevailing climates for western forests are predominantly warm temperate (Csb), with boreal zone-like conditions (Dfc) at high elevations of central western USA. Winter climate is dominated by fluctuations between cold, dry arctic air, along with cyclonic storms with marine-derived moisture to produce occasional heavy snows. Winter temperatures vary from means of -5°C in the north to 10°C toward the south. Spring brings thunderstorm activity through mixing of cold polar air with moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. Mean summer temperatures throughout the region range from 20° to 27°C. Frost-free periods are generally between 120 and 150 d in the north to > 250 d in the south. Mean annual precipitation is 80-140 cm (Archibold, ). The prevailing climate of the Pacific Northwest forests is largely maritime, varying with latitude and elevation, with precipitation increasing with elevation (Franklin & Halpern, ).Soils of eastern forests are generally Alfisols, Inceptisols and Ultisols, glaciated towards the north (Fig. a). Unglaciated soils are old, with soil pH decreasing with age. Soils of western forests are spatially variable. Montane conifer forest soils are usually young, derived from granites, gneisses and schists (Peet, ). Pacific Northwest conifer forest soils comprise Ultisols, Inceptisols and Spodosols, with many soils of volcanic origin (Franklin & Halpern, ).With the exception of the virtual elimination of the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) by the chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) beginning in 1904, current eastern temperate forest types are largely similar to those originally described by Braun . With the highest tree diversity occurring in the mixed mesophytic forest region of the Appalachians, dominant genera include oaks (Quercus spp.), maples (Acer spp.), hickories (Carya spp.) and birch (Betula spp.), along with American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera).Conifer forests vary greatly within the broad temperate region of North America. At the higher elevations throughout the Appalachian mountain range (800-1200 m above sea level (asl) in New England to 1600 m asl in the Great Smoky Mountains), spruce (Abies spp.) and fir (Picea spp.) forests are common (Vankat, ). Southeastern Coastal Plain conifer forests are predominantly pines (Pinus spp.) of a primarily successional nature, the result of frequent natural (e.g. fire) and anthropogenic (e.g. harvesting) disturbances (Platt et al., ); these typically change through secondary succession to Quercus-Carya forests (Peet et al., ). Before European settlement c. 250 yr bp, this region was dominated by a single species - Pinus palustris - which is currently < 3% of its original distribution (Gilliam & Platt, ).Montane conifer forests of western North America contain more genera than those of the eastern United States. Important genera include fir (Abies spp.), juniper (Juniperus spp.), spruce (Picea spp.), pine (Pinus spp.), hemlock (Tsuga spp.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Some of these form mixed forests, especially those associated with elevation gradients and successional status following disturbances, such as fire; hardwoods include maple (Acer spp.), alder (Alnus spp.), poplar (Populus spp.) and mountain ash (Sorbus spp.) (Peet, ). The mild, moist climate of Pacific Northwest (coastal forests west of the Cascade crest) selects for a complex assortment of conifer species, including Pseudotsuga menziesii,Tsuga spp., Abies spp., Pinus spp. and several genera of cedars (family Cupressaceae, e.g. Calocedrus,Chamaecyparis,Thuja), including the awe-inspiring redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), the tallest tree in the world (Franklin & Halpern, ).2. EuropeThe European Environment Agency divides Europe into 11 biogeographical regions, based on prevailing climate and proximity to bodies of water (EEA, ). Regions most germane to this discussion are the Atlantic, Black Sea, Continental and Pannonian, with Continental occupying by far the largest area (Finnie et al., ). Temperate forests here are predominantly hardwood species, with conifer forests increasing in importance toward the north and with increasing elevation. These extend farther east into western Russia, wherein climate becomes increasingly continental and drier, contrasting with the maritime climate toward the west. The climate throughout this area ranges from temperate oceanic (Do) in the west to temperate continental (Dc) eastward (Kottek et al., ). Winter temperatures vary from maritime means of 3° to 5°C to continental means of -4° to -15°C in central Russia. Mean summer temperatures generally range from 22° to 30°C. Mean annual precipitation is 50-75 cm, with snow uncommon in lowland parts of Europe (Archibold, ).Many of the soils of Europe often are referred to collectively as brown earths, which are similar to North American Alfisols, except that many are developed from calcareous parent materials wherein they are more similar to Inceptisols. Other common soils are Spodosols, especially in northern latitudes (Jones et al., ).Human alteration of temperate forests over recent millennia is perhaps most pronounced here (Mitchell & Cole, ; Niklasson et al., ), where only c. 25% of forests are considered primary (sensu FAO, : 'forest of native species where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes have not been significantly disturbed'), something that disconnects forest distribution with climate (Allen et al., ). Evidence suggests that anthropogenic disturbance began there in the Neolithic, with widespread forest conversion beginning c. 7000 yr BP (EEA, ). Since these ancient times, forest condition has been closely linked with human populations and socio-economic development. Both historical and paleo-ecological records indicate periods not only of increased logging, but also of land abandonment and forest regrowth, including the plague years of the 1300s (EEA, ).There are generally fewer tree species in Europe than in North America, a contrast further exacerbated by extensive planting of conifer species throughout hardwood ranges (Augusto et al., ). Despite this, the two regions share many deciduous genera, including Quercus,Acer,Betula,Ulmus and Fagus (Pages & Michalet, ; Ellenberg, ). EEA  recognizes a mesophytic deciduous forest type, quite analogous to that which dominates the eastern United States. Analogous to chestnut blight in eastern USA, European species of Ulmus, especially white elm (U. laevis), have been decimated by the Dutch elm disease (Ophiostoma ulmi), which has also decimated elm species of North America (Peterken, ).The current extent of European temperate conifer forests is greatly modified by past and current policies to plant vast areas of productive conifer species. Again, widespread native deciduous forests have been replaced by conifer plantations, modifying the general composition of the western European temperate forest. Although some of these were transplanted from within Europe (e.g. Norway spruce, Picea abies and Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris), others were imported from North America (e.g. Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis and Douglas fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii) (Augusto et al., ). Not surprisingly, then, as with hardwood genera, predominant European conifer genera overlap greatly with those of North America, including Abies,Picea and Pinus (EEA, ).3. AsiaSimilar to their North American counterparts, temperate forests of Asia occur primarily as hardwood forests throughout the eastern part of the continent, extending to and including virtually the entire island of Japan, except for extremes of elevation and north latitude, where there are well-developed boreal conifer forests (Aiba, ), resulting from similar climates between the two regions, primarily humid subtropical and temperate continental, Cf and Dc, respectively (Kottek et al., ). The most profound difference in climate between these regions is the existence of a monsoon season widespread in parts of Asia, arising from drastic pressure changes over the continent, that is, Monsoon Asia (Nakashizuka & Iida, ). Consequently, precipitation in Monsoon Asia has a pronounced summer maximum, with up to 90% falling between May and September. The wettest areas are on the Korean peninsula. Mean winter temperatures range from c. 3°C to -15°C in southern coastal and northern interior regions, respectively. Spring is dominated by moist tropical maritime air, with July temperatures averaging from 22°C to 28°C (Archibold, ).Soils of Asian temperate forests are analogous to those of North American temperate forests. These vary from Alfisols in upland regions to Ultisols toward the south and east, with Entisols forming from alluvium along rivers. Spodosols develop in conifer-dominated regions associated with higher elevation and more northern latitudes (Archibold, ).Although the temperate deciduous forests of Asia are the most species-rich temperate forests in the world, many of them have been altered irreparably by land use, particularly in the lowland plains, which are virtually entirely cultivated (An et al., ). Many Asian tree taxa are quite common in North America (Ying, ; Nakashizuka & Iida, ; Fang et al., ), including Quercus,Ulmus,Tilia,Fraxinus,Acer and Lindera (Henbo et al., ; Takahashi, ), and close relatives such as Asian Castanopsis and Distylium (Miura et al., ). Species vary greatly with elevation (Sang & Bai, ), with upland areas supporting species of Betula,Populus,Acer and Tilia;Salix,Betula and Populus are common in riparian areas (An et al., ). Forest type varies greatly with latitude; from north to south, this grades from mixed conifer to deciduous to mixed deciduous, then to widely distributed subtropical broadleaved evergreen forests (Liu, ).Asian conifers increase in importance with increasing elevation. Working in Chinese subalpine forests, Taylor et al.  reported extensive stands as mosaics of conifer (Abies,Larix,Sabina and Tsuga) and hardwood (Betula) patches. Other conifer genera include Picea and Pinus (Miyajima & Takahashi, ).4. Southern HemisphereBecause the distribution of land mass of the biosphere is decidedly asymmetrical, with far more land area being distributed north of the equator, temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere lack the expansiveness so characteristic of the Northern Hemisphere. These forests are confined to relatively narrow bands along western South America, southeastern Australia (including all of Tasmania) and northern New Zealand, including the northwestern half of South Island. Climatic, oceanographic and orographic factors further limit forest development in many areas of the Southern Hemisphere. These regions display very high ocean:land mass ratios; consequently, they are generally of maritime temperate climates (Cf). The Andes range exerts a profound influence on the prevailing climate of temperate-forest South America, with the windward side receiving a relatively constant flow of maritime air from the Pacific Ocean (Perakis & Hedin, ), and many are temperate rain forests (Beard, ). Mean annual temperatures are generally 6-10°C, with a range typically < 10°C. In coastal areas, July-to-January temperatures vary only by 4° or 5°C, with a similar pattern found for coastal southwestern New Zealand. Indeed, summers average c. 20°C, with winters ranging from 10-15°C. Precipitation for most of these sites is very high, exceeding 300 cm, reaching as much as 850 cm (Sturman & Tapper, ).Many of the soils throughout the temperate Southern Hemisphere are highly weathered Spodosols, the result of high amounts of rainfall and its associated fluctuating water table. These soils are generally highly acidic and infertile (Veblen et al., ; Grubb et al., ).Forest genera, and even plant families, of the temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere are quite dissimilar to those of the Northern Hemisphere. Prominent genera are Nothofagus (Nothofagaceae) and Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae), neither part of the native flora in the Northern Hemisphere. Conifer genera are in Araucariaceae (e.g. Araucaria) and Podocarpaceae (e.g. Podocarpus,Dacrydium) (Beard, ; Kershaw & Wagstaff, ). Forests of Chile and Argentina vary sensitively along the Andes-induced climatic gradient. Nothofagus species are dominant throughout these forests (Veblen et al., ; Armesto et al., ), but with Araucaria araucana replacing Nothofagus species under more stressful environmental conditions (Sanguinetti & Kitzberger, ). Mainland forests of Australia are dominated by Eucalyptus and Acacia species, especially in drier areas, whereas Nothofagus species, along with gymnosperms, are found in the cool, moist forests of Tasmania. Nothofagus is common in New Zealand, covering 84% and 40% of the South and North Islands, respectively (Beard, ). The current status of many forests of the Southern Hemisphere represents considerably altered states of the primary conditions, for example, the rainforests of Chile before the Conquest of Chile in the mid-16th Century by Spain (Smith-Ramírez, ).875IV.IV. Climate changeHumans have, indeed, long utilized temperate forests for a variety of purposes (Fig. ). Currently, temperate forests are managed worldwide for timber production, driven by an ever-increasing demand and resulting from relatively rapid growth among overstory dominant species, but also from the versatility of temperate tree species for numerous uses (e.g. paper, construction materials, furniture). Management practices potentially affect these forests across all spatial scales, from the landscape (Rhemtulla et al., ), to the overstory (Beaudet et al., ), and, often most sensitive, the herb layer (Moola & Vasseur, ; von Oheimb & Härdtle, ; Gilliam, ; Hedwall & Brunet, ). Furthermore, management practices historically often have been carried out using methods that are unsustainable in terms of maintaining forest ecosystem structure and function, including plantation forestry, especially conversion from slower-growing hardwood forests to faster-growing conifer plantations (Seidl et al., ), and forest fragmentation (Smith-Ramírez, ). Naudts et al.  suggested that broadscale conversion of temperate European hardwoods to conifer plantations contributes measurably to what is perhaps the most profound modern human influence on these forests - climate change (Lindner et al., ; Parks & Bernier, ).Thus, I suggest the following as the 'bookends' of anthropogenic impacts on temperate forests. The first is their historic - even ancient - and chronic use/conversion by ever-increasing human populations; the second is climate change. The spatial and temporal dimensions of these are superimposed (Fig. ). The legacy effects of the recent and distant past are currently on a trajectory of future dynamics operating under the overriding influence of climate change (Dale et al., ), and all that is associated with it, including altered phenology of organisms (Parmesan & Yohe, ) and extremes of weather-related phenomena (Min et al., ) (Fig. ). All responses of temperate forests to current land-use pressures must be viewed forever through the lens of climate change (Fig. ).In this final section, I emphasize challenges for future sustainability of global temperate forests. This is not meant to represent an exhaustive list of all critical issues. Rather, I emphasize those for which sufficient work has been done to provide an understanding of the nature of the problem. These include the effects of atmospheric deposition of excess N, global change-mediated alterations in phenology of temperate forest species and increases in drought/fire.1. Excess nitrogenMore pronounced in the Northern than the Southern Hemisphere, a major human perturbation of temperate forests worldwide has arisen from emissions of reactive nitrogen (Nr) into the atmosphere leading to chronically elevated deposition of Nr and a cascade of environmental stresses for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and human health (Galloway et al., ). The N comprising 78% of the atmosphere - N2 - is considered nonreactive N because it enters into essentially no photochemical transformations in the atmosphere and no metabolic pathways in organisms, other than N fixation by a small group of symbiotic and nonsymbiotic prokaryotes. However, numerous forms of Nr exist, including NH3, NH4+, NO, NO2, NO3-, 2N2O5, HNO3 and several forms of peroxyacetyl nitrates (Horii et al., ), all capable of undergoing photochemical transformations in the atmosphere and entering terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.Although more research on the effects of excess N has focused on herb-dominated than on forested ecosystems (Clark et al., ; Simkin et al., ), increasingly work is being devoted to understanding such effects on forest ecosystems, including those of the temperate regions (Sutton et al., ). Whereas current increases in N deposition are occurring on a global scale (Bobbink et al., ), N-mediated threats to biodiversity are particularly pronounced for temperate forests, especially given the spatial coincidence of high human population density - and associated N pollution - with temperate forests (Holland & Lamarque, ), the disproportionate contribution of the herbaceous layer to temperate forest diversity (Gilliam, ), and the sensitivity of the forest herb community to excess N (Gilliam, ). More vexing still is that chronically elevated N deposition is occurring contemporaneously and, indeed, interactively with climate change (Maes et al., ).Essentially all initial work on effects of excess N deposition on terrestrial ecosystems examined biogeochemical responses. These studies focused on changes in stream chemistry, generally showing increases in NO3- (from enhanced nitrification and leaching) and base cations (Ca++, Mg++ and K+) coupled with the movement of NO3- (Aber, ). Many areas of temperate forests of North America, especially those of the eastern United States, were shown to be sensitive to N saturation, a phenomenon which develops as atmospheric and microbial supply of available N exceeds biotic demand. Recent work has emphasized the effects of excess N on biodiversity of temperate forests (Thomas et al., ; Clark et al., ; Simkin et al., ). Despite considerable inter-site variability, a broad consensus is that excess N decreases forest biodiversity in temperate forests of North America.Gilliam  provided a conceptual model to describe interactive processes that are sensitive to increased N loading in ways that can lead to loss of herb layer diversity, including altering interspecific competition, increasing herbivory and pathogenic fungal infection, inhibiting mycorrhizal associations and enhancing species invasions. Nitrogen-mediated declines in biodiversity are typically seen as loss of species in the herb layer from the increased cover of fewer nitrophilic species at the expense of numerous N-efficient species (Gilliam et al., ). Fewer studies have focused on responses of tree species to N. Thomas et al.  modelled the potential effects of N on temperate forest C sequestration and tree seedling survivorship. Chronically elevated N deposition enhanced C storage, but decreased survivorship in 8 of 11 common temperate tree species. Following N saturation, C sequestration is typically limited by another nutrient (Leuzinger & Hättenschwiler, ), often phosphorus (Gress et al., ).Research focusing on chronically elevated N deposition leading to N saturation began in Europe much earlier than in North America, primarily because N-related threats appeared earlier and were far more widespread there (Gilliam, ). Although a notable amount of European work has been in the boreal region and in herb-dominated ecosystems, most recent work has been carried out in temperate forested regions, with much of that concerned with the response of the typically species-rich herbaceous layer to excess N, largely based on broad regional synthesis studies (De Schrijver et al., ; Verheyen et al., ; Dirnböck et al., ; Ferretti et al., ).Borrowing a phrase from my home state of West Virginia, where coal mining is common, many N-effects studies in Europe use the forest herb layer community as 'the canary in a coal mine' (wherein caged canaries were once placed in a coal mine, whose death served as an early indication of impending peril for coal miners from coal gas). The wide spatial extent of sampling employed by these studies adds considerable validity and credibility to their findings. Verheyen et al.  compiled data from 1205 permanent/semi-permanent sample plots among 23 carefully selected understory resurvey studies. Utilizing a wide gradient in N deposition across deciduous temperate forests in Europe, they assessed the importance of factors influencing forest herb communities, including rate of N deposition, change in density of large herbivores, and change in forest canopy cover and composition. Their results demonstrated the interactive nature of these factors, concluding that N-mediated increases in nitrophilous species can be obscured by changes in the forest overstory. Similarly, Dirnböck et al.  synthesized long-term monitoring data from 1335 permanent samples among 28 forested sites from northern Fennoscandia to southern Italy, noting temporal trends in herb-layer species cover and diversity. They found a pattern of gradual replacement of N-efficient species by nitrophilous species in response to N deposition that was consistent on the European scale. Hedwall & Brunet  attempted to separate effects of global change and altered land-use in both boreal and temperate forests of Sweden by documenting temporal variation in herb layer species over a 20-yr period in both boreal and temperate forests of Sweden, finding that most species changed in overall frequency. Comparing functional traits of both increasing and declining species, they found that current floristic dynamics were caused by combined effects of climate warming, nitrogen deposition and changing land-use (e.g. plantation forestry). Herb species' changes were more pronounced in temperate, rather than boreal, forests.Less is known regarding the effects of excess N on temperate forests of Asia (Liu et al., ) and the Southern Hemisphere. In China, this arises because of the chronically highly dissected extent of temperate forests (Liu, ) and the spatial distribution of highest amounts of N deposition occurring in tropical/sub-tropical regions (Lu et al., ). In addition to elevated rates of N emissions to the atmosphere (Liu et al., ), much of China's problems with excess N is associated with over-use of N fertilizers for summer maize agriculture (Zhang et al., ). Kim et al.  concluded that increases in N availability throughout Korea and Japan was most likely due to deposition of pollutant N from atmospheric sources from both industrial and agricultural regions. Perakis & Hedin  found that, as a result of their location relative to oceans, with prevailing winds coming off those oceans, forests of the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere receive some of the lowest annual rates of N deposition anywhere in the world (Godoy et al., ).2. Altered phenologyGiven that a prominent feature of all temperate forests is their distinct seasonality, phenology - seasonally recurring events of an organism's life cycle, for example, flowering, emergence of invertebrates, movement of migratory animals, and especially their timing and relationship with the physical environment - plays a key role in the structure and function of temperate forest ecosystems. For plants, phenological changes can be triggered by environmental cues, for example, chilling, spring temperature, growing degree days and daylight (Elmendorf et al., ). Because of their lack of thermoregulation, ectothermic animals (e.g. insects) can resemble plants with respect to environmental influences on and control of phenology, particularly temperature. Changes in phenology can affect several processes essential to survival, growth and reproduction of all organisms, especially critical when complex interspecific interactions are involved, such as plant-pollinator dynamics.Many plant species are classified phenologically, based on seasonal patterns of flowering via photoperiod. Long-day plants flower in spring as day length increases, whereas short-day plants flower from late summer into the fall as day length decreases. Actually, it is the length of uninterrupted darkness that controls flowering, such that long-day plants are more accurately short-night plants and vice versa. Despite this importance of photoperiod, thermoperiod - daily and seasonal patterns of change in temperature - also affects virtually all phenologically controlled plant processes. Anecdotally, gardeners rue days of atypically warm temperatures in late winter that allow flower and leaf buds to break dormancy, only to be followed by seasonal temperatures < 0°C that kill new, susceptible tissues.Evidence indicates that climate change has altered growing seasons in the temperate regions worldwide. Based on global meta-analyses of > 1700 wild species, including woody and herbaceous plants, birds, insects, amphibians and fish, Parmesan & Yohe  found widespread changes in phenology and species distributions attributable to climate warming. Despite some species' temporal stability, most exhibited change as predicted by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They found advancing spring events of 2.3 d/decade, and shifting biogeographical ranges toward the poles of 6.1 km per decade (Parmesan & Yohe, ), calling such changes a 'coherent fingerprint' of the overall effect of climate change on natural systems.Ibáñez et al.  observed that climate warming has altered both spring and autumn phenologies of many species, but found considerable interspecific variation and, for a given species, spatial variation in response to climate change. Forecasting future change, they used a long-term (1953-2005) dataset including spring and autumn plant phenological events (flowering/leaf out and leaf coloring/leaf fall, respectively) of tree, shrub and herbaceous species of temperate forests of South Korea and Japan, finding that most species currently exhibit advanced spring phenology and delayed autumn phenology, consistent with expectations, but also that autumn-based changes are more rapid than those associated with spring. The latter observation contrasts with comparable studies in Europe which show that spring events are changing more rapidly than autumn events (Menzel et al., ).For temperate forests, three relevant factors affecting the phenology of dominant tree species are photoperiod, degree of winter chilling and temperature (Körner & Basler, ). There is, however, interspecific variability in which predominant factor(s) control phenology among temperate forest species, with photoperiod increasing in importance with forest succession; that is, it is more important for long-lived, late-successional species than for short-lived, early-successional species. Although this may mitigate warming-induced change in temperate forest composition, Körner & Basler suggested that opportunistic (e.g. exotic invasive) species may benefit from a warming climate and claim a competitive advantage over photoperiod-sensitive species (Körner & Basler, ).Altered phenology is a driver of change not only for plant species, but also for animal species, creating a complex scenario for plant-animal interactions, particularly pollination. Less a problem for climax canopy hardwood species, which are almost exclusively wind-pollinated, this is irrelevant for temperate conifers, but an especially serious threat for forest herbaceous species. Potts et al.  reviewed patterns of global declines in numerous pollinator species, with an understandable focus on insects - especially bees - considering that they are the primary pollinators of both agricultural crops and wild species. Potential drivers of pollinator loss include habitat loss/fragmentation, agrochemicals, pathogens and introductions of novel species. Also included is climate change, and interactions among virtually all drivers. Effects of climate change on insect pollinators are seen on all hierarchical levels of organization, from the individual to population and community levels. Especially troublesome are the temporal and spatial mismatches between plant species and their insect pollinators, arising temporally from changes in phenology of plant and insect species, and spatially from altered distributions (Potts et al., ).Climate change-altered phenology has extended into changing life cycles among insects, an example of which is the mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae), native to western North America, and a generalist pest for the genus Pinus, often erupting epidemically, and killing wide swathes of trees throughout the region (Fig. a). Mitton & Ferrenberg  studied a recent epidemic of MPB that was an order of magnitude larger than ever recorded and extending to higher elevations/latitudes than on record. They demonstrated that, following 20 yr of increasing air temperatures in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the flight season of MPB began > 1 month earlier than historically known and extended twice that duration. More important was their novel finding that the life cycle of some broods of MPB increased from one to two generations per year (Fig. b). They explained that because this species lacks a diapause (suspension in development), its development is controlled solely by temperature. Accordingly, MPB populations currently respond to climate warming via faster development and expanse into previously inhospitable environments (Mitton & Ferrenberg, ). This work, however, was challenged by Bentz & Powell , who agreed that MPB is influenced by climate change, but stated that such studies need to consider thermally dependent traits that have evolved to maintain seasonality.Climate change interactions have been reported for other forest pest insects. DeRose et al.  combined empirical data, based on US Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis data, with three global change models to evaluate and predict the effect of increasing temperature on the distribution of spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis), which attacks spruce forests of North America. They predicted that extent of attack should increase with temperature, but that there should be time lag in response, given the long-lived nature of host spruce trees.This phenomenon is not confined to North America. Netherer & Schopf  reported similar findings from throughout Europe for defoliating insects, bark beetles and especially the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa), a defoliating insect for numerous conifer species. Its altitudinal and latitudinal distributions are controlled primarily by temperature and are already modified by climate change. Because of the prevailing oceanic climate in the Southern Hemisphere (i.e. generally lower temperatures during the growing season), climate change is predicted to promote contrasting effects on insect cycles there, as well (Deutsch et al., ).Related to climate change-mitigated alterations in phenology are similarly altered changes in biogeographical ranges of species. Again, Parmesan & Yohe  concluded that climate change has caused mean pole-ward range shifts of 6.1 km per decade. Using seven global circulation models (GCMs), Hansen et al.  projected future distributions of prominent temperate forest types of North America, including the eastern deciduous forest and western mountain/coastal forests of the United States, focusing on major tree species. These models differ in their type - equilibrium vs transient - and in assumptions of change in temperature and precipitation. Equilibrium models are older and simulate instantaneous increases in CO2, being run until equilibrium climate conditions are reached; the more recent transient models assume increases in glasshouse gases at 1% yr-1 until 2100, allowing climatic adjustment. Although specific predicted outcomes for eastern forest species varied among models (Fig. ), all concurred in predicting profound shifts in dominant species, especially the virtual elimination the maple-beech-birch forest type (one of the more species-rich forest types of the region) and loblolly-shortleaf pine, and expansion of oak-hickory and oak-pine types (Fig. ). Potential ranges for several subalpine coniferous species are predicted to contract in the western United States (data not shown). Among their conclusions is that changes in climate and land use in the future will be of a magnitude to cause even greater changes in biodiversity. Although distributions of some species, communities and biomes are likely to expand, others will contract, creating novel communities (Hansen et al., ).3. Drought/fireIn their now-classic paper, Hansen et al.  provided forecasts of several outcomes of global climate change using the three-dimensional model of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. These included increased atmospheric warming globally, with degree of warming dependent on growth of trace gas emissions. Another prediction, one relevant for the present and future of global temperate forests, was a notable increase in the frequency of extremes of weather events and conditions. Indeed, this prediction is well-supported by current data collected by the Munchener Ruckversicherungs-Gesellschaft, Geo Risks Research, NatCatSERVICE, wherein they examined global annual frequency of catastrophic disturbances 1980-2014 (Fig. ). All types of catastrophic disturbance, save earthquakes, have increased during this period. These are true extremes, indeed, considering that frequencies of both flooding and drought exhibit large increases over the c. 35 yr time period. Relevant to the current discussion is the increased frequency of drought, a disturbance not directly associated with any particular biome, but representing an especially serious threat to temperate forests (Fig. ).Forests typically develop in the temperate zone wherever there is sufficient precipitation to maintain soil moisture amounts capable of supporting tree growth and survival. Thus, the occurrence of extensive drought will have directly damaging effects on tree species. In addition to the direct limitations of drought-induced moisture stress, however, is the drought-induced increase in the frequency of fire. Wildfire activity has not only been predicted to increase in the future under a climate warming scenario, but also such increases are hypothesized to bring about biogeographical shifts that reduce the resilience of fire-prone forests worldwide (Harvey et al., ). Although the relative contribution of fire to forest decline is greatest in the boreal forest, fire still represents a threat to temperate forests, especially conifer forests already weakened by drought (Hansen et al., ). Harvey et al.  tested two hypotheses associated with this observation in fire-prone subalpine (largely conifer) forests in the Rocky Mountains of the United States: (1) availability of viable seeds will decrease in large patches following stand-replacing fire, and (2) seedling establishment and survival will decline measurably following post-fire drought. They found that total tree seedling establishment declined sharply post-fire with greater drought severity and with greater distance to seed source. Many responses exhibited interspecific variation, suggesting fire/drought-induced changes in forest composition. They concluded that, given the predicted increase in frequency of drought and wildfire in the future, post-fire tree seedling establishment of these forests could be reduced substantially. Although some of these reductions might be offset by compensatory increases from lower montane and upper timberline species, important near- to mid-term shifts in the composition and structure of high-elevation forests will occur under continued climate warming and increased wildfire activity.Not part of their study, yet no less important, is the interaction of drought and fire with increases in extent and severity of forests pests, as discussed in Mitton & Ferrenberg  in North America and Netherer & Schopf  in Europe. That is, the scene depicted in Fig. (a) of wide swathes of insect-killed stems is of trees more susceptible to insect death because of drought stress, and simultaneously represents substantial fuel for intense fires. Furthermore, McDowell et al.  established a close connection between climate change-enhanced drought and increases in pests for temperate forests of North America.878V.V. EpilogueRegrettably, climate change has been insinuated into the current political arena - especially in the United States, but also elsewhere around the world - wherein agenda-driven politics seek to deny its scientific reality (I remind my students that mixing politics and science is like mixing manure and ice cream - it never helps the manure, but always ruins the ice cream). In spite of this, and to a real degree because of it, climate change will continue to threaten global ecosystems in general, and temperate forests in particular, for many years in the future. It is quite compelling that, in spite of misrepresentations to the contrary, numerous long-term predictions from the past regarding climate change have largely survived scientific scrutiny. Certainly, predictions of Hansen et al.  nearly 30 yr ago have all been essentially supported, especially regarding climate change-mediated extremes of weather (Fig. ).Climate change, however, is only a part, albeit the lion's share, of global change, comprising myriad other drivers, most of which have been exposited herein. Franklin et al.  developed a conceptual model of the effects of these drivers - climate change, altered disturbance regimes, invasive species/novel species assemblages, land-use change - on terrestrial ecosystems using multiple lines of evidence. These include observations for attribution, experiments for identifying mechanisms, and use of models at multiple scales of ecological organization for verification (Fig. ). Although this model was developed as a set of general guidelines for all ecosystems of the biosphere, it seems particularly applicable to temperate forests, considering (1) the chronic alteration of these forests by human populations, and (2) their temperate nature, wherein growing/dormant seasons are an integral part of their structure and function. Such a model provides a strong base not only for ongoing scientific inquiry and understanding, but also in informing mitigation policy. Although the science to date has provided sufficient evidence providing the impetus for policy changes, there is still a clear need for further basic scientific research. Climate change is unquestionably a complex phenomenon that can be best understood only by a complex of scientific approaches, involving empirical field monitoring, manipulative field experiments and laboratory simulations, all coupled with modeling (e.g. DeRose et al., ).Finally, I suspect that I am not alone among plant ecologists in considering Sir Arthur Tansley as a professional 'hero,' a truly inspirational visionary in our field, and one who clearly articulated many ecological concepts we embrace today. Although it is an honor to write a review bearing his name, I cannot imagine that he, in his day, would have conceived the truly global scale of our 'modern' alteration of climate. Still, he deeply appreciated the profoundly negative influence human activity can have on the very ecosystems that he not only 'coined,' but on which our sustainability depends. Appropriately, I allow Sir Arthur to conclude:It would be difficult, not to say impossible, to draw a natural line between the activities of the human tribes which presumably fitted into and formed parts of 'biotic communities' and the destructive human activities of the modern world...Regarded as an exceptionally powerful biotic factor which increasingly upsets the equilibrium of preexisting ecosystems and eventually destroys them, at the same time forming new ones of very different nature, human activity finds its proper place in ecology.

The purpose of this review is to bring into focus the diverse forests of the temperate region of the biosphere, including those of hardwood, conifer and mixed dominance, with a particular emphasis on crucial challenges for the future of these forested areas. Implicit in the term 'temperate' is that the predominant climate of these forest regions has distinct cyclic, seasonal changes involving periods of growth and dormancy. The specific temporal patterns of seasonal change, however, display an impressive variability among temperate forest regions. In addition to the more apparent current anthropogenic disturbances of temperate forests, such as forest management and conversion to agriculture, human alteration of temperate forests is actually an ancient phenomenon, going as far back as 7000 yr before present (bp). As deep-seated as these past legacies are for temperate forests, all current and future perturbations, including timber harvesting, excess nitrogen deposition, altered species' phenologies, and increasing frequency of drought and fire, must be viewed through the lens of climate change.",2016,"12-01","New Phytologist (Online)","212","4","871","","https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14255","","#25030","Gilliam 2016","Laura  Dee (2024-08-23 01:43:09)(Select): New Phytologist isnt a book; Anna LoPresti (2024-07-16 08:46:33)(Screen): are we including books?;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

To investigate the risks and benefits of AM, old provenance trials have been repurposed and new common-garden experiments initiated. In this paper, we review three decades of common-garden based research into the adaptation of species and provenances (geographically specific varieties) to current and future climates in North America. Using a filtered data base of 106 papers and reports, we investigate multiple aspects of this work, including subject species, tree response variables and their climatic predictors, statistical techniques, and the patterns of adaptation revealed in results. Although the reviewed work contained valuable insights into provenance-climate relationships, much of this work focused on growth in commercial conifer species and the correlation of that growth with annual or monthly climatic averages. A minority of studies investigated the effects of climate variables with direct mechanistic effects on growth or phenology, including temperature extremes, frost and drought indices, or growing-season duration. Furthermore, recent research has opened new avenues of investigation into the influence of local soil and topographic variables, and even ectomycorrhizal communities over provenance performance. We make the case that future common-garden research into provenance-climate relationships should focus on climatic variables with demonstrated mechanistic connections to growth, survival, and phenology.

Biodiversity across all levels of biological classifications is fundamentally based on genetic diversity. However, the integration of genomics and phylogenetics into conservation management may not be as rapid as climate change. The genetics of hybrid introgression as a source of novel variation for ecological divergence and evolutionary speciation (and resilience) may generate adaptive potential and diversity fast enough to respond to locally-altered environmental conditions. Major plant and herbivore hybrid zones with associated communities deserve conservation consideration.

"45",250,"Impacts of climate warming on hybrid zone movement: Geographically diffuse and biologically porous aspecies bordersa","Scriber, JMark","Abstract The ecology and evolutionary biology of insect-plant associations has realized extensive attention, especially during the past 60 years. The classifications (categorical designations) of continuous variation in biodiversity, ranging from global patterns (e.g., latitudinal gradients in species richness/diversity and degree of herbivore feeding specialization) to localized insect-plant associations that span the biospectrum from polyphenisms, polymorphisms, biotypes, demes, host races, to cryptic species, remain academically contentious. Semantic and biosystematic (taxonomical) disagreements sometimes detract from more important ecological and evolutionary processes that drive diversification, the dynamics of gene flow and local extinctions. This review addresses several aspects of insect specialization, host-associated divergence and ecological (including """"""""hybrid"""""""") speciation, with special reference to the climate warming impacts on species borders of hybridizing swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae). Interspecific hybrid introgression may result in collapse of multi-species communities or increase species numbers via homoploid hybrid speciation. We may see diverging, merging, or emerging genotypes across hybrid zones, all part of the ongoing processes of evolution. Molecular analyses of genetic mosaics and genomic dynamics with """"""""divergence hitchhiking"""""""", combined with ecological, ethological and physiological studies of """"""""species porosity"""""""", have already begun to unveil some answers for some important ecological/evolutionary questions. (i) How rapidly can host-associated divergence lead to new species (and why doesn't it always do so, e.g., resulting in """"""""incomplete"""""""" speciation)? (ii) How might """"""""speciation genes"""""""" function, and how/where would we find them? (iii) Can oscillations from specialists to generalists and back to specialists help explain global diversity in herbivorous insects? (iv) How could recombinant interspecific hybridization lead to divergence and speciation? From ancient phytochemically defined angiosperm affiliations to recent and very local geographical mosaics, the Papilionidae (swallowtail butterflies) have provided a model for enhanced understanding of ecological patterns and evolutionary processes, including host-associated genetic divergence, genomic mosaics, genetic hitchhiking and sex-linked speciation genes. Apparent homoploid hybrid speciation in Papilio appears to have been catalyzed by climate warming-induced interspecific introgression of some, but not all, species diagnostic traits, reflecting strong divergent selection (discordant), especially on the Z (= X) chromosome. Reproductive isolation of these novel recombinant hybrid genotypes appears to be accomplished via a delayed post-diapause emergence or temporal isolation, and is perhaps aided by the thermal landscape. Changing thermal landscapes appear to have created (and may destroy) novel recombinant hybrid genotypes and hybrid species.",2011,"04-01","Insect Science","18","2","121-159","","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7917.2010.01367.x","","#27059","Scriber 2011","Grace Westphal (2024-08-16 03:57:42)(Select): Transboundary discussion is limited to US and Canada (mentioned only once), but the ideas in here about range limits / traits based on climates seems broadly useful; ","Biotic; Transboundary unclear; save for other sections",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

Although many of these studies have shown that animal resource subsidies can have significant effects on nutrient cycling, ecosystem productivity, and food-web structure, there is a great deal of variability in the occurrence and strength of these effects. Here we propose a conceptual framework for understanding the context dependency of animal resource subsidies, and for developing and testing predictions about the effects of animal subsidies over space and time. We propose a general framework, in which abiotic characteristics and animal vector characteristics from the donor ecosystem interact to determine the quantity, quality, timing, and duration (QQTD) of an animal input. The animal input is translated through the lens of recipient ecosystem characteristics, which include both abiotic and consumer characteristics, to yield the QQTD of the subsidy. The translated subsidy influences recipient ecosystem dynamics through effects on both trophic structure and ecosystem function, which may both influence the recipient ecosystem's response to further inputs and feed back to influence the donor ecosystem. We present a review of research on animal resource subsidies across ecosystem boundaries, placed within the context of this framework, and we discuss how the QQTD of resource subsidies can influence trophic structure and ecosystem function in recipient ecosystems. We explore the importance of understanding context dependency of animal resource subsidies in increasingly altered ecosystems, in which the characteristics of both animal vectors and donor and recipient ecosystems may be changing rapidly. Finally, we make recommendations for future research on animal resource subsidies, and resource subsidies in general, that will increase our understanding and predictive capacity about their ecosystem effects.",2019,"04-01","Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society","94","2","517-538","","https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12465","","#28864","Subalusky 2019","Laura  Dee (2024-10-18 08:31:27)(Select): GREAT background for the chapter, agree not very specific to North America but the framework and types of biotic flows are relevant; Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-17 12:48:57)(Select): There is not enough specific examples to be useful for transboundary.

Our attempts to understand the cause-and-effect linkages between observed ecosystem changes and various stressors are evolving. Non-indigenous species, pollutants, land-use and climate change that can alter a lake's physical and chemical environment can manifest rapid changes in community composition and abundance of phytoplankton. As such, for many decades researchers have used phytoplankton data from Lake Erie to track environmental changes. We provide a chronological account of previous and ongoing assessments of pelagic algae to summarize past and present environmental conditions of Lake Erie. This review necessarily focuses on diatom-based assessments as their preserved remains in sediments have been used to hind-cast human-induced impacts and recovery. Because of their uniqueness, this review summarizes where possible the long-term trends according to the western, central and eastern lake basins. Overall, this historical assessment summarizes a period of significant eutrophication throughout most of the 20th century, followed by water quality improvement due to nutrient reductions and establishment of filter-feeding dreissenids. Recent data suggest new issues associated with blooms of diatoms and blue-green algae. The challenges facing Lake Erie underline the need for continued monitoring and evaluation of historical records that will help us distinguish natural from anthropogenic changes, and to reveal the causes and extent of environmental insults in order to make management decisions.

Here, we reviewed primary introduction events to each ecoregion of the marine Arctic realm to identify temporal and spatial patterns, likely source regions of NIS, and the putative introduction pathways. We included 54 introduction events representing 34 unique NIS. The rate of NIS discovery ranged from zero to four species per year between 1960 and 2015. The Iceland Shelf had the greatest number of introduction events (n = 14), followed by the Barents Sea (n = 11), and the Norwegian Sea (n = 11). Sixteen of the 54 introduction records had no known origins. The majority of those with known source regions were attributed to the Northeast Atlantic and the Northwest Pacific, 19 and 14 records, respectively. Some introduction events were attributed to multiple possible pathways. For these introductions, vessels transferred the greatest number of aquatic NIS (39%) to the Arctic, followed by natural spread (30%) and aquaculture activities (25%). Similar trends were found for introductions attributed to a single pathway. The phyla Arthropoda and Ochrophyta had the highest number of recorded introduction events, with 19 and 12 records, respectively. Recommendations including vector management, horizon scanning, early detection, rapid response, and a pan-Arctic biodiversity inventory are considered in this paper. Our study provides a comprehensive record of primary introductions of NIS for marine environments in the circumpolar Arctic and identifies knowledge gaps and opportunities for NIS research and management.

Enhancement, commercial fishery closures, and angling restrictions have failed to halt the decline. Human impacts such as dams, pollution or marine overexploitation were responsible for some stock declines in the past, but adult returns to river and hatchery stocks with no obvious local impacts have also declined or collapsed since 1985. Multiple studies have postulated that the recent widespread occurrence of low adult returns may be caused by climate change, salmon farming, food availability at sea, or marine predators but these possibilities are unsupported by stocks that persist near historic levels, loss of stocks remote from farm sites, a diverse marine prey field, and scarcity of large offshore predators. The decline and collapse of stocks has common characteristics: 1) cyclic annual adult returns cease, 2) annual adult returns flatline, 3) adult mean size declines, and 4) stock collapses occurred earliest among watersheds distant from the North Atlantic Sub-polar Gyre (NASpG). Cyclic annual adult returns were common to all stocks in the past that were not impacted by anthropogenic changes to their natal streams. A flatline of adult abundance and reduction in adult mean size are common characteristics of many overexploited fish stocks and suggest illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fisheries exploitation at sea. Distance from the NASpG causing higher mortality of migrating post-smolts would increase the potential for collapse of these stocks from IUU exploitation. By-catch of post-smolts and adults in paired-trawl fisheries off Europe and intercept adult fisheries off Greenland, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and off Europe have been sources of marine mortality but seem unlikely to be the primary cause of the decline. Distribution in time and space of former, legal high-sea fisheries indicated fishers were well acquainted with the ocean migratory pattern of salmon and combined with lack of surveillance since 1985 outside Exclusive Economic Zones or in remote northern regions may mean high at-sea mortality occurs because of IUU fisheries. The problem of IUU ocean fisheries is acute, has collapsed numerous stocks of desired species worldwide, and is probably linked to the decline and impending collapse of the North Atlantic salmon population.",2022,"MAR 16","REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE & AQUACULTURE","30","2","215-258","WOS:000668774600001","10.1080/23308249.2021.1937044","","#2660","Dadswell 2022","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-30 12:40:25)(Select): Review paper indicates that climate change is not responsible for collapse of salmon fisheries """"In our opinion climate change

Understanding both the current distribution as well as biogeographic patterns is important for restoration planning. We used United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data to quantify the current density and distribution of C. dentata. We then review the literature concerning biogeographic patterns in C. dentata. Currently, 431 +/- 30.2 million stems remain. The vast majority (360 +/- 22 million) are sprouts <2.5 cm dbh. Although this number is approximately 10% of the estimated pre-blight population, blight has caused a major shift in the size structure. The current-day population has a larger range, particularly west and north, likely due to human translocation. While climate change could facilitate northward expansion, limited seed reproduction makes this unlikely without assisted migration. Previous research demonstrates that the current, smaller population contains slightly higher genetic diversity than expected, although little information exists on biogeographic patterns in the genetics of adaptive traits.

An assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on biological control is critical but challenging, because biological control depends on inter-wspecific interactions, which are generally complex. This chapter considers the potential effects of projected climate change on the biological control of insect pests, focusing on North American agricultural systems but involving principles that apply globally. The drivers of importance are projected rising surface temperatures, increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations and changes in the amount of and variability in precipitation. We consider how these climate change drivers could affect biological control by: (i) directly affecting the physiology or behaviour of biological control agents and/or pests; (ii) changing the overlap between species in space and time; and (iii) modifying interactions among multiple species involved in biological control within the agroecosystem. We illustrate with the few North American documented examples of the sensitivity of biological control to climate change, or with data that indicate such sensitivities exist. Effects of the first type include increases in the occurrence of temperatures that exceed the thermal optima of natural enemies, such as those that have been documented for coccinellids. Effects of the second type include changes in phenological overlap between insect pests and their natural enemies, illustrated best by a recent report involving the cereal leaf beetle and its principal parasitoid. Effects of the third type include climate-related changes in plant responses to herbivory that influence natural enemies, to the effects of climate on interacting predator assemblages and food webs. Although there is evidence for each of these types of effects, the literature remains sparse.

However, our understanding of arctic coastal ecosystems remains limited, and the impacts of ongoing and future climate change on them are largely unexplored. Kelp forests are the dominant habitat along many rocky Arctic coastlines, providing structure and food for economically and ecologically important species. Here we synthesize existing information on the distribution and diversity of arctic kelp forests and assess how ongoing changes in environmental conditions could impact the extent, productivity, and resilience of these important ecosystems. We identify regions where the range and growth of arctic kelp are likely to undergo rapid short-term increase due to reduced sea ice cover, increased light, and warming. However, we also describe areas where kelps could be negatively impacted by rising freshwater input and coastal erosion due to receding sea ice and melting permafrost. In some regions, arctic kelp forests have undergone sudden regime shifts due to altered ecological interactions or changing environmental conditions. Key knowledge gaps for arctic kelp forests include measures of extent and diversity of kelp communities (especially northern Canada and northeastern Russia), the faunal communities supported by many of these habitats, and the role of arctic kelp forests in structuring nearby pelagic and benthic food webs.

At the cusp of this developing field of study, we review the theoretical and practical advances in four primary areas of plant macrophenology: (1) global patterns and shifts in plant phenology, (2) within-species changes in phenology as they mediate species' range limits and invasions at the regional scale, (3) broad-scale variation in phenology among species leading to ecological mismatches, and (4) interactions between phenology and global ecosystem processes.

Climate is a major factor in determining: (1) the geographic and temporal distribution of arthropods; (2) characteristics of arthropod life cycles; (3) dispersal patterns of associated arboviruses; (4) the evolution of arboviruses; and (5) the efficiency with which they are transmitted from arthropods to vertebrate hosts. Thus, under the influence of increasing temperatures and rainfall through warming of the oceans, and alteration of the natural cycles that stabilise climate, one is inevitably drawn to the conclusion that arboviruses will continue to emerge in new regions. For example, we cannot ignore the unexpected but successful establishment of chikungunya fever in northern Itaty, the sudden appearance of West Nile virus in North America, the increasing frequency of Rift Valley fever epidemics in the Arabian Peninsula, and very recently, the emergence of Btuetongue virus in northern Europe. In this brief review we ask the question, are these diseases emerging because of climate change or do other factors play an equal or even more important rote in their emergence?

"55",NA,"Analysis of Invasive Insects: Links to Climate Change","Gutierrez, A. P.; Ponti, L.","Climate change is expected to alter the geographic distribution and abundance of many species, to increase the invasion of new areas by exotic species and, in some cases, to lead to species extinction. This chapter reviews some of the links between invasive insects and climate change. The effects of climate change on insect pest populations can be direct, through impacts on their physiology and behaviour, or indirect, through biotic interactions (i.e. bottom-up and top-down effects). Anthropogenic climate and global change is expected to be a major driver in the introduction, establishment, distribution, impact and changes in the efficacy of mitigation strategies for invasive species. To address these problems, we must be able to predict climate change impacts on species distribution and abundance. Commonly used ecological niche model ling approaches have implicit assumptions about the biology of the target species and attempt to characterize the ecological niche using aggregate weather and other factors in the area of recorded distribution. More holistic physiologically based demographic modelling approaches explicitly describe the biological and physiological responses of species to weather and the species they interact with on fine temporal and spatial scales. The geographic distribution and relative abundance of four invasive insect pests are reviewed under observed and +2 degrees C weather scenarios across the USA and Mexico: the tropical New World screwworm, the pink bollworm, the Mediterranean fruit fly (i.e. medfly) and the olive fly. The distribution of the olive fly is examined across the Mediterranean basin to illustrate the transferability of the model to analyses of new regions and climate change scenarios.",2014,"","Invasive species and global climate change","4","","45-61","WOS:000355559800005","10.1079/9781780641645.0000","","#4679","Gutierrez 2014","Anna LoPresti (2024-08-27 05:29:22)(Select): this is a book chapter;","Biotic",NA,FALSE,TRUE,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE

A.","Synopsis Desert riparian ecosystems of North America are hotspots of biodiversity that support many sensitive species, and are in a region experiencing some of the highest rates of climatic alteration in North America. Fremont cottonwood, Populus fremontii, is a foundation tree species of this critical habitat, but it is threatened by global warming and regional drying, and by a non-native tree/shrub, Tamarix spp., all of which can disrupt the mutualism between P. fremontii and its beneficial mycorrhizal fungal communities. Specialist herbivorous leaf beetles (Diorhabda spp.) introduced for biocontrol of Tamarix are altering the relationship between this shrub and its environment. Repeated episodic feeding on Tamarix foliage by Diorhabda results in varying rates of dieback and mortality, depending on genetic variation in allocation of resources, growing conditions, and phenological synchrony between herbivore and host plant. In this article, we review the complex interaction between climatic change and species introductions and their combined impacts on P. fremontii and their associated communities. We anticipate that (1) certain genotypes of P. fremontii will respond more favorably to the presence of Tamarix and to climatic change due to varying selection pressures to cope with competition and stress; (2) the ongoing evolution of Diorhabda's life cycle timing will continue to facilitate its expansion in North America, and will over time enhance herbivore impact to Tamarix; (3) defoliation by Diorhabda will reduce the negative impact of Tamarix on P. fremontii associations with mycorrhizal fungi; and (4) spatial variability in climate and climatic change will modify the capacity for Tamarix to survive episodic defoliation by Diorhabda, thereby altering the relationship between Tamarix and P. fremontii, and its associated mycorrhizal fungal communities. Given the complex biotic/abiotic interactions outlined in this review, conservation biologists and riparian ecosystem managers should strive to identify and conserve the phenotypic traits that underpin tolerance and resistance to stressors such as climate change and species invasion. Such efforts will greatly enhance conservation restoration efficacy for protecting P. fremontii forests and their associated communities.",2015,"OCT","Integrative and Comparative Biology","55","4","587-601","WOS:000362672100004","10.1093/icb/icv019","","#5395","Hultine 2015","","Biotic",NA,FALSE,TRUE,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE

We then conducted a meta-analysis using species-specific model estimates to ask if life-history traits explained variation in which barriers were most important in species' past response to climate change.ResultsOur findings reveal heterogeneity in both where North American mammal phylogeography has been studied and the density of genetic breaks across 229 species. We found relatively high concordance among carnivores, ungulates and lagomorphs, where breaks were associated with mountains, major water bodies and relatively even terrain. In contrast, we found high variability within rodents and shrews, and no evidence that intrinsic factors related to dispersal ability explained the importance of hypothesized barriers across all species.Main ConclusionsSouthern Mexico is a hotspot for genetic breaks that has yet to be integrated into the broader story of North American phylogeography. We show that mountains and major water bodies play particularly important roles as barriers, but substantial variation across species within orders suggests that there is more to the story besides shared climatic or phylogenetic histories. Thus, understanding the phylogeography of individual species will continue to be important given that our results suggest high variability in how species may respond to future global change.",2024,"2024 JUN 6","Global Ecology and Biogeography","","","","WOS:001239162000001","10.1111/geb.13875","","#5704","Jensen 2024","","Biotic",NA,FALSE,TRUE,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE

A warming climate will have large effects on lakes of the Boreal Shield. Our ability to forecast these effects, however, is hampered by a very incomplete understanding of the actual interactions between weather and many aspects of lake ecosystems. Climate change will affect lakes in very complex ways. Changing weather conditions will have direct effects on thermal habitats; however, there will also be very important indirect effects on lake ecosystems through influences on watershed processes that affect the thermal and chemical characteristics of lakes. Altered habitat conditions will affect the resident biota in both positive and negative ways and may favour range expansions of some native and non-native species. Our understanding of the altered biological interactions that will structure lake communities in a warmer climate is still limited, making the prediction of biological outcomes very difficult. Modelling efforts, experiments and empirical analyses of relationships between important attributes of lakes, lake communities, and weather conditions in the past are beginning to further our ability to predict likely future effects. Much more work is needed in all these research areas to further our understanding of the probable effects of climate change on Boreal Shield lakes.

We reviewed research on effects of changes in temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and ocean currents on pelagic life stages, post-settlement life stages, and reproduction of four species in the New England groundfish fishery: Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), and yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea). The volume of research on cod was nearly equal to that on the other three species combined. Similarly, many more studies examined effects of temperature than other factors. The majority of studies suggest adverse outcomes, with less evidence for mixed or positive effects. However, for all of the factors other than temperature, there are more knowledge gaps than known effects.

Rapid expansion and deleterious ecosystem effects have motivated extensive research on this species; here this research is synthesized. Maps of the global distribution are provided and the invasion history of N. melanostomus, which spread more rapidly at first in North America, but has undergone substantial expansion over the past decade in the Baltic Sea, is summarized. Meta-analyses comparing their size at age, diet, competitors and predators in North American and European ecosystems are provided. Size at age is region specific, with saline habitats typically supporting larger and faster growing individuals than fresh water. Neogobius melanostomus prey differs substantially between regions, demonstrating a capacity to adapt to locally abundant food sources. Neogobius melanostomus comprise at least 50% of the diet of eight taxa in at least one site or life stage; in total, 16 predator taxa are documented from the Laurentian Great Lakes v. five from Eurasia. Invasive N. melanostomus are the only common forage fish to heavily exploit mussels in the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea, facilitating the transfer of energy from mussels to higher trophic levels in both systems. Neogobius melanostomus morphology, life history, reproduction, habitat preferences, environmental tolerances, parasites, environmental effects, sampling strategies and management are also discussed. Neogobius melanostomus inhabit a wide range of temperate freshwater and brackish-water ecosystems and will probably continue to spread via ballast water, accidental bait release and natural dispersal worldwide. Climate change will probably enhance N. melanostomus expansion by elevating water temperatures closer to its energetic optimum of 26 degrees C. Future research needs are presented; most pressing are evaluating the economic effects of N. melanostomus invasion, determining long-term population level effects of egg predation on game-fish recruitment and comparing several variables (density, ecological effects morphology and life history) among invaded ecosystems.

We drew on existing research and local knowledge to examine potential effects of climate change, petroleum development, tourism, and government spending cutbacks on the sustainability of four Arctic villages. We used data across eight disciplines to develop an Arctic Community Synthesis Model and a Web-based, interactive Possible Futures Model. Results suggested that climate warming will increase vegetation biomass within the herd's summer range. However, despite forage increasing, the herd was projected as likely to decline with a warming climate because of increased insect harassment in the summer and potentially greater winter snow depths. There was a strong negative correlation between hypothetical, development-induced displacement of cows and calves from utilized calving grounds and calf survival during June. The results suggested that climate warming coupled with petroleum development would cause a decline in caribou harvest by local communities.

Various studies have examined the potential effects of future climate change on sockeye salmon, but there is currently no synthesis of the documented effects of climate on this species. In this paper, we present a synthesis of 80 peer-reviewed publications in the English language evaluating the effects of climate on sockeye salmon growth, phenology, and survival. The great majority of studies examined have been conducted with stocks from North America (90 % of studies). Survival (55 %) has been the most frequently studied aspect of the sockeye salmon life history in relation to climate, followed by growth (45 %) and phenology (30 %), with temperature (83.4 %) being the climate-related variable most frequently examined in such studies. Across life stages, the effects of climate-related variables have been most frequently studied on fry (36.3 %) and least studied on spawners (7.5 %). Our synthesis revealed that associations between temperature and growth, phenology, or survival have been uncovered for all the life stages of sockeye salmon, whereas relationships with other climate-related variables have been sparse. There is substantial evidence that sockeye salmon are influenced by thermal conditions experienced at regional, rather than ocean- or continental-wide scales, and that responses to temperature vary among and within stocks. The mechanisms by which climate affect sockeye salmon during the early stages in freshwater and while at sea are still poorly understood and warrant future research. More research on the effects of non-temperature, climate-related variables (e.g. stream flow, ocean pH), inter-generational and carry-over effects of climate, interaction between climate and non-climate stressors, and adaptation to climate change are also needed.

The decline of amphibian populations as a result of the effect of this pathogen occurred simultaneously in various parts of the world from the early 1980's. In Mexico the epidemic wave of Bd was identified in the 1970's, which is consistent with the decline of salamander (caudate) populations in the southern part of the country. Our work presents a review of the state of knowledge of chytridiomycosis as a factor in the decline of amphibian populations worldwide and the information gathered until now of the presence of this pathogen in Mexico. To date, there has been infection in 50 Mexican amphibian species that are mainly distributed in the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico, and was determined that the families Hylidae and Plethodontidae are the most affected. Several authors have suggested that global climate change has played a key role in the occurrence and virulence of Batrachochytrium because the temperature increase induces an imbalance in the pathogen-host relationship to increased virulence of Bd and / or increased susceptibility to infection in amphibians. On this matter, we analyzed the reported temperatures of 1964-1989 in areas where the decline of caudates was more drastic. We found no relationship between the decline of salamanders with temperature.

G.","Emerging diseases are impacting animals under high-density culture, yet few studies assess their importance to wild populations. Microparasites selected for enhanced virulence in culture settings should be less successful maintaining infectivity in wild populations, as once the host dies, there are limited opportunities to infect new individuals. Instead, moderately virulent microparasites persisting for long periods across multiple environments are of greatest concern. Evolved resistance to endemic microparasites may reduce susceptibilities, but as barriers to microparasite distributions are weakened, and environments become more stressful, unexposed populations may be impacted and pathogenicity enhanced. We provide an overview of the evolutionary and ecological impacts of infectious diseases in wild salmon and suggest ways in which modern technologies can elucidate the microparasites of greatest potential import.

G.; Massa, M. L.; Cohen, E. B.","Birds must contend with an array of anthropogenic threats during their migratory journeys. Many migrants are killed due to encounters with artificial light, introduced species, pollutants, and other anthropogenic hazards, while survivors of these encounters can suffer longer-lasting negative effects. The nonlethal effects of anthropogenic threats on migrating birds are less well understood than direct mortality, yet both potentially contribute to population declines. For example, building collisions frequently kill migrating birds, but the numbers of migrants that survive with an impaired ability to fly, refuel, or navigate to their destination on time is not well understood. Though not immediately fatal, such injuries can lead to delayed mortality and, ultimately, reduced lifetime reproductive success. Furthermore, migrants are likely to encounter multiple threats on their journeys, which can interact synergistically to further reduce fitness. For instance, light pollution attracts and disorients migrants, increasing the likelihood of window strikes, and surviving birds may be more vulnerable to predation from introduced predators. While considerable attention has focused on the lethal effects of anthropogenic threats, here, we review nonlethal effects of eight types of threats during migration, their interactions, and the pathways through which they can exert fitness costs. In doing so, we identify knowledge gaps and suggest areas for future research. In the absence of more information, we propose that the greatest reduction in the cumulative lethal and nonlethal impacts of anthropogenic hazards will be achieved by addressing threat types, like artificial light at night, that interact with and compound the impact of additional threats. Direct mortality from anthropogenic sources is recognized as a key driver of population declines, but a full understanding of the impacts of human activity on migrating birds must include the cumulative and interacting effects that extend beyond immediate mortality en route to influence overall migration success and lifetime fitness. Lay Summary & BULL; Migrating birds around the world face a wide variety of threats from human activity and many species are declining significantly. & BULL; Many migrants are killed by these threats, while those exposed but not immediately killed may experience changes in their condition, migration timing, orientation, or route. & BULL; Nonlethal effects of threats during migration, such as sensory pollutants and introduced species, have not been well-studied but are likely contributing to population declines by lowering future survival or reproduction. & BULL; We review support for the nonlethal impacts of eight anthropogenic threats, describe how they can cause nonlethal fitness costs for migrating birds, and identify knowledge gaps. & BULL; Reducing threats that compound the impacts of other threats, such as artificial light at night, will help to minimize the cumulative impacts on migratory birds. & BULL; Fully capturing the costs of human activity on migratory birds requires understanding both lethal and nonlethal impacts of encounters with anthropogenic threats during migration.",2023,"AUG 11","ORNITHOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","125","3","","WOS:001027469400001","10.1093/ornithapp/duad020","","#8801","Nemes 2023","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-11-22 07:04:41)(Select): study does not specifically focus on North America but could be relevant for understanding global climate change impacts on migratory bird populations ;","Biotic; Potentially relevant; Transboundary unclear; save for other sections",NA,FALSE,TRUE,NA,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE

In North America, decreases in the frequency and intensity of extreme winter cold events are expected to allow the poleward range expansion of many cold-sensitive tropical organisms, sometimes at the expense of temperate organisms. Although ecologists have long noted the critical ecological role of winter cold temperature extremes in tropical-temperate transition zones, the ecological effects of extreme cold events have been understudied, and the influence of warming winter temperatures has too often been left out of climate change vulnerability assessments. Here, we examine the influence of extreme cold events on the northward range limits of a diverse group of tropical organisms, including terrestrial plants, coastal wetland plants, coastal fishes, sea turtles, terrestrial reptiles, amphibians, manatees, and insects. For these organisms, extreme cold events can lead to major physiological damage or landscape-scale mass mortality. Conversely, the absence of extreme cold events can foster population growth, range expansion, and ecological regime shifts. We discuss the effects of warming winters on species and ecosystems in tropical-temperate transition zones. In the 21st century, climate change-induced decreases in the frequency and intensity of extreme cold events are expected to facilitate the poleward range expansion of many tropical species.

Global mean temperature could increase by 1.5-4.5 degrees C or more over historic levels, and extreme weather eventsdrought, storms, and floodingare likely to increase greatly in frequency. Although ecologists and foresters agree that the practice of forestry will be transformed under climate change, these uncertainties compound the challenge of achieving sustainable, adaptive forest management. In this aritcle, we (i) present a multidisciplinary synthesis of current knowledge of responses of temperate and boreal tree species and forest communities to climate change, and (ii) outline silvicultural strategies for adapting temperate and boreal forests to confront climate change. Our knowledge synthesis proceeds through critical appraisals of efforts to model future tree distributions and responses to climate change, and reviews physiological, phenological, acclimation, and epigenetic responses to climate. As is the case of climate change itself, there are numerous uncertainties about tree species and provenance responses to climate change. For example, acclimation of respiration and epigenetic conditioning of seed embryos has the potential to buffer species against limited warming. Provenances within species also display idiosyncratic responses to altered climates, implying that soemm varieties will be more resilient or resistant to climate change than others. Genetically determined limits to climatic tolerance, and the limits of tree community resistance and resilience (speed of recovery from disturbance) in the face of climate-related disturbances are largely unknown. These unknowns require managers to adopt a portfolio of silvicultural strategies, which may range from minor modifications of current practices to design of novel multi-species stands that may have no historical analogue. Forest managers must be prepared to respond nimbly as they develop, incorporate new insights about climate change and species responses to warming into their practices.

Lobatae) are a taxonomic group of hardwood trees, which occur in swamp forests, subtropical chaparral and savannahs from Columbia to Canada. They cover a wide range of ecological niches, and many species are thought to be able to cope with current trends in climate change. Genus Quercus encompasses ca. 500 species, of which ca. 80 make up sect. Lobatae. Species diversity is greatest within the southeastern USA and within the northern and eastern regions of Mexico. This review discusses the weak reproductive barriers between species of red oaks and the effects this has on speciation and niche range. Distribution and diversity have been shaped by drought adaptations common to the species of sect. Lobatae, which enable them to fill various xeric niches across the continent. Drought adaptive traits of this taxonomic group include deciduousness, deep tap roots, ring-porous xylem, regenerative stump sprouting, greater leaf thickness and smaller stomata. The complex interplay between these anatomical and morphological traits has given red oaks features of drought tolerance and avoidance. Here, we discuss physiological and genetic components of these adaptations to address how many species of sect. Lobatae reside within xeric sites and/or sustain normal metabolic function during drought. Although extensive drought adaptation appears to give sect. Lobatae a resilience to climate change, aging tree stands, oak life history traits and the current genetic structures place many red oak species at risk. Furthermore, oak decline, a complex interaction between abiotic and biotic agents, has severe effects on red oaks and is likely to accelerate species decline and fragmentation.

T.","Model systems in biology expand the research capacity of individuals and the community. Closely related to Arabidopsis, the genus Boechera has emerged as an important ecological model owing to the ability to integrate across molecular, functional, and eco-evolutionary approaches. Boechera species are broadly distributed in relatively undisturbed habitats predominantly in western North America and provide one of the few experimental systems for identification of ecologically important genes through genome-wide association studies and investigations of selection with plants in their native habitats. The ecologically, evolutionarily, and agriculturally important trait of apomixis (asexual reproduction via seeds) is common in the genus, and field experiments suggest that abiotic and biotic environments shape the evolution of sex. To date, population genetic studies have focused on the widespread species B. stricta, detailing population divergence and demographic history. Molecular and ecological studies show that balancing selection maintains genetic variation in similar to 10% of the genome, and ecological trade-offs contribute to complex trait variation for herbivore resistance, flowering phenology, and drought tolerance. Microbiome analyses have shown that host genotypes influence leaf and root microbiome composition, and the soil microbiome influences flowering phenology and natural selection. Furthermore, Boechera offers numerous opportunities for investigating biological responses to global change. In B. stricta, climate change has induced a shift of >2 weeks in the timing of first flowering since the 1970s, altered patterns of natural selection, generated maladaptation in previously locally-adapted populations, and disrupted life history trade-offs.

These losses are generally thought to occur because climate change is progressing too rapidly for populations to keep pace. Based on this hypothesis, numerous predictive frameworks have been developed to project future range shifts and changes in population dynamics resulting from global climate change. However, recent empirical work has demonstrated that seasonally asynchronous climate change regimes - when a region is warming during some parts of the year, but cooling in others - are constraining species' responses to climate change more strongly than rapid warming, leading to intra-specific variation in responses to climate change and local population declines. Here, we couple a review of the literature related to asynchronous climate change regimes with meta-population simulations and an analysis of long-term North American climate trends to show that seasonally asynchronous regimes are occurring throughout most of North America and that their current spatial distribution may be a strong barrier to dispersal and gene flow across many species' ranges. Thus, even though adaptation to climate change may potentially be more common and rapid than previously thought, species whose ranges overlap with asynchronous regimes will likely succumb to local declines that may be difficult to mitigate via dispersal. Future climate-related predictive frameworks should therefore incorporate asynchronous regimes as well as more traditional measures of climate velocity in order to fully capture the array of potential future climate change scenarios.",2018,"NOV","Ecography","41","9","1428-1440","WOS:000443303200002","10.1111/ecog.03234","","#10992","Senner 2018","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-14 13:03:58)(Select): Paper is a review but also an original research study - climate impacts yes, flow yes (migratory birds), the biodiversity impact is to the populations of the migratory birds (Hudsonian godwit) - which has a phenological mismatch due to climate change.

Genomic evidence differentiates two populations in the four management units, whereas there is non-genetic spatial structure within each of the stock boundaries. There are different core juvenile areas and a diversity of spawning migration patterns influenced by timing, fish size, maturity state, and distance between summer-feeding and over-wintering habitats. From tagging studies, multiple estimates of median distance at recapture (similar to 3-90 km) are much less than the spatial domain of each stock. Growth rates are faster in the warmer south, as predicted by growing degree day.

We review observed impacts of climate change on bats and identify risk factors allowing species-specific predictions. The impact on species is reviewed in relation to six aspects, namely foraging, roosting, reproduction, biogeography, extreme weather events and indirect effects of climate change. For some aspects of species' ecology, there are insufficient data available to make accurate assessment of impacts. We identify seven risk factors encompassing three broad aspects: biogeography - small range size, high latitude or high altitude range and a range occupying a geographic area likely to become water stressed; foraging niche - frugivory and species restricted to aerial hawking; dispersal ability - species with restricted dispersal behaviour. We use the European and north-west African bats as a case study to assess the relative risk of climate change to individual species.

We conducted a knowledge synthesis to assess the state of research on IAS range shifts under climate change in Canada. We found that the study of IAS distribution changes caused by climate change is a relatively new field of inquiry that integrates research in the areas of ecology, conservation biology, and environmental sciences. The multidisciplinary dimensions of the issue are largely overlooked in the scholarly literature, with most studies having a purely natural science perspective. Very little original research has occurred in the field to date; instead literature reviews are common. Research focuses on modeling range changes of current IAS threats, rather than predicting potential future IAS threats. The most commonly studied IAS already occur in Canada as native species that have spread beyond their range (e. g., lyme disease, mountain pine beetle, smallmouth bass) or as established invaders (e. g., gypsy moth). All of these IAS are expected to expand northward with climate change, resulting in widespread negative impacts on forest and freshwater biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and public health.

D.","Although burbot (Lota lota Gadidae) are widespread and abundant throughout much of their natural range, there are many populations that have been extirpated, endangered or are in serious decline. Due in part to the species' lack of popularity as a game and commercial fish, few regions consider burbot in management plans. We review the worldwide population status of burbot and synthesize reasons why some burbot populations are endangered or declining, some burbot populations have recovered and some burbot populations do not recover despite management measures. Burbot have been extirpated in much of Western Europe and the United Kingdom and are threatened or endangered in much of North America and Eurasia. Pollution and habitat change, particularly the effects of dams, appear to be the main causes for declines in riverine burbot populations. Pollution and the adverse effects of invasive species appear to be the main reasons for declines in lacustrine populations.

"83",NA,"Species migrations and range shifts: A synthesis of causes and consequences","Tomiolo, S.; Ward, D.","In increasingly changing environments, plant species are forced to either adapt to novel conditions or shift their ranges to track their ecological niches. Those species that can successfully track their niche may minimize extinction risks. However, establishment of new species into recipient communities will lead to species rearrangement and novel biotic interactions. Currently, we have a limited understanding of how these processes affect communities and ecosystems. In this review we synthesize current knowledge on range-expanding species. We start with addressing the many terms used for describing different aspects of range expansions, such as native-invasive, encroachers, and intra-continental invasive species. Thereafter, we describe the factors driving range expansions, and the effects on recipient communities and at the ecosystem level. Our research indicates that, similar to the study of biological invasions, current knowledge on range expansions is highly biased, with most of the studies focusing on Europe and North America. A large part of the available research targets trees and shrubs and the most investigated habitats are grasslands, savannas and high-elevation habitats. One potential consequence of such research bias is that range expansion of many herbaceous species (especially of those species not important for agriculture) may go undetected. Another important finding is that the same factor may promote or hinder range expansion depending on habitat, life form, spatial and temporal scale at which the process is studied. Finally, while many range expansions have negative consequences on local biodiversity and community stability, some of them have positive effects (e.g. mangroves). Although an increasing number of studies investigated the effects of range expansion on recipient communities, our research indicates that we still have a limited knowledge of such processes. Future efforts should integrate both empirical and modeling approaches to disentangle the joint effects of biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors on range expansion. Such research should focus both on the immediate-and longer-term implications of range expansions.",2018,"AUG","PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS","33","","62-77","WOS:000439670800007","10.1016/j.ppees.2018.06.001","","#12207","Tomiolo 2018","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-14 11:48:55)(Select): Here is a relevant section: """"The term intra-continental

While Kalm's 'Travels into North America' is well known, his 1754 report remains obscure. Some authors were skeptical that Kalm referred to A. americanum because he encountered them at sites farther north outside of the species' range. However, the details in 1754 report leave no doubt that Kalm described lone star ticks. In this historical review, we provide support for Kalm's identification using a modern translation of his 1754 report and other sources. We also delineate distributional changes of lone star ticks from the pre-colonization era to the present and interpret them in the context of large-scale anthropogenic changes in the landscape. In this framework, the lone star tick's current northward expansion is a recolonization of their former range. Extensive deforestation and extirpation of their principal host species, white-tailed deer, led to A. americanum's disappearance from the northern parts of its range by the 20th century. Subsequent recolonization by second-growth forest and increases in white-tailed deer populations by the mid-20th century is now allowing A. americanum to reclaim its former range.These changes in the land appear to be the driving force behind A. americanum's present expansion. Understanding this species' history and the factors contributing to its current expansion will enable better predictions about its future distribution and potential to transmit human pathogens.

We primarily consider the ecological and physical resilience of aquaculture in the Gulf of Maine (GoM), where a thriving industry includes marine algae, extensive and intensive shellfish aquaculture, and a well-established Atlantic salmon industry, as well as the infrastructure required to support these economically important ventures. The historical record of sea surface temperature in the GoM, estimated from gridded, interpolated in situ measurements, shows considerable interannual and decade-scale variability superimposed on an overall warming trend. Climate model projections of sea surface temperature indicate that the surface waters in the GoM could warm 0.5-3.5 degrees C beyond recent values by the year 2100. This suggests that, while variability will continue, anomalous warmth of marine heatwaves that have been observed in the past decade could become the norm in the GoM ca. 2050, but with the most significant impacts to existing aquaculture along the southernmost region of the coast. We consider adaptations leading to aquacultural resilience despite the effects of warming, larger numbers of harmful nonindigenous species (including pathogens and parasites), acidification, sea-level rise, and more frequent storms and storm surges. Some new species will be needed, but immediate attention to adapt existing species (e.g. preserve/define wild biodiversity, breed for temperature tolerance and incorporate greater husbandry) and aquaculture infrastructure can be successful.

For analytical purposes, the geographic range of Atlantic salmon rivers is divided into 5 regions (Western Europe, Scandanavia and Russia, Canadian Sheild, Northern Islands, and New England, Nova Scotia and Gaspe Peninsular), based on geomorphology and climate. The geology varies from granitic bedrock to volcanic and glacial substrates, which influence a broad array of other ecological variables, ranging from water chemistry to catchment morphology (e.g. river length). Flood regimes and system hydrology were dependent, as expected, on climate. Other factors considered include length of growing season, the role of ice, productivity, riparian vegetation, land uses/major impacts and aquatic temperature regime. Most rivers were characterized as oligotrophic with relatively low annual primary productivity. However, physical factors such as availability of suitable spawning and rearing habitat, as well as aquatic temperature and flow regimes, may drive anadromous productivity. In general, most of the rivers have been modified by flow regulation and many suffer from impacts related to other anthropogenic disturbances, principally riparian forest clearing for agriculture, forestry and urban development.

Human infection, which occurs as a result of spillover from this cycle, is generally subclinical or results in a self-limiting febrile illness. Central nervous system infection occurs in a minority of infections and can lead to long-term neurological complications and, rarely, death. WNV is the most prevalent arthropod-borne virus in the United States. Climate change can influence several aspects of WNV transmission including the vector, amplifying host, and virus. Climate change is broadly predicted to increase WNV distribution and risk across the globe, yet there will likely be significant regional variability and limitations to this effect. Increases in temperature can accelerate mosquito and pathogen development, drive increases in vector competence for WNV, and also alter mosquito life history traits including longevity, blood feeding behavior and fecundity. Precipitation, humidity and drought also impact WNV transmissibility. Alteration in avian distribution, diversity and phenology resulting from climate variation add additional complexity to these relationships. Here, we review WNV epidemiology, transmission, disease and genetics in the context of laboratory studies, field investigations, and infectious disease models under climate change.

We propose a framework that integrates how climate change affects spatial population dynamics and the effects of habitat fragmentation in terms of: (i) habitat quality, quantity and distribution; (ii) habitat connectivity; and (iii) the dynamics of habitat itself. We use the framework to categorize existing autecological studies and investigate how each is affected by anthropogenic climate change. It is clear that a changing climate produces changes in the geographic distribution of climatic conditions, and the amount and quality of habitat. The most thorough published studies show how such changes impact metapopulation persistence, source-sink dynamics, changes in species' geographic range and community composition. Climate-related changes in movement behavior and quantity, quality and distribution of habitat have also produced empirical changes in habitat connectivity for some species. An underexplored area is how habitat dynamics that are driven by climatic processes will affect species that live in dynamic habitats.

S.","The importance of efficaciously assessing the risk for introduction and establishment of pest species is an increasingly important ecological and economic issue. Evaluation of climate is fundamental to determining the potential success of an introduced or invasive insect pest. However, evaluating climatic suitability poses substantial difficulties; climate can be measured and assessed in a bewildering array of ways. Some physiological filter, in essence a lens that focuses climate through the requirements and constraints of a potential pest introduction, is required. Difficulties in assessing climate suitability are further exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) is an exotic, tree-defoliating insect that is frequently introduced into the western United States. In spite of an abundance of potential host species, these introductions have yet to result in established populations. The success of eradication efforts and the unsuccessful establishment of many detected and undetected introductions may be related to an inhospitable climate. Climatic suitability for gypsy moth in the western United States, however, is potentially improving, perhaps rapidly, due to a general warming trend that began in the mid 1970s and continues today. In this work, we describe the application of a physiologically based climate suitability model for evaluating risk of gypsy moth establishment on a landscape level. Development of this risk assessment system first required amassing databases that integrated the gypsy moth climatic assessment model, with host species distributions, and climate (historical, present, and future). This integrated system was then used to evaluate climate change scenarios for native host species in Utah, with the result that risk of establishment will dramatically increase during the remainder of the 21st century under reasonable climate change scenarios. We then applied the risk assessment system to several case histories of detected gypsy moth introductions in Utah. These applications demonstrated the general utility of the system for predicting risk of establishment and for designing improved risk detection strategies.",2007,"","Ecological Applications","17","1","101-117","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2007)017[0101:RAITFO]2.0.CO;2","","#20547","Logan 2007","","Biotic",NA,FALSE,TRUE,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE

Like most hotspots, the Southeast is also threatened by human activities, with the total reduction of southeastern grasslands estimated as 90 percent (upwards to 100 percent for some types) and with many threats escalating today. This report summarizes the results of a multistakeholder workshop organized by the Southeastern Grasslands Initiative and the U.S. Geological Survey, held in January 2020 to provide a scientific needs assessment to help inform the Species Status Assessment (SSA) process under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, with a focus on grassland species and communities of conservation concern in the southeastern United States. This report reviews the ecology of southeastern grasslands, including influences on their origin, maintenance, and high species richness and endemism; presents findings from the workshop; and discusses science questions, hypotheses, and possibilities for future research projects to help fill key knowledge gaps. Participants in the January 2020 workshop, representing diverse expertise in various topics in southeastern grassland ecology, were tasked with identifying major threats to grassland species in the Southeast as well as potential ways to make the SSA process more efficient and effective. An underlying assumption and starting place for workshop discussion was that an ecosystem-based approach to the SSA process is more cost-efficient than a species-by-species approach, in large part because many species with similar biological requirements can be addressed by the same actions. Nevertheless, one partner in this effort, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, does require specific attention be given to taxa that have been petitioned for Federal listing, though as often as possible these taxa are considered alongside a larger group of priority taxa with an ecosystem approach. For group discussions, workshop participants followed a modified """"World Cafe"""" method, a structured conversational approach for knowledge sharing. Group discussions focused on five categories of threats to grassland communities and species: (1) habitat loss, fragmentation, and disruption of functional population connectivity; (2) climate change, especially changes in temperature and precipitation, including intensity and seasonality, and impacts on soil moisture, groundwater levels, and other ecosystem parameters; (3) changes to disturbance regimes, as influenced by climate and land-use change, extinctions, and human attitudes and behaviors; (4) invasive species (not limited to nonnative species); and (5) localized or subregional impacts such as sea-level rise. In addition to group discussions, workshop participants-as well as other grassland experts who were unable to attend the workshop-completed a preworkshop survey concerning challenges and opportunities for grassland conservation.

Forest ecosystems are particularly sensitive to climate change as their vulnerability is manifested, in part, as an upsurge in natural disturbances such as native insect outbreaks. The mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a phloem-feeding bark beetle indigenous to western North America that attacks most species of pine including its major hosts, lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine. Adult mass aggregation, mediated by pheromones, helps the beetle to overcome tree defenses eventually killing the tree. Recent outbreaks of this insect have caused extensive pine mortality and have affected millions of hectares of forested area in western North America. Climate is a major driver of these outbreaks. In this review, we describe the direct influences of various climate-related factors on MPB development, outbreak behavior, and range expansion and their indirect impact on MPB epidemiology via influences on host trees and MPB-associated fungi. We also underscore the ecological and economic consequences of the recent, unprecedented MPB outbreak. Of serious concern currently is whether climate change will facilitate rapid establishment and spread of MPB in naive pine forests.

J.","Assisted migration entails the human assisted movement of individuals to more climatically-suitable areas within or outside of their current species range to help species respond to climate change. To better understand the potential for assisted migration to benefit species threatened by climate change, we conducted an evidence synthesis to map examples where assisted migration has been implemented around the world. With this mapping exercise, we collate and describe the quantity and key characteristics of the available evidence base, including the taxa, species conservation status, locations, and contexts relating to the use of this conservation tactic. Findings from this exercise highlight that assisted migration has been implemented very few times as a conservation tactic, though assisted migration has been conducted experimentally (for research purposes) and inadvertently (e.g., for reforestation) much more frequently. Assisted migration was most common for plants (particularly trees), followed by birds, and was rarely implemented for other taxa. Our review highlights the need for more research on assisted migration, with particular emphasis on understanding the population- and community-level outcomes of these actions. Our discussion focuses on the potential for assisted migration of Canadian species but will be informative to those considering assisted migration in other jurisdictions.",2023,"","Biological Conservation","280","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.109932","","#23997","Twardek 2023","","Biotic; Intervention; Transboundary unclear",NA,FALSE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE

S.","Globally, foliar pathogenic fungi cause serious losses of annual and perennial crops, ornamentals, landscape plants and forest trees. Plant pathogens that infect foliage are a diverse assemblage of fungi representing both phyla: Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Although most of the species found on living leaves have been well studied by mycologists and plant pathologists, recent studies have remarkably enhanced the current understanding of species numbers and their evolutionary relationships. The impact of global climate change, the increasing international exchange of plant material and the lack of proper phytosanitary practices have resulted in the potential re-emergences of formerly known destructive fungi, infecting new hosts in new geographic locations. Routinely inspecting diseased plants and accurately identifying and naming causative agents are vital for mitigating the impact of invasive and other non-indigenous pathogens on crops and native flora. It is also necessary to characterise foliar pathogenic fungi based on molecular phylogeny, morphology, pathogenicity and the comparative analysis of fungal genomic data. This review provides an overview of prevalent groups of foliar pathogenic fungi, their diversity and economic impact, while emphasising emerging and destructive species that threaten global food security and ecosystem health.",2020,"","Special Issue on Plant Health 2019 Sri Lanka.","49","Special Issue","337-353","","http://dx.doi.org/10.4038/cjs.v49i5.7801","","#24007","Udayanga 2020","Grace Westphal (2024-08-06 07:08:18)(Select): Pathogens that impact crops growth across north america (maize, wheat, rice) are discussed - however the link to geography is not explicit.; ","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",NA,FALSE,TRUE,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE

R.; Starks, P. J.; Will, R. E.; Zhong, Yu; Acharya, B. S.","In the Great Plains of the central United States, water resources for human and aquatic life rely primarily on surface runoff and local recharge from rangelands that are under rapid transformation to woodland by the encroachment of Eastern redcedar (redcedar; Juniperus virginiana) trees. In this synthesis, the current understanding and impact of redcedar encroachment on the water budget and water resources available for non-ecosystem use are reviewed. Existing studies concluded that the conversion from herbaceous-dominated rangeland to redcedar woodland increases precipitation loss to canopy interception and vegetation transpiration. The decrease of soil moisture, particularly for the subsurface soil layer, is widely documented. The depletion of soil moisture is directly related to the observed decrease in surface runoff, and the potential of deep recharge for redcedar encroached watersheds. Model simulations suggest that complete conversion of the rangelands to redcedar woodland at the watershed and basin scale in the South-central Great Plains would lead to reduced streamflow throughout the year, with the reductions of streamflow between 20 to 40% depending on the aridity of the climate of the watershed. Recommended topics for future studies include: (i) The spatial dynamics of redcedar proliferation and its impact on water budget across a regional hydrologic network; (ii) the temporal dynamics of precipitation interception by the herbaceous canopy; (iii) the impact of redcedar infilling into deciduous forests such as the Cross Timbers and its impact on water budget and water availability for non-ecosystem use; (iv) land surface and climate interaction and cross-scale hydrological modeling and forecasting; (v) impact of redcedar encroachment on sediment production and water quality; and (vi) assessment and efficacy of different redcedar control measures in restoring hydrological functions of watershed.",2018,"","Water","10","12","1768","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10121768","","#24971","Zou 2018","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-15 11:38:00)(Select): The flow is water, water reduction due to the spread of redcedar - range is in US and extends up into Canada.

"98",NA,"A review of the interaction between forest birds and eastern spruce budworm","Venier, LA; Holmes, S B","The eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana Clem., (hereafter budworm) is responsible for the largest areas of insect-caused disturbance in North America, and as such, is an important part of spruce-fir forest change and succession. The insectivorous forest bird community shows large and rapid responses to budworm outbreaks. There is good evidence that there are budworm-linked species (bay-breasted, Cape May, and Tennessee warblers) that respond to budworm outbreak much more strongly and consistently than other species, probably through increased productivity of local populations when budworm are abundant. There also appears to be a more widespread positive bird community response to budworm outbreak that involves many more species. The response is evident in local and regional scale studies, but individual species' responses across studies are not always consistent, probably because of the relatively small number of studies conducted in a wide variety of contexts. Budworm outbreaks provide a short-term increase in food supply for birds, but also result in longer-term habitat change due to budworm-induced defoliation and tree mortality. Birds appear to influence budworm cycles, mostly at endemic population levels, through predation of large larvae and pupae. There are good arguments suggesting that bird predation is not the primary cause of budworm oscillations, but may play a role in determining the mean level of oscillations. Climate change is expected to change the bird-budworm relationship through changes in fire regimes, spruce-fir distributions, bird distributions, and budworm and bird phenology.Original Abstract: La tordeuse du bourgeon de l'epinette, Choristoneura fumiferana Clem., (ci-apres nommee tordeuse) est responsable des plus grandes superficies devastees par des insectes en Amerique du Nord, et comme telle joue un role important dans les changements et la succession des forets de sapin et d'epinette. La communaute des oiseaux forestiers insectivores reagit fortement et rapidement aux invasions par la tordeuse. Il semble evident qu'il existe des relations entre les especes liees a la tordeuse (parulines a flanc marron, du Cap May et du Tennessee) qui reagissent aux epidemies de tordeuses plus fortement et plus regulierement que les autres especes, probablement par une productivite accrue des populations locales lorsque les tordeuses sont abondantes. Il semble egalement y avoir plus de reactions positives et etendues de la communaute aviaire impliquant plusieurs autres especes. La reaction est evidente dans les etudes a l'echelle locale et regionale, mais les reactions des especes individuelles pour l'ensemble des especes ne sont pas toujours congrues, probablement liees au nombre relativement faible d'etudes conduites dans une grande variete de contexte. Les epidemies de tordeuses fournissent une augmentation a court terme de nourriture pour les oiseaux, mais conduisent aussi a des modifications a long terme de l'habitat suite a la defoliation causee par la tordeuse et la mortalite des arbres. Les oiseaux semblent influencer les cycles de la tordeuse, surtout a l'etat endemique des populations, par predation des grosses larves et des pupes. Il y a de bons arguments suggerant que la predation par les oiseaux ne constitue pas la cause primaire des oscillations de la tordeuse, mais pourrait jouer un role determinant dans le degre moyen d'oscillation. On s'attend a ce que le changement climatique modifie la relation entre les oiseaux et la tordeuse par le changement des regimes des feux, des distributions du sapin et de l'epinette, de la distribution des oiseaux et de la phenologie de la tordeuse et des oiseaux.",2010,"01-01","Environmental Reviews","18","","191-207","","https://doi.org/10.1139/A10-009","","#25560","Venier 2010","","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",NA,FALSE,TRUE,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE
"99",NA,"An international borderland of concern: Conservation of biodiversity in the Lower Rio Grande Valley","Leslie, David M, Jr","The Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of southern Texas is located on the United States-Mexico borderland and represents a 240-kilometer (150-mile) linear stretch that ends at the Gulf of Mexico. The LRGV represents a unique transition between temperate and tropical conditions and, as such, sustains an exceptionally high diversity of plants and animals-some of them found in few, or no other, places in the United States. Examples include Leopardus pardalis albescens(northern ocelot) and Falco femoralis septentrionalis(northern aplomado falcon)-both endangered in the United States and emblematic of the LRGV. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) manages three national wildlife refuges (Santa Ana, Lower Rio Grande Valley, and Laguna Atascosa) that together make up the South Texas Refuge Complex, which actively conserves biodiversity in about 76,006 hectares (187,815.5 acres) of native riparian and upland habitats in the LRGV. These diminished habitats harbor many rare, threatened, and endangered species. This report updates the widely used 1988 USFWS biological report titled """"Tamaulipan Brushland of the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas: Description, Human Impacts, and Management Options"""" by synthesizing nearly 400 peer-reviewed scientific publications that have resulted from biological and sociological research conducted specifically in the four Texas counties of the LRGV in the past nearly 30 years. This report has three goals: (1) synthesize scientific insights gained since 1988 related to the biology and management of the LRGV and its unique biota, focusing on flora and fauna of greatest conservation concern; (2) update ongoing challenges facing Federal and State agencies and organizations that focus on conservation or key natural resources in the LRGV; and (3) redefine conservation opportunities and land-acquisition strategies that are feasible and appropriate today, given the many new and expanding constraints that challenge conservation activities in the LRGV. The LRGV faces every contemporary conservation challenge of the 21st century, but ongoing human population growth and its associated demands, international border issues, and oil, gas, and alternative energy development dominate impacts that affect conservation in the LRGV. Continued careful syntheses of existing and future information collected in the LRGV are needed on many biological and sociological topics to guide conservation activities. Quick response will no doubt be necessary to face contemporary and difficult-to-predict challenges such as climate change, diminished water availability and quality, spread of invasive species, and habitat loss and fragmentation. Complexities of a guarded international borderland add pressure to small patches of native habitat that remain in many places of the LRGV, particularly along the Rio Grande. Large connected corridors of restored native habitat could be the best option to maintain, and even enhance, the exceptional biodiversity of the LRGV in the face of exceptional human demand.",2016,"01-01","Scientific Investigations Report.

This may cause the poleward shifts in the range limits of species that are only found in specific thermal habitats. Such range shifts have been recorded in a number of plant and animal species. In the last 3 decades, we observed a decline in the presence of Pacific white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus obliquidens in the southwest Gulf of California (GOC), which is considered the southern boundary of their distribution. Considering that the thermal environment is physiologically important to animals, we believe that this poleward shift in the usual geographic range of the Pacific white-sided dolphin is due to long-term changes in the local climate. To obtain the conceptual framework needed to discuss such a hypothesis, we summarize and analyze current knowledge about Pacific white-sided dolphins in the southwest GOC, and sea surface temperature variability at a regional scale.",2010,"03-01","Endangered Species Research","11","1","13-19","","https://doi.org/10.3354/esr00252","","#26763","Salvadeo 2010","Meagan Oldfather (2024-10-08 05:31:02)(Select): Possibility of transboundary shifts mentioned in discussion;","Biotic",NA,FALSE,TRUE,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE
