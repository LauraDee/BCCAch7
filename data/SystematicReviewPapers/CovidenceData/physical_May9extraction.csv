"1","Global climate change and contaminants-an overview of opportunities and priorities for modelling the potential implications for long-term human exposure to organic compounds in the Arctic","Armitage, J. M.; Quinn, C. L.; Wania, F.","This overview seeks to provide context and insight into the relative importance of different aspects related to global climate change for the exposure of Northern residents to organic contaminants. A key objective is to identify, from the perspective of researchers engaged in contaminant fate, transport and bioaccumulation modelling, the most useful research questions with respect to projecting the long-term trends in human exposure. Monitoring studies, modelling results, the magnitude of projected changes and simplified quantitative approaches are used to inform the discussion. Besides the influence of temperature on contaminant amplification and distribution, accumulation of organic contaminants in the Arctic is expected to be particularly sensitive to the reduction/elimination of sea-ice cover and also changes to the frequency and intensity of precipitation events (most notably for substances that are highly susceptible to precipitation scavenging). Changes to key food-web interactions, in particular the introduction of additional trophic levels, have the potential to exert a relatively high influence on contaminant exposure but the likelihood of such changes is difficult to assess. Similarly, changes in primary productivity and dynamics of organic matter in aquatic systems could be influential for very hydrophobic contaminants, but the magnitude of change that may occur is uncertain. Shifts in the amount and location of chemical use and emissions are key considerations, in particular if substances with relatively low long range transport potential are used in closer proximity to, or even within, the Arctic in the future. Temperature-dependent increases in emissions via (re)volatilization from primary and secondary sources outside the Arctic are also important in this regard. An increased frequency of boreal forest fires has relevance for compounds emitted via biomass burning and revolatilization from soil during/after burns but compound-specific analyses are limited by the availability of reliable emission factors. However, potentially more influential for human exposure than changes to the physical environment are changes in human behaviour. This includes the gradual displacement of traditional food items by imported foods from other regions, driven by prey availability and/or consumer preference, but also the possibility of increased exposure to chemicals used in packaging materials and other consumer products, driven by dietary and lifestyle choices.",2011,"JUN","Journal of Environmental Monitoring","13","6","1532-1546","WOS:000291403300001","10.1039/c1em10131e","","#572","Armitage 2011","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-06 08:14:52)(Select): This references biotransport - """"(ii) long-range

"2","Large freshwater lakes: present state, trends, and future","Beeton, A. M.","The large freshwater lakes of the world are an extremely valuable resource, not only because 68% of the global liquid surface fresh water is contained in them, but because of their importance to the economies, social structure, and viability of the riparian countries. This review provides decision makers with the knowledge of large lakes (greater than or equal to500km(2)) essential to establishing policies and implementing strategies compatible with sustainable development. This is achieved by considering the present state of the lakes, the extent of changes and factors causing them, long-term consequences of these changes, major threats and possible states of the lakes into the year 2025. Case studies of lakes are presented, namely the St Lawrence Great Lakes of North America as representatives of glacial scour lakes of North America, northern Europe and Asia, and the African Great Lakes as representatives of tropical tectonic lakes. Lake Baikal is also included because it is unique for its species, great age, and largest single volume of liquid surface fresh water. The Aral Sea is further included because of the ecological disaster following diversion of water away from its basin. The major impacts on large lakes are diversions, eutrophication, invasive species, land-use change, overexploitation of resources, and pollution. These impacts can or do affect all the representative lakes, but to varying degree. The St Lawrence Great Lakes have been severely impacted by eutrophication, land-use change, overfishing, invasive species and pollution. Eutrophication has been reversed for these lakes and constraints are now in place on land use change, such as shoreline alteration and destruction of wetlands. With the demise of most commercial fishing, overfishing is no longer as important. Invasive species have become a major problem as increasingly non-indigenous species gain access to the takes. Pollution continues as a major impact. These problems are likely to continue and seriously impact use of the resources as well as bring about changes in the biota. Among the African Great Lakes, invasive species are a major problem in Lake Victoria, and eutrophication associated with land-use change and overexploitation of resources is a growing problem. Many endemic species have been lost and many are threatened, so that species associations will have changed by 2025. The Aral Sea continues to disappear and in the future, the remaining largest part of it will continue to become increasingly saline and eventually disappear. A small body of water will remain as a freshwater lake with a productive, although small, fishery. Lake Baikal shows evidence of pollution in the southern basin and is likely to be impacted by land-use changes, primarily logging. Some non-indigenous species are present, but so far, they are not a major problem. Overexploitation of resources in the watershed could lead to adverse impacts on inshore waters. Overfishing has been recognized and appears under control. The major threat to Baikal is continued and growing pollution. Climate change and pollution are global problems that will affect all lakes, large and small. At present, while some warming has occurred, climate change appears not to have impacted large lakes. Present studies on the Laurentian Great Lakes predict possible major impacts. Pollution, especially from persistent toxic substances such as PCBs, is a global problem. Diversion of water out or away from large lakes will become more of a threat as global human population growth continues and water supplies from rivers and ground water become depleted.",2002,"MAR","Environmental Conservation","29","1","21-38","WOS:000175924000003","10.1017/S0376892902000036","","#997","Beeton 2002","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-06 09:09:57)(Select): This is an old review and references 2025 as the future for future climate change impacts (next year!).

M.; Shook, K.; Demuth, M. N.; Pietroniro, A.","The interior of western Canada, like many similar cold mid- to high-latitude regions worldwide, is undergoing extensive and rapid climate and environmental change, which may accelerate in the coming decades. Understanding and predicting changes in coupled climate-land-hydrological systems are crucial to society yet limited by lack of understanding of changes in cold-region process responses and interactions, along with their representation in most current-generation land-surface and hydrological models. It is essential to consider the underlying processes and base predictive models on the proper physics, especially under conditions of non-stationarity where the past is no longer a reliable guide to the future and system trajectories can be unexpected. These challenges were forefront in the recently completed Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN), which assembled and focused a wide range of multi-disciplinary expertise to improve the understanding, diagnosis, and prediction of change over the cold interior of western Canada. CCRN advanced knowledge of fundamental cold-region ecological and hydrological processes through observation and experimentation across a network of highly instrumented research basins and other sites. Significant efforts were made to improve the functionality and process representation, based on this improved understanding, within the fine-scale Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform and the large-scale Modelisation Environmentale Communautaire (MEC) - Surface and Hydrology (MESH) model. These models were, and continue to be, applied under past and projected future climates and under current and expected future land and vegetation cover configurations to diagnose historical change and predict possible future hydrological responses. This second of two articles synthesizes the nature and understanding of cold-region processes and Earth system responses to future climate, as advanced by CCRN. These include changing precipitation and moisture feedbacks to the atmosphere; altered snow regimes, changing balance of snowfall and rainfall, and glacier loss; vegetation responses to climate and the loss of ecosystem resilience to wildfire and disturbance; thawing permafrost and its influence on landscapes and hydrology; groundwater storage and cycling and its connections to surface water; and stream and river discharge as influenced by the various drivers of hydrological change. Collective insights, expert elicitation, and model application are used to provide a synthesis of this change over the CCRN region for the late 21st century.",2021,"APR 9","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","25","4","1849-1882","WOS:000639027600002","10.5194/hess-25-1849-2021","","#2886","DeBeer 2021","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-02 06:10:48)(Select): The maps show parts of the U.S., and the ecosystems being discussed certainly overlap at the border, but I could not find any mention of transboundary flows that specifically cross US/Canada borders.

M.; Potter, C.; Goetz, S.","Ecosystems in the North American Arctic-Boreal Zone (ABZ) experience a diverse set of disturbances associated with wildfire, permafrost dynamics, geomorphic processes, insect outbreaks and pathogens, extreme weather events, and human activity. Climate warming in the ABZ is occurring at over twice the rate of the global average, and as a result the extent, frequency, and severity of these disturbances are increasing rapidly. Disturbances in the ABZ span a wide gradient of spatiotemporal scales and have varying impacts on ecosystem properties and function. However, many ABZ disturbances are relatively understudied and have different sensitivities to climate and trajectories of recovery, resulting in considerable uncertainty in the impacts of climate warming and human land use on ABZ vegetation dynamics and in the interactions between disturbance types. Here we review the current knowledge of ABZ disturbances and their precursors, ecosystem impacts, temporal frequencies, spatial extents, and severity. We also summarize current knowledge of interactions and feedbacks among ABZ disturbances and characterize typical trajectories of vegetation loss and recovery in response to ecosystem disturbance using satellite time-series.

R.; Greenwood, G.; Mark, B. G.; Milner, A. M.; Weingartner, R.; Winder, M.","The cryosphere in mountain regions is rapidly declining, a trend that is expected to accelerate over the next several decades due to anthropogenic climate change. A cascade of effects will result, extending from mountains to lowlands with associated impacts on human livelihood, economy, and ecosystems. With rising air temperatures and increased radiative forcing, glaciers will become smaller and, in some cases, disappear, the area of frozen ground will diminish, the ratio of snow to rainfall will decrease, and the timing and magnitude of both maximum and minimum streamflow will change. These changes will affect erosion rates, sediment, and nutrient flux, and the biogeochemistry of rivers and proglacial lakes, all of which influence water quality, aquatic habitat, and biotic communities. Changes in the length of the growing season will allow low-elevation plants and animals to expand their ranges upward. Slope failures due to thawing alpine permafrost, and outburst floods from glacier-and moraine-dammed lakes will threaten downstream populations.Societies even well beyond the mountains depend on meltwater from glaciers and snow for drinking water supplies, irrigation, mining, hydropower, agriculture, and recreation.

M.; Tapia, E.; Springer, A.","Although riparian and aquatic ecosystems make up a small fraction of the area in arid and semi-arid lands, they are critical for the survival of desert life. There are, however, few compendia of efforts to define the quantity of water needed to maintain these ecosystems and understand the risks and stressors to them. Through our analysis we found that 62% of the rivers examined in the deserts of the U.S. and Mexico have had just one study over the past four decades and 67% of studies used qualitative methods. Furthermore, only one-third of the 312 species catalogued in our work have been studied more than once and only 5% have been considered five or more times. The most common risks or stressors to riparian and aquatic species were engineered structures, invasive species, and altered flows; and while 10% of studies included climate stressor, climate change impacts were infrequently examined. Ultimately, we found that although research has been conducted across the desert watersheds of the U.S. and Mexico, there are significant gaps in our knowledge of basic data such as the location and extent of perennial and intermittent streams, let alone studies of environmental flow needs.

It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood. Goals: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health. Methods: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention. Environmental Findings: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources - coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths. Ecosystem Findings: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks. Human Health Findings: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children's risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals - phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste - can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South - environmental injustice on a planetary scale. Conclusions: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth's resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted. Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored. Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries. Recommendations: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health. Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress. Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries. Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.",2020,"","ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH","86","1","","WOS:000595376400001","10.5334/aogh.2831","","#6701","Landrigan 2020","Elliott Parsons (2024-10-31 12:53:02)(Select): paper is a review, looks at intersection of ocean pollution and climate change - flows include ocean water (gyres), and air (distributing air pollution).

"8","Some Holocene palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental perspectives on Arctic/Subarctic climate warming and the IPCC 4th Assessment Report","Macdonald, G. M.","The IPCC 4th Assessment Report(FAR)is considered in light of Holocene palaeo-records of Arctic and Subarctic land temperatures and the response of the boreal forest-tundra boundary to past and present warming. The palaeo-records appear to support and amplify some of the conclusions in FAR and raise questions about others. Comparison of the FAR estimates for late 21st-century warming with Arctic and Subarctic palaeoclimatic records suggests that anticipated future warming will be unprecedented compared to earlier Holocene warming including the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) and subsequent Medieval Warm Period (MWP). Annual warming and winter warming will likely be greater than during earlier periods in the Holocene, but summer temperatures projected by FAR may approximate or not far exceed the summer warming of the HTM. The geographically synchronous pattern of 21st-century warming projected by FAR will differ from the observed geographic variability in the timing of the HTM, particularly in the western Arctic. Further palaeo-record syntheses are required to fully delineate the similarities and differences between the HTM and the projected conditions of the 21 st century. In addition, palaeo-records suggest that the Arctic and Subarctic climate may be sensitive to relatively small changes in solar irradiance and understanding the potential effects of natural variations in irradiance on the future climate of the Arctic and Subarctic remains a question deserving further research. FAR mapped estimates of a significant northward displacement of boreal forest and woodland clue to warming imply that boreal forest or woodland will displace tundra as far north as the Arctic coastline by AD 2100. In Eurasia the estimated AD 2100 location of the tree line appears to approximate the HTM location. In North America an advance of forest to the coastline on the north slope of Alaska, central Canada and northern Quebec would far outdistance the relatively limited northward advances of boreal forest during the HTM. However, rates of tree species advance and subsequent forest development based on palaeo-records and Currently observed tree line advances raise questions about the likelihood that northward migration and subsequent increases in the population sizes of boreal tree species could occur rapidly enough to establish continuous forest and woodland as far north as the Arctic coastlines of Eurasia and North America by AD 2100. Determining potential rates of northward advance of the northern forests requires further ecological and palaeoecological investigations.

"9","Implications of climate change for parasitism of animals in the aquatic environment","Marcogliese, D. J.","Climate change can occur over evolutionary and ecological time scales as a result of natural and anthropogenic causes. Considerable attention has been focused in recent years on the biological consequences of global warming. However, aside from studies on those deleterious parasites that cause disease in man, little effort has been dedicated to understanding the potential changes in the parasite fauna of animal populations, especially those in aquatic systems. Predictions using General Circulation Models, among others, are examined in terms of their consequences for parasite populations in freshwater and marine ecosystems, concentrating on the temperate and boreal regions of eastern North America. Biological effects due to global warming are not predictable simply in terms of temperature response. It is also essential to explore the effects on aquatic parasites of alterations in host distribution, water levels, eutrophication, stratification, ice cover, acidification, oceanic currents, ultraviolet-light penetration, weather extremes, and human interference. Evaluation of the potential response of parasites of aquatic organisms to climate change illustrates the complexity of host-parasite systems and the difficulty of making accurate predictions for biological systems. Parasites in aquatic systems will respond directly to changes in temperature but also indirectly to changes in other abiotic parameters that are mediated indirectly through changes in the distribution and abundance of their hosts. Local extirpations and introductions may be expected as a result. In the long term, climatic change may influence selection of different life-history traits, affecting parasite transmission and, potentially, virulence.",2001,"AUG","Canadian Journal of Zoology","79","8","1331-1352","WOS:000171013200001","10.1139/cjz-79-8-1331","","#7768","Marcogliese 2001","Elliott Parsons (2024-10-30 15:59:06)(Select): Yes review paper, climate change included, listed flows include biotic flows - movement of diseases, invasive species, biodiversity is highlighted, yes within NA, and yes, Canada/US areas are mentioned a few times; ","Biophysical",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

J.; Morris, A. D.; Muir, D. C. G.; Routti, H.; Yurkowski, D. J.","Global climate change has led to profound alterations of the Arctic environment and ecosystems, with potential sec-ondary effects on mercury (Hg) within Arctic biota. This review presents the current scientific evidence for impacts of direct physical climate change and indirect ecosystem change on Hg exposure and accumulation in Arctic terrestrial, freshwater, and marine organisms. As the marine environment is elevated in Hg compared to the terrestrial environ-ment, terrestrial herbivores that now exploit coastal/marine foods when terrestrial plants are iced over may be ex-posed to higher Hg concentrations. Conversely, certain populations of predators, including Arctic foxes and polar bears, have shown lower Hg concentrations related to reduced sea ice-based foraging and increased land-based forag-ing. How climate change influences Hg in Arctic freshwater fishes is not clear, but for lacustrine populations it may depend on lake-specific conditions, including interrelated alterations in lake ice duration, turbidity, food web length and energy sources (benthic to pelagic), and growth dilution. In several marine mammal and seabird species, tissue Hg concentrations have shown correlations with climate and weather variables, including climate oscillation indices and sea ice trends; these findings suggest that wind, precipitation, and cryosphere changes that alter Hg transport and deposition are impacting Hg concentrations in Arctic marine organisms. Ecological changes, including northward range shifts of sub-Arctic species and altered body condition, have also been shown to affect Hg levels in some populations of Arctic marine species. Given the limited number of populations and species studied to date, especially within Arctic terrestrial and freshwater systems, further research is needed on climate-driven processes influencing Hg concentrations in Arctic ecosystems and their net effects. Long-term pan-Arctic monitoring programs should consider ancillary datasets on climate, weather, organism ecology and physiology to improve interpretation of spatial variation and time trends of Hg in Arctic biota.",2022,"AUG 15","Science of the Total Environment","834","","","WOS:000796434600010","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155221","","#8026","McKinney 2022","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-02 09:56:22)(Select): review yes, climate change yes, flow yes (e.g., species shifting ranges and brining Hg contamination with them), biodiversity yes (mentioned throughout), NA yes, North America, Canada, Alaska mentioned multiple times, yes - there is reason to believe flows will move across borders though I could not find a specific example of this.; ","Biophysical; Biotic",TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Current risk reduction responses focus on reducing vulnerability and exposure. However, these approaches are not keeping up with climate change. Intervening in the cyclone hazard itself has the potential to prevent deaths and destruction, and reduce the costs of disaster recovery. We provide a technical review of these interventions. This unifies an otherwise sparse and disconnected literature, providing a starting point for further discussion by academics and policymakers. Potential interventions include cloud seeding, using pipes to inject cool water into cyclone hotspots, injecting particles into the upper atmosphere and atmospheric aerosol injections. Approaches have different logistical requirements, side effects and promise. Understanding the effectiveness and associated risks of different interventions will inform prudent cyclone risk management and research. Our review points to the promise of aerosol injection and high-altitude particle injection as first research directions. We also discuss potential governance risks and requirements of cyclone interventions. Cyclone interventions raise many issues, ranging from robust monitoring of ecological side effects, to geopolitics and politicisation. Current international climate governance is ill-suited for potential technologies on the horizon. Good decision-making is required to maximise benefits and reduce negative impacts.

M.","Forests and woodlands in the central Rocky Mountains span broad gradients in climate, elevation, and other environmental conditions, and therefore encompass a great diversity of species, ecosystem productivities, and fire regimes. The objectives of this review are: (1) to characterize the likely short- and longer-term effects of projected climate changes on fuel dynamics and fire regimes for four generalized forest types in the Rocky Mountain region; (2) to review how these changes are likely to affect carbon sequestration, water resources, air quality, and biodiversity; and (3) to assess the suitability of four different management alternatives to mitigate these effects and maintain forest ecosystem services. Current climate projections indicate that temperatures will increase in every season; forecasts for precipitation are less certain but suggest that the northern part of the region but not the southern part will experience higher annual precipitation. The increase in temperatures will result in a greater proportion of winter precipitation falling as rain, earlier spring snowmelt, and a consequential increase in the length and severity of fire seasons. Fire frequency is likely to increase in the short term in all areas because of the warmer, longer, and drier fire seasons, but this change is likely to lead to a longer-term reduction in vegetation productivity in some of the most moisture-limited forest types, such as pH-ion-juniper and lower montane. This will decrease fuel accumulation rates and consequently reduce fire risk and result in longer fire return intervals. We consider four main management alternatives: fire suppression, wildfire (no intervention), prescribed fire, and mechanical thinning. The paper summarizes the effects of these treatments on forest ecosystem services, showing that they vary widely by forest type. This broad-scale assessment provides general guidance for forest managers and policy makers, and identifies more specific research needs on how climate-driven changes in fuel production and forest conditions will affect impact the four main forest ecosystems across the central Rocky Mountain region.

We then highlight anticipated responses of select aquatic biota to these changes. We describe how climatic changes may interact with other anthropogenic stressors affecting freshwater habitats and consider the potential for evolutionary adaptation of freshwater aquatic organisms to mediate any responses. Given anticipated changes, we suggest aquatic ecosystem managers take a precautionary approach broadly applicable in temperate regions to (a) conserve a diversity of aquatic habitats, (b) enhance species diversity and both inter- and intra-population genetic variation, and (c) limit stressors which may exacerbate the risk of decline for aquatic biota.",2019,"","Special Issue: The Indiana climate change impacts assessment.","163","4","1897-1916","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02502-w","","#19248","Hook 2019","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-06 08:36:01)(Select): Climate change induced movement of species (native and invasive) mentioned multiple times.

C.; Coulibaly, P.","Groundwater in the Great Lakes Basin (GLB) serves as a reservoir of approximately 4000 to 5500 km3 of water and is a significant source of water to the Great Lakes. Indirect groundwater inflow from tributaries of the Great Lakes may account for 5-25% of the total water inflow to the Great Lakes and in Lake Michigan it is estimated that groundwater directly contributes 2-2.5% of the total water inflow. Despite these estimates, there is great uncertainty with respect to the impact of groundwater on surface water in the GLB. In terms of water quantity, groundwater discharge is spatially and temporally variable from the reach to the basin scale. Reach scale preferential flow pathways in the sub-surface play an important role in delivering groundwater to surface water bodies, however their identification is difficult a priori with existing data and their impact at watershed to basin scale is unknown. This variability also results in difficulty determining the location and contribution of groundwater to both point and non-point source surface water contamination. With increasing human population in the GLB and the hydrological changes brought on by continued human development and climate change, sound management of water resources will require a better understanding of groundwater surface-water interactions as heterogeneous phenomena both spatially and temporally.

This review describes the physical and biological mechanisms by which fish populations will be affected by changes in timing and duration of ice cover, precipitation events and temperature regimes associated with projected climate change in the Great Lakes Basin with a principal focus on the fish communities in shallower regons of the basin. Lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis, walleye Sander vitreus and smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu were examined to assess the potential effects of climate change on guilds of Great Lakes cold, cool and warm-water fishes, respectively. Overall, the projection for these fishes are for the increased thermally suitable habitat within the lakes, though in different regions than they currently inhabit. Colder-water fishes wil seek refuge further north and deeper in the water column and warmer-water fishes will fill the vacated habiat space in the warmer regions of the lakes. While these projection can be modified by a number of other habitat elements (e.g. anoxia, ice cover, dispersal ability and trophic productivity), it is clear that climate-change drivers will challenge the nature, flexibility and public perception of current fisheries management programmes.

"21","Recent climate change in the Arctic and its impact on contaminant pathways and interpretation of temporal trend data","Macdonald, R. W.; Harner, T.; Fyfe, J.","The Arctic has undergone dramatic change during the past decade. The observed changes include atmospheric sea-level pressure, wind fields, sea-ice drift, ice cover, length of melt season, change in precipitation patterns, change in hydrology and change in ocean currents and watermass distribution. It is likely that these primary changes have altered the carbon cycle and biological systems, but the difficulty of observing these together with sporadic, incomplete time series makes it difficult to evaluate what the changes have been. Because contaminants enter global systems and transport through air and water, the changes listed above will clearly alter contaminant pathways. Here, we review what is known about recent changes using the Arctic Oscillation as a proxy to help us understand the forms under which global change will be manifest in the Arctic. For Pb, Cd and Zn, the Arctic is likely to become a more effective trap because precipitation is likely to increase. In the case of Cd, the natural cycle in the ocean appears to have a much greater potential to alter exposure than do human releases of this metal. Mercury has an especially complex cycle in the Arctic including a unique scavenging process (mercury depletion events), biomagnifying foodwebs, and chemical transformations such as methylation. The observation that mercury seems to be increasing in a number of aquatic species whereas atmospheric gaseous mercury shows little sign of change suggests that factors related to change in the physical system (ice cover, permafrost degradation, organic carbon cycling) may be more important than human activities. Organochlorine contaminants offer a surprising array of possibilities for changed pathways. To change in precipitation patterns can be added change in ice cover (air-water exchange), change in food webs either from the top down or from the bottom up (biomagnification), change in the organic carbon cycle and change in diets. Perhaps the most interesting possibility, presently difficult to predict, is combination of immune suppression together with expanding ranges of disease vectors. Finally, biotransport through migratory species is exceptionally vulnerable to changes in migration strength or in migration pathway - in the Arctic, change in the distribution of ice and temperature may already have caused such changes. Hydrocarbons, which tend to impact surfaces, will be mostly affected by change in the ice climate (distribution and drift tracks). Perhaps the most dramatic changes will occur because our view of the Arctic Ocean will change as it becomes more amenable to transport, tourism and mineral exploration on the shelves. Radionuclides have tended not to produce a radiological problem in the Arctic; nevertheless one pathway, the ice, remains a risk because it can accrue, concentrate and transport radio-contaminated sediments. This pathway is sensitive to where ice is produced, what the transport pathways of ice are, and where ice is finally melted - all strong candidates for change during the coming century. The changes that have already occurred in the Arctic and those that are projected to occur have an effect on contaminant time series including direct measurements (air, water, biota) or proxies (sediment cores, ice cores, archive material). Although these 'system' changes can alter the flux and concentrations at given sites in a number of obvious ways, they have been all but ignored in the interpretation of such time series. To understand properly what trends mean, especially in complex 'recorders' such as seals, walrus and polar bears, demands a more thorough approach to time series by collecting data in a number of media coherently. Presently, a major reservoir for contaminants and the one most directly connected to biological uptake in species at greatest risk-the ocean-practically lacks such time series.",2005,"","Special Issue: Sources, occurrence, trends and pathways of contaminants in the arctic physical environment.","342","1/3","5-86","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2004.12.059","","#20685","Macdonald 2005","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-02 11:39:20)(Select): There is a whole section on climate change and the impacts on species through migration, and invasions.

The millions of prairie-pothole wetlands scattered across the Prairie Pothole Region (hereafter PPR) provide critical ecosystem functions at local, regional, and continental scales. However, an estimated loss of 50% of historical wetlands and the widespread conversion of grasslands to cropland make the PPR a heavily modified landscape. Therefore, it is essential to understand the current and potential future stressors affecting prairie-pothole wetland ecosystems in order to conserve and restore their functions. Here, we describe a conceptual model that illustrates how (a) historical wetland losses, (b) anthropogenic landscape modifications, and (c) climate change interact and have altered the variability among remaining depressional wetland ecosystems (i.e., ecosystem homogenization) in the PPR. We reviewed the existing literature to provide examples of wetland ecosystem homogenization, provide implications for wetland management, and identify informational gaps that require further study.

K.","The Great Miami (GM) and Little Miami (LM) watersheds in Ohio are included in the 51 major river systems in the United States for long-term assessment of conditions of water quality under the USGS National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loadings have decreased over the years in the GM and LM basins, however, they still remain among the highest concentrations detected in the nation. The latest nutrient loading analysis from Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) showed slightly above period of record averages for N and P. Significant amounts of mobilized agricultural N and P from fertilizers in watersheds are transported to the Ohio River and other coastal marine systems such as the Gulf of Mexico, leading to increased growth of harmful algal blooms. In the GM and LM watersheds, changes in flood frequency and intensity are projected to occur in the future as heavy precipitation events are likely to increase as a result of climate change. As climate plays a role for nutrient transformation and transport, studies have shown that N and P inputs to surface waters from agriculture and other sources are projected to continue to increase over the next several decades. This paper reviewed the means of how the GM and LM watersheds are ecologically affected by the N and P nutrient pollution and how climate change impacts the quantity of N and P loadings that go into the river systems.
