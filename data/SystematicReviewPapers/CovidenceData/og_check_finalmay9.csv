"1","Climate change-driven range losses among bumblebee species are poised to accelerate","Sirois-Delisle, C.; Kerr, J. T.","Climate change has shaped bee distributions over the past century. Here, we conducted the first species-specific assessment of future climate change impacts on North American bumblebee distributions, using the most recent global change scenarios developed in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We assessed potential shifts in bumblebee species distributions with models generated using Maxent. We tested different assumptions about bumblebee species' dispersal capacities, drawing on observed patterns of range shifts to date, dispersal rates observed for bumblebee queens, and, lastly, assuming unlimited dispersal. Models show significant contractions of current ranges even under scenarios in which dispersal rates were high. Results suggest that dispersal rates may not suffice for bumblebees to track climate change as rapidly as required under any IPCC scenario for future climate change. Areas where species losses are projected overlap for many species and climate scenarios, and are concentrated in eastern parts of the continent. Models also show overlap for range expansions across many species, suggesting the presence of """"hotspots"""" where management activities could benefit many species, across all climate scenarios. Broad-scale strategies are likely to be necessary to improve bumblebee conservation prospects under climate change.",2018,"OCT 18","Scientific Reports","8","","","WOS:000447589700001","10.1038/s41598-018-32665-y","","#11350","Sirois-Delisle 2018","Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-27 06:03:55)(Select): Figure 3 shows species gain in a transboundary area of US-CA;","Biotic; Original study",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
