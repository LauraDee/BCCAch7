"1","The ecological history of Lake Erie as recorded by the phytoplankton community","Allinger, L. E.; Reavie, E. D.","Lake Erie's water quality has fluctuated since European settlement due to cultural eutrophication and the effects of invasive species. Our attempts to understand the cause-and-effect linkages between observed ecosystem changes and various stressors are evolving. Non-indigenous species, pollutants, land-use and climate change that can alter a lake's physical and chemical environment can manifest rapid changes in community composition and abundance of phytoplankton. As such, for many decades researchers have used phytoplankton data from Lake Erie to track environmental changes. We provide a chronological account of previous and ongoing assessments of pelagic algae to summarize past and present environmental conditions of Lake Erie. This review necessarily focuses on diatom-based assessments as their preserved remains in sediments have been used to hind-cast human-induced impacts and recovery. Because of their uniqueness, this review summarizes where possible the long-term trends according to the western, central and eastern lake basins. Overall, this historical assessment summarizes a period of significant eutrophication throughout most of the 20th century, followed by water quality improvement due to nutrient reductions and establishment of filter-feeding dreissenids. Recent data suggest new issues associated with blooms of diatoms and blue-green algae. The challenges facing Lake Erie underline the need for continued monitoring and evaluation of historical records that will help us distinguish natural from anthropogenic changes, and to reveal the causes and extent of environmental insults in order to make management decisions.

"2","Global climate change and contaminants-an overview of opportunities and priorities for modelling the potential implications for long-term human exposure to organic compounds in the Arctic","Armitage, J. M.; Quinn, C. L.; Wania, F.","This overview seeks to provide context and insight into the relative importance of different aspects related to global climate change for the exposure of Northern residents to organic contaminants. A key objective is to identify, from the perspective of researchers engaged in contaminant fate, transport and bioaccumulation modelling, the most useful research questions with respect to projecting the long-term trends in human exposure. Monitoring studies, modelling results, the magnitude of projected changes and simplified quantitative approaches are used to inform the discussion. Besides the influence of temperature on contaminant amplification and distribution, accumulation of organic contaminants in the Arctic is expected to be particularly sensitive to the reduction/elimination of sea-ice cover and also changes to the frequency and intensity of precipitation events (most notably for substances that are highly susceptible to precipitation scavenging). Changes to key food-web interactions, in particular the introduction of additional trophic levels, have the potential to exert a relatively high influence on contaminant exposure but the likelihood of such changes is difficult to assess. Similarly, changes in primary productivity and dynamics of organic matter in aquatic systems could be influential for very hydrophobic contaminants, but the magnitude of change that may occur is uncertain. Shifts in the amount and location of chemical use and emissions are key considerations, in particular if substances with relatively low long range transport potential are used in closer proximity to, or even within, the Arctic in the future. Temperature-dependent increases in emissions via (re)volatilization from primary and secondary sources outside the Arctic are also important in this regard. An increased frequency of boreal forest fires has relevance for compounds emitted via biomass burning and revolatilization from soil during/after burns but compound-specific analyses are limited by the availability of reliable emission factors. However, potentially more influential for human exposure than changes to the physical environment are changes in human behaviour. This includes the gradual displacement of traditional food items by imported foods from other regions, driven by prey availability and/or consumer preference, but also the possibility of increased exposure to chemicals used in packaging materials and other consumer products, driven by dietary and lifestyle choices.",2011,"JUN","Journal of Environmental Monitoring","13","6","1532-1546","WOS:000291403300001","10.1039/c1em10131e","","#572","Armitage 2011","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-06 08:14:52)(Select): This references biotransport - """"(ii) long-range

"3","Large freshwater lakes: present state, trends, and future","Beeton, A. M.","The large freshwater lakes of the world are an extremely valuable resource, not only because 68% of the global liquid surface fresh water is contained in them, but because of their importance to the economies, social structure, and viability of the riparian countries. This review provides decision makers with the knowledge of large lakes (greater than or equal to500km(2)) essential to establishing policies and implementing strategies compatible with sustainable development. This is achieved by considering the present state of the lakes, the extent of changes and factors causing them, long-term consequences of these changes, major threats and possible states of the lakes into the year 2025. Case studies of lakes are presented, namely the St Lawrence Great Lakes of North America as representatives of glacial scour lakes of North America, northern Europe and Asia, and the African Great Lakes as representatives of tropical tectonic lakes. Lake Baikal is also included because it is unique for its species, great age, and largest single volume of liquid surface fresh water. The Aral Sea is further included because of the ecological disaster following diversion of water away from its basin. The major impacts on large lakes are diversions, eutrophication, invasive species, land-use change, overexploitation of resources, and pollution. These impacts can or do affect all the representative lakes, but to varying degree. The St Lawrence Great Lakes have been severely impacted by eutrophication, land-use change, overfishing, invasive species and pollution. Eutrophication has been reversed for these lakes and constraints are now in place on land use change, such as shoreline alteration and destruction of wetlands. With the demise of most commercial fishing, overfishing is no longer as important. Invasive species have become a major problem as increasingly non-indigenous species gain access to the takes. Pollution continues as a major impact. These problems are likely to continue and seriously impact use of the resources as well as bring about changes in the biota. Among the African Great Lakes, invasive species are a major problem in Lake Victoria, and eutrophication associated with land-use change and overexploitation of resources is a growing problem. Many endemic species have been lost and many are threatened, so that species associations will have changed by 2025. The Aral Sea continues to disappear and in the future, the remaining largest part of it will continue to become increasingly saline and eventually disappear. A small body of water will remain as a freshwater lake with a productive, although small, fishery. Lake Baikal shows evidence of pollution in the southern basin and is likely to be impacted by land-use changes, primarily logging. Some non-indigenous species are present, but so far, they are not a major problem. Overexploitation of resources in the watershed could lead to adverse impacts on inshore waters. Overfishing has been recognized and appears under control. The major threat to Baikal is continued and growing pollution. Climate change and pollution are global problems that will affect all lakes, large and small. At present, while some warming has occurred, climate change appears not to have impacted large lakes. Present studies on the Laurentian Great Lakes predict possible major impacts. Pollution, especially from persistent toxic substances such as PCBs, is a global problem. Diversion of water out or away from large lakes will become more of a threat as global human population growth continues and water supplies from rivers and ground water become depleted.",2002,"MAR","Environmental Conservation","29","1","21-38","WOS:000175924000003","10.1017/S0376892902000036","","#997","Beeton 2002","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-06 09:09:57)(Select): This is an old review and references 2025 as the future for future climate change impacts (next year!).

C.; Dvoretsky, A.; Gollasch, S.; Minchin, D.; David, M.; Jelmert, A.; Albretsen, J.; Bailey, S. A.","Climate change and increased anthropogenic activities are expected to elevate the potential of introducing nonindigenous species (NIS) into the Arctic. Yet, the knowledge base needed to identify gaps and priorities for NIS research and management is limited. Here, we reviewed primary introduction events to each ecoregion of the marine Arctic realm to identify temporal and spatial patterns, likely source regions of NIS, and the putative introduction pathways. We included 54 introduction events representing 34 unique NIS. The rate of NIS discovery ranged from zero to four species per year between 1960 and 2015. The Iceland Shelf had the greatest number of introduction events (n = 14), followed by the Barents Sea (n = 11), and the Norwegian Sea (n = 11). Sixteen of the 54 introduction records had no known origins. The majority of those with known source regions were attributed to the Northeast Atlantic and the Northwest Pacific, 19 and 14 records, respectively. Some introduction events were attributed to multiple possible pathways. For these introductions, vessels transferred the greatest number of aquatic NIS (39%) to the Arctic, followed by natural spread (30%) and aquaculture activities (25%). Similar trends were found for introductions attributed to a single pathway. The phyla Arthropoda and Ochrophyta had the highest number of recorded introduction events, with 19 and 12 records, respectively. Recommendations including vector management, horizon scanning, early detection, rapid response, and a pan-Arctic biodiversity inventory are considered in this paper. Our study provides a comprehensive record of primary introductions of NIS for marine environments in the circumpolar Arctic and identifies knowledge gaps and opportunities for NIS research and management. Ecosystems worldwide will face dramatic changes in the coming decades due to global change. Our findings contribute to the knowledge base needed to address two aspects of global change-invasive species and climate change.",2019,"JAN","Global Change Biology","25","1","25-38","WOS:000453370700004","10.1111/gcb.14469","","#2001","Chan 2019","Anabel Kinsey (2024-11-24 05:21:49)(Select): As we are including papers from the Arctic, this is definitely relevant; ","Biotic",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"5","The Decline and Impending Collapse of the Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) Population in the North Atlantic Ocean: A Review of Possible Causes","Dadswell, M.; Spares, A.; Reader, J.; McLean, M.; McDermott, T.; Samways, K.; Lilly, J.","Adult returns to many Atlantic salmon wild and hatchery stocks of the North Atlantic have declined or collapsed since 1985. Enhancement, commercial fishery closures, and angling restrictions have failed to halt the decline. Human impacts such as dams, pollution or marine overexploitation were responsible for some stock declines in the past, but adult returns to river and hatchery stocks with no obvious local impacts have also declined or collapsed since 1985. Multiple studies have postulated that the recent widespread occurrence of low adult returns may be caused by climate change, salmon farming, food availability at sea, or marine predators but these possibilities are unsupported by stocks that persist near historic levels, loss of stocks remote from farm sites, a diverse marine prey field, and scarcity of large offshore predators. The decline and collapse of stocks has common characteristics: 1) cyclic annual adult returns cease, 2) annual adult returns flatline, 3) adult mean size declines, and 4) stock collapses occurred earliest among watersheds distant from the North Atlantic Sub-polar Gyre (NASpG). Cyclic annual adult returns were common to all stocks in the past that were not impacted by anthropogenic changes to their natal streams. A flatline of adult abundance and reduction in adult mean size are common characteristics of many overexploited fish stocks and suggest illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fisheries exploitation at sea. Distance from the NASpG causing higher mortality of migrating post-smolts would increase the potential for collapse of these stocks from IUU exploitation. By-catch of post-smolts and adults in paired-trawl fisheries off Europe and intercept adult fisheries off Greenland, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and off Europe have been sources of marine mortality but seem unlikely to be the primary cause of the decline. Distribution in time and space of former, legal high-sea fisheries indicated fishers were well acquainted with the ocean migratory pattern of salmon and combined with lack of surveillance since 1985 outside Exclusive Economic Zones or in remote northern regions may mean high at-sea mortality occurs because of IUU fisheries. The problem of IUU ocean fisheries is acute, has collapsed numerous stocks of desired species worldwide, and is probably linked to the decline and impending collapse of the North Atlantic salmon population.",2022,"MAR 16","REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE & AQUACULTURE","30","2","215-258","WOS:000668774600001","10.1080/23308249.2021.1937044","","#2660","Dadswell 2022","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-30 12:40:25)(Select): Review paper indicates that climate change is not responsible for collapse of salmon fisheries """"In our opinion climate change

"6","Consequences of Shifts in Abundance and Distribution of American Chestnut for Restoration of a Foundation Forest Tree","Dalgleish, H. J.; Nelson, C. D.; Scrivani, J. A.; Jacobs, D. F.","Restoration of foundation species, such as the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) that was devastated by an introduced fungus, can restore ecosystem function. Understanding both the current distribution as well as biogeographic patterns is important for restoration planning. We used United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data to quantify the current density and distribution of C. dentata. We then review the literature concerning biogeographic patterns in C. dentata. Currently, 431 +/- 30.2 million stems remain. The vast majority (360 +/- 22 million) are sprouts <2.5 cm dbh. Although this number is approximately 10% of the estimated pre-blight population, blight has caused a major shift in the size structure. The current-day population has a larger range, particularly west and north, likely due to human translocation. While climate change could facilitate northward expansion, limited seed reproduction makes this unlikely without assisted migration. Previous research demonstrates that the current, smaller population contains slightly higher genetic diversity than expected, although little information exists on biogeographic patterns in the genetics of adaptive traits. Our research provides a baseline characterization of the contemporary population of C. dentata, to enable monitoring stem densities and range limits to support restoration efforts.",2016,"JAN","Forests","7","1","","WOS:000369493400009","10.3390/f7010004","","#2684","Dalgleish 2016","Anabel Kinsey (2024-11-24 05:05:33)(Select): Figure 1 shows expansion into Ontario, definitely transboundary ; ","Biotic; Intervention; Transboundary unclear",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

M.; Shook, K.; Demuth, M. N.; Pietroniro, A.","The interior of western Canada, like many similar cold mid- to high-latitude regions worldwide, is undergoing extensive and rapid climate and environmental change, which may accelerate in the coming decades. Understanding and predicting changes in coupled climate-land-hydrological systems are crucial to society yet limited by lack of understanding of changes in cold-region process responses and interactions, along with their representation in most current-generation land-surface and hydrological models. It is essential to consider the underlying processes and base predictive models on the proper physics, especially under conditions of non-stationarity where the past is no longer a reliable guide to the future and system trajectories can be unexpected. These challenges were forefront in the recently completed Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN), which assembled and focused a wide range of multi-disciplinary expertise to improve the understanding, diagnosis, and prediction of change over the cold interior of western Canada. CCRN advanced knowledge of fundamental cold-region ecological and hydrological processes through observation and experimentation across a network of highly instrumented research basins and other sites. Significant efforts were made to improve the functionality and process representation, based on this improved understanding, within the fine-scale Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform and the large-scale Modelisation Environmentale Communautaire (MEC) - Surface and Hydrology (MESH) model. These models were, and continue to be, applied under past and projected future climates and under current and expected future land and vegetation cover configurations to diagnose historical change and predict possible future hydrological responses. This second of two articles synthesizes the nature and understanding of cold-region processes and Earth system responses to future climate, as advanced by CCRN. These include changing precipitation and moisture feedbacks to the atmosphere; altered snow regimes, changing balance of snowfall and rainfall, and glacier loss; vegetation responses to climate and the loss of ecosystem resilience to wildfire and disturbance; thawing permafrost and its influence on landscapes and hydrology; groundwater storage and cycling and its connections to surface water; and stream and river discharge as influenced by the various drivers of hydrological change.

W.","Biological control of pests is a key feature of integrated pest management programmes in many agroecosystems. An assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on biological control is critical but challenging, because biological control depends on inter-wspecific interactions, which are generally complex. This chapter considers the potential effects of projected climate change on the biological control of insect pests, focusing on North American agricultural systems but involving principles that apply globally. The drivers of importance are projected rising surface temperatures, increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations and changes in the amount of and variability in precipitation. We consider how these climate change drivers could affect biological control by: (i) directly affecting the physiology or behaviour of biological control agents and/or pests; (ii) changing the overlap between species in space and time; and (iii) modifying interactions among multiple species involved in biological control within the agroecosystem. We illustrate with the few North American documented examples of the sensitivity of biological control to climate change, or with data that indicate such sensitivities exist. Effects of the first type include increases in the occurrence of temperatures that exceed the thermal optima of natural enemies, such as those that have been documented for coccinellids. Effects of the second type include changes in phenological overlap between insect pests and their natural enemies, illustrated best by a recent report involving the cereal leaf beetle and its principal parasitoid. Effects of the third type include climate-related changes in plant responses to herbivory that influence natural enemies, to the effects of climate on interacting predator assemblages and food webs. Although there is evidence for each of these types of effects, the literature remains sparse. More studies are needed, and we suggest a research agenda to improve understanding of the sensitivity of biological control to climate change.",2015,"","CLIMATE CHANGE AND INSECT PESTS","7","","119-135","WOS:000377029500008","10.1079/9781780643786.0000","","#3372","Eigenbrode 2015","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-06 11:06:29)(Select): Sanford sent me a copy (attached).

F.","The Arctic is one of the most rapidly changing places on Earth and it is a sentinel region for understanding the range and magnitude of planetary changes, and their impacts on ecosystems. However, our understanding of arctic coastal ecosystems remains limited, and the impacts of ongoing and future climate change on them are largely unexplored. Kelp forests are the dominant habitat along many rocky Arctic coastlines, providing structure and food for economically and ecologically important species. Here we synthesize existing information on the distribution and diversity of arctic kelp forests and assess how ongoing changes in environmental conditions could impact the extent, productivity, and resilience of these important ecosystems. We identify regions where the range and growth of arctic kelp are likely to undergo rapid short-term increase due to reduced sea ice cover, increased light, and warming. However, we also describe areas where kelps could be negatively impacted by rising freshwater input and coastal erosion due to receding sea ice and melting permafrost. In some regions, arctic kelp forests have undergone sudden regime shifts due to altered ecological interactions or changing environmental conditions. Key knowledge gaps for arctic kelp forests include measures of extent and diversity of kelp communities (especially northern Canada and northeastern Russia), the faunal communities supported by many of these habitats, and the role of arctic kelp forests in structuring nearby pelagic and benthic food webs. Filling in these gaps and strategically prioritizing research in areas of rapid environmental change will enable more effective management of these important habitats, and better predictions of future changes in the coastal ecosystems they support and the services that they provide.",2019,"JAN","Global and Planetary Change","172","","1-14","WOS:000456222800001","10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.09.005","","#3749","Filbee-Dexter 2019","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-12 09:59:28)(Select): There is a paragraph towards the end on expected northward shifts in kelp species with climate change, so potential flow = kelp.

Many local-scale studies have generated important findings regarding the physiology, responses, and risks associated with shifts in plant phenology. By comparison, our understanding of regional- and global-scale phenology has been largely limited to remote sensing of green-up without the ability to differentiate among plant species. However, a new generation of analytical tools and data sources-including enhanced remote sensing products, digitized herbarium specimen data, and public participation in science-now permits investigating patterns and drivers of phenology across extensive taxonomic, temporal, and spatial scales, in an emerging field that we call macrophenology. Recent studies have highlighted how phenology affects dynamics at broad scales, including species interactions and ranges, carbon fluxes, and climate. At the cusp of this developing field of study, we review the theoretical and practical advances in four primary areas of plant macrophenology: (1) global patterns and shifts in plant phenology, (2) within-species changes in phenology as they mediate species' range limits and invasions at the regional scale, (3) broad-scale variation in phenology among species leading to ecological mismatches, and (4) interactions between phenology and global ecosystem processes.

"12","Impact of climate change and other factors on emerging arbovirus diseases","Gould, E. A.; Higgs, S.","While some sceptics remain unconvinced that global climate change is a reality,there is no doubt that during the past 50 years or so, patterns of emerging arbovirus diseases have changed significantly. Can this be attributed to climate change? Climate is a major factor in determining: (1) the geographic and temporal distribution of arthropods; (2) characteristics of arthropod life cycles; (3) dispersal patterns of associated arboviruses; (4) the evolution of arboviruses; and (5) the efficiency with which they are transmitted from arthropods to vertebrate hosts. Thus, under the influence of increasing temperatures and rainfall through warming of the oceans, and alteration of the natural cycles that stabilise climate, one is inevitably drawn to the conclusion that arboviruses will continue to emerge in new regions. For example, we cannot ignore the unexpected but successful establishment of chikungunya fever in northern Itaty, the sudden appearance of West Nile virus in North America, the increasing frequency of Rift Valley fever epidemics in the Arabian Peninsula, and very recently, the emergence of Btuetongue virus in northern Europe. In this brief review we ask the question, are these diseases emerging because of climate change or do other factors play an equal or even more important rote in their emergence?

"13","Analysis of Invasive Insects: Links to Climate Change","Gutierrez, A. P.; Ponti, L.","Climate change is expected to alter the geographic distribution and abundance of many species, to increase the invasion of new areas by exotic species and, in some cases, to lead to species extinction. This chapter reviews some of the links between invasive insects and climate change. The effects of climate change on insect pest populations can be direct, through impacts on their physiology and behaviour, or indirect, through biotic interactions (i.e. bottom-up and top-down effects). Anthropogenic climate and global change is expected to be a major driver in the introduction, establishment, distribution, impact and changes in the efficacy of mitigation strategies for invasive species. To address these problems, we must be able to predict climate change impacts on species distribution and abundance. Commonly used ecological niche model ling approaches have implicit assumptions about the biology of the target species and attempt to characterize the ecological niche using aggregate weather and other factors in the area of recorded distribution.

"14","Species Introductions and Their Cascading Impacts on Biotic Interactions in desert riparian ecosystems","Hultine, K. R.; Bean, D. W.; Dudley, T. L.; Gehring, C. A.","Synopsis Desert riparian ecosystems of North America are hotspots of biodiversity that support many sensitive species, and are in a region experiencing some of the highest rates of climatic alteration in North America. Fremont cottonwood, Populus fremontii, is a foundation tree species of this critical habitat, but it is threatened by global warming and regional drying, and by a non-native tree/shrub, Tamarix spp., all of which can disrupt the mutualism between P. fremontii and its beneficial mycorrhizal fungal communities. Specialist herbivorous leaf beetles (Diorhabda spp.) introduced for biocontrol of Tamarix are altering the relationship between this shrub and its environment. Repeated episodic feeding on Tamarix foliage by Diorhabda results in varying rates of dieback and mortality, depending on genetic variation in allocation of resources, growing conditions, and phenological synchrony between herbivore and host plant. In this article, we review the complex interaction between climatic change and species introductions and their combined impacts on P. fremontii and their associated communities. We anticipate that (1) certain genotypes of P. fremontii will respond more favorably to the presence of Tamarix and to climatic change due to varying selection pressures to cope with competition and stress; (2) the ongoing evolution of Diorhabda's life cycle timing will continue to facilitate its expansion in North America, and will over time enhance herbivore impact to Tamarix; (3) defoliation by Diorhabda will reduce the negative impact of Tamarix on P. fremontii associations with mycorrhizal fungi; and (4) spatial variability in climate and climatic change will modify the capacity for Tamarix to survive episodic defoliation by Diorhabda, thereby altering the relationship between Tamarix and P. fremontii, and its associated mycorrhizal fungal communities. Given the complex biotic/abiotic interactions outlined in this review, conservation biologists and riparian ecosystem managers should strive to identify and conserve the phenotypic traits that underpin tolerance and resistance to stressors such as climate change and species invasion. Such efforts will greatly enhance conservation restoration efficacy for protecting P. fremontii forests and their associated communities.",2015,"OCT","Integrative and Comparative Biology","55","4","587-601","WOS:000362672100004","10.1093/icb/icv019","","#5395","Hultine 2015","","Biotic",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

R.; Greenwood, G.; Mark, B. G.; Milner, A. M.; Weingartner, R.; Winder, M.","The cryosphere in mountain regions is rapidly declining, a trend that is expected to accelerate over the next several decades due to anthropogenic climate change. A cascade of effects will result, extending from mountains to lowlands with associated impacts on human livelihood, economy, and ecosystems. With rising air temperatures and increased radiative forcing, glaciers will become smaller and, in some cases, disappear, the area of frozen ground will diminish, the ratio of snow to rainfall will decrease, and the timing and magnitude of both maximum and minimum streamflow will change. These changes will affect erosion rates, sediment, and nutrient flux, and the biogeochemistry of rivers and proglacial lakes, all of which influence water quality, aquatic habitat, and biotic communities. Changes in the length of the growing season will allow low-elevation plants and animals to expand their ranges upward. Slope failures due to thawing alpine permafrost, and outburst floods from glacier-and moraine-dammed lakes will threaten downstream populations.Societies even well beyond the mountains depend on meltwater from glaciers and snow for drinking water supplies, irrigation, mining, hydropower, agriculture, and recreation.

R.; Kays, R.; McShea, W.; Pacifici, K.; Rooney, B.; Kierepka, E.","AimSynthesize literature on genetic structure within species to understand how geographic features and species traits influence past responses to climate change.LocationNorth America.Time PeriodWe synthesized phylogeographic studies from 1978 to 2023, which describe genetic lineages that diverged during the Pleistocene (>= 11,700 years ago).Major Taxa StudiedMammals.MethodsWe conducted a literature review to map genetic breaks in species distributions, then tested a set of geographic hypotheses (e.g., mountains, rivers) to explain their position by comparing break locations to a grid within each species' sampled range using logistic regression. We then conducted a meta-analysis using species-specific model estimates to ask if life-history traits explained variation in which barriers were most important in species' past response to climate change.ResultsOur findings reveal heterogeneity in both where North American mammal phylogeography has been studied and the density of genetic breaks across 229 species. We found relatively high concordance among carnivores, ungulates and lagomorphs, where breaks were associated with mountains, major water bodies and relatively even terrain. In contrast, we found high variability within rodents and shrews, and no evidence that intrinsic factors related to dispersal ability explained the importance of hypothesized barriers across all species.Main ConclusionsSouthern Mexico is a hotspot for genetic breaks that has yet to be integrated into the broader story of North American phylogeography. We show that mountains and major water bodies play particularly important roles as barriers, but substantial variation across species within orders suggests that there is more to the story besides shared climatic or phylogenetic histories. Thus, understanding the phylogeography of individual species will continue to be important given that our results suggest high variability in how species may respond to future global change.",2024,"2024 JUN 6","Global Ecology and Biogeography","","","","WOS:001239162000001","10.1111/geb.13875","","#5704","Jensen 2024","","Biotic",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

A warming climate will have large effects on lakes of the Boreal Shield. Our ability to forecast these effects, however, is hampered by a very incomplete understanding of the actual interactions between weather and many aspects of lake ecosystems. Climate change will affect lakes in very complex ways. Changing weather conditions will have direct effects on thermal habitats; however, there will also be very important indirect effects on lake ecosystems through influences on watershed processes that affect the thermal and chemical characteristics of lakes. Altered habitat conditions will affect the resident biota in both positive and negative ways and may favour range expansions of some native and non-native species. Our understanding of the altered biological interactions that will structure lake communities in a warmer climate is still limited, making the prediction of biological outcomes very difficult. Modelling efforts, experiments and empirical analyses of relationships between important attributes of lakes, lake communities, and weather conditions in the past are beginning to further our ability to predict likely future effects. Much more work is needed in all these research areas to further our understanding of the probable effects of climate change on Boreal Shield lakes.

A growing body of research suggests that environmental change driven by increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and ocean is unfolding more rapidly in New England than elsewhere, and is an important factor in the failure of these stocks to respond to management. We reviewed research on effects of changes in temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and ocean currents on pelagic life stages, post-settlement life stages, and reproduction of four species in the New England groundfish fishery: Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), and yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea). The volume of research on cod was nearly equal to that on the other three species combined. Similarly, many more studies examined effects of temperature than other factors. The majority of studies suggest adverse outcomes, with less evidence for mixed or positive effects. However, for all of the factors other than temperature, there are more knowledge gaps than known effects. Importantly, most work to date examines impacts in isolation, but effects might combine in nonlinear ways and cause stronger reductions in stock productivity than expected.

As a result, Johnsongrass has reduced native plant diversity in grasslands and inflicted economic damage to agriculture on every continent. Johnsongrass is a growing threat to crop production, as it serves as a refuge for a variety of agricultural pests and plant viral diseases. Over the past decades, herbicides extensively applied to control Johnsongrass have boosted selection pressure, resulting in the independent evolution of herbicide-resistant ecotypes across multiple locations.

J.","The round goby Neogobius melanostomus is one of the most wide-ranging invasive fish on earth, with substantial introduced populations within the Laurentian Great Lakes watershed, the Baltic Sea and several major European rivers. Rapid expansion and deleterious ecosystem effects have motivated extensive research on this species; here this research is synthesized. Maps of the global distribution are provided and the invasion history of N. melanostomus, which spread more rapidly at first in North America, but has undergone substantial expansion over the past decade in the Baltic Sea, is summarized. Meta-analyses comparing their size at age, diet, competitors and predators in North American and European ecosystems are provided. Size at age is region specific, with saline habitats typically supporting larger and faster growing individuals than fresh water. Neogobius melanostomus prey differs substantially between regions, demonstrating a capacity to adapt to locally abundant food sources. Neogobius melanostomus comprise at least 50% of the diet of eight taxa in at least one site or life stage; in total, 16 predator taxa are documented from the Laurentian Great Lakes v. five from Eurasia. Invasive N. melanostomus are the only common forage fish to heavily exploit mussels in the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea, facilitating the transfer of energy from mussels to higher trophic levels in both systems. Neogobius melanostomus morphology, life history, reproduction, habitat preferences, environmental tolerances, parasites, environmental effects, sampling strategies and management are also discussed. Neogobius melanostomus inhabit a wide range of temperate freshwater and brackish-water ecosystems and will probably continue to spread via ballast water, accidental bait release and natural dispersal worldwide. Climate change will probably enhance N. melanostomus expansion by elevating water temperatures closer to its energetic optimum of 26 degrees C. Future research needs are presented; most pressing are evaluating the economic effects of N. melanostomus invasion, determining long-term population level effects of egg predation on game-fish recruitment and comparing several variables (density, ecological effects morphology and life history) among invaded ecosystems.

We drew on existing research and local knowledge to examine potential effects of climate change, petroleum development, tourism, and government spending cutbacks on the sustainability of four Arctic villages. We used data across eight disciplines to develop an Arctic Community Synthesis Model and a Web-based, interactive Possible Futures Model. Results suggested that climate warming will increase vegetation biomass within the herd's summer range. However, despite forage increasing, the herd was projected as likely to decline with a warming climate because of increased insect harassment in the summer and potentially greater winter snow depths. There was a strong negative correlation between hypothetical, development-induced displacement of cows and calves from utilized calving grounds and calf survival during June. The results suggested that climate warming coupled with petroleum development would cause a decline in caribou harvest by local communities. Because the Synthesis Model inherits uncertainties associated with each component model, sensitivity analysis is required.

Through our analysis we found that 62% of the rivers examined in the deserts of the U.S. and Mexico have had just one study over the past four decades and 67% of studies used qualitative methods. Furthermore, only one-third of the 312 species catalogued in our work have been studied more than once and only 5% have been considered five or more times. The most common risks or stressors to riparian and aquatic species were engineered structures, invasive species, and altered flows; and while 10% of studies included climate stressor, climate change impacts were infrequently examined. Ultimately, we found that although research has been conducted across the desert watersheds of the U.S. and Mexico, there are significant gaps in our knowledge of basic data such as the location and extent of perennial and intermittent streams, let alone studies of environmental flow needs.

M.; Shanmugam, H.; Taghian, G.; van de Water, Jajm; Vezzulli, L.; Weihe, P.; Zeka, A.; Raps, H.; Rampal, P.","Background: Pollution - unwanted waste released to air, water, and land by human activity - is the largest environmental cause of disease in the world today. It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood. Goals: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health. Methods: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention. Environmental Findings: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources - coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths. Ecosystem Findings: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks. Human Health Findings: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children's risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals - phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste - can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South - environmental injustice on a planetary scale. Conclusions: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth's resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted. Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored. Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries. Recommendations: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health. Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress. Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries. Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.",2020,"","ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH","86","1","","WOS:000595376400001","10.5334/aogh.2831","","#6701","Landrigan 2020","Elliott Parsons (2024-10-31 12:53:02)(Select): paper is a review, looks at intersection of ocean pollution and climate change - flows include ocean water (gyres), and air (distributing air pollution).

M.","The IPCC 4th Assessment Report(FAR)is considered in light of Holocene palaeo-records of Arctic and Subarctic land temperatures and the response of the boreal forest-tundra boundary to past and present warming. The palaeo-records appear to support and amplify some of the conclusions in FAR and raise questions about others. Comparison of the FAR estimates for late 21st-century warming with Arctic and Subarctic palaeoclimatic records suggests that anticipated future warming will be unprecedented compared to earlier Holocene warming including the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) and subsequent Medieval Warm Period (MWP). Annual warming and winter warming will likely be greater than during earlier periods in the Holocene, but summer temperatures projected by FAR may approximate or not far exceed the summer warming of the HTM. The geographically synchronous pattern of 21st-century warming projected by FAR will differ from the observed geographic variability in the timing of the HTM, particularly in the western Arctic. Further palaeo-record syntheses are required to fully delineate the similarities and differences between the HTM and the projected conditions of the 21 st century. In addition, palaeo-records suggest that the Arctic and Subarctic climate may be sensitive to relatively small changes in solar irradiance and understanding the potential effects of natural variations in irradiance on the future climate of the Arctic and Subarctic remains a question deserving further research. FAR mapped estimates of a significant northward displacement of boreal forest and woodland clue to warming imply that boreal forest or woodland will displace tundra as far north as the Arctic coastline by AD 2100. In Eurasia the estimated AD 2100 location of the tree line appears to approximate the HTM location. In North America an advance of forest to the coastline on the north slope of Alaska, central Canada and northern Quebec would far outdistance the relatively limited northward advances of boreal forest during the HTM. However, rates of tree species advance and subsequent forest development based on palaeo-records and Currently observed tree line advances raise questions about the likelihood that northward migration and subsequent increases in the population sizes of boreal tree species could occur rapidly enough to establish continuous forest and woodland as far north as the Arctic coastlines of Eurasia and North America by AD 2100. Determining potential rates of northward advance of the northern forests requires further ecological and palaeoecological investigations.

"26","Implications of climate change for parasitism of animals in the aquatic environment","Marcogliese, D. J.","Climate change can occur over evolutionary and ecological time scales as a result of natural and anthropogenic causes. Considerable attention has been focused in recent years on the biological consequences of global warming. However, aside from studies on those deleterious parasites that cause disease in man, little effort has been dedicated to understanding the potential changes in the parasite fauna of animal populations, especially those in aquatic systems. Predictions using General Circulation Models, among others, are examined in terms of their consequences for parasite populations in freshwater and marine ecosystems, concentrating on the temperate and boreal regions of eastern North America. Biological effects due to global warming are not predictable simply in terms of temperature response. It is also essential to explore the effects on aquatic parasites of alterations in host distribution, water levels, eutrophication, stratification, ice cover, acidification, oceanic currents, ultraviolet-light penetration, weather extremes, and human interference. Evaluation of the potential response of parasites of aquatic organisms to climate change illustrates the complexity of host-parasite systems and the difficulty of making accurate predictions for biological systems. Parasites in aquatic systems will respond directly to changes in temperature but also indirectly to changes in other abiotic parameters that are mediated indirectly through changes in the distribution and abundance of their hosts. Local extirpations and introductions may be expected as a result. In the long term, climatic change may influence selection of different life-history traits, affecting parasite transmission and, potentially, virulence.",2001,"AUG","Canadian Journal of Zoology","79","8","1331-1352","WOS:000171013200001","10.1139/cjz-79-8-1331","","#7768","Marcogliese 2001","Elliott Parsons (2024-10-30 15:59:06)(Select): Yes review paper, climate change included, listed flows include biotic flows - movement of diseases, invasive species, biodiversity is highlighted, yes within NA, and yes, Canada/US areas are mentioned a few times; ","Biophysical",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

G.; Hinch, S. G.; Cooke, S. J.; Patterson, D. A.","Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) is one of the most iconic and valued species of Pacific salmon. Various studies have examined the potential effects of future climate change on sockeye salmon, but there is currently no synthesis of the documented effects of climate on this species. In this paper, we present a synthesis of 80 peer-reviewed publications in the English language evaluating the effects of climate on sockeye salmon growth, phenology, and survival. The great majority of studies examined have been conducted with stocks from North America (90 % of studies). Survival (55 %) has been the most frequently studied aspect of the sockeye salmon life history in relation to climate, followed by growth (45 %) and phenology (30 %), with temperature (83.4 %) being the climate-related variable most frequently examined in such studies. Across life stages, the effects of climate-related variables have been most frequently studied on fry (36.3 %) and least studied on spawners (7.5 %). Our synthesis revealed that associations between temperature and growth, phenology, or survival have been uncovered for all the life stages of sockeye salmon, whereas relationships with other climate-related variables have been sparse. There is substantial evidence that sockeye salmon are influenced by thermal conditions experienced at regional, rather than ocean- or continental-wide scales, and that responses to temperature vary among and within stocks. The mechanisms by which climate affect sockeye salmon during the early stages in freshwater and while at sea are still poorly understood and warrant future research. More research on the effects of non-temperature, climate-related variables (e.g. stream flow, ocean pH), inter-generational and carry-over effects of climate, interaction between climate and non-climate stressors, and adaptation to climate change are also needed.

The Arctic and Antarctic regions are extremely sensitive to climate change and have displayed profound and variable changes over recent decades, including decreases in sea ice extent, greening of tundra, and changes to hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. It is unclear how polar-adapted arthropods will respond to such changes, though many are expected to be at great risk of extinction. Here, we review the adaptive mechanisms that allow polar arthropods to persist in extreme environments and discuss how the effects of climate change at the poles will likely favour non-native species or those with the ability to rapidly evolve and/or acclimate. We find that physiological, behavioural, plastic, and genetic data are limited in scope for polar arthropods and research on adaptive responses to change is scarce. This restricts our ability to predict how they may respond to a warming climate.

J.","Global climate change has led to profound alterations of the Arctic environment and ecosystems, with potential sec-ondary effects on mercury (Hg) within Arctic biota. This review presents the current scientific evidence for impacts of direct physical climate change and indirect ecosystem change on Hg exposure and accumulation in Arctic terrestrial, freshwater, and marine organisms. As the marine environment is elevated in Hg compared to the terrestrial environ-ment, terrestrial herbivores that now exploit coastal/marine foods when terrestrial plants are iced over may be ex-posed to higher Hg concentrations. Conversely, certain populations of predators, including Arctic foxes and polar bears, have shown lower Hg concentrations related to reduced sea ice-based foraging and increased land-based forag-ing. How climate change influences Hg in Arctic freshwater fishes is not clear, but for lacustrine populations it may depend on lake-specific conditions, including interrelated alterations in lake ice duration, turbidity, food web length and energy sources (benthic to pelagic), and growth dilution. In several marine mammal and seabird species, tissue Hg concentrations have shown correlations with climate and weather variables, including climate oscillation indices and sea ice trends; these findings suggest that wind, precipitation, and cryosphere changes that alter Hg transport and deposition are impacting Hg concentrations in Arctic marine organisms. Ecological changes, including northward range shifts of sub-Arctic species and altered body condition, have also been shown to affect Hg levels in some populations of Arctic marine species. Given the limited number of populations and species studied to date, especially within Arctic terrestrial and freshwater systems, further research is needed on climate-driven processes influencing Hg concentrations in Arctic ecosystems and their net effects.

The decline of amphibian populations as a result of the effect of this pathogen occurred simultaneously in various parts of the world from the early 1980's. In Mexico the epidemic wave of Bd was identified in the 1970's, which is consistent with the decline of salamander (caudate) populations in the southern part of the country. Our work presents a review of the state of knowledge of chytridiomycosis as a factor in the decline of amphibian populations worldwide and the information gathered until now of the presence of this pathogen in Mexico. To date, there has been infection in 50 Mexican amphibian species that are mainly distributed in the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico, and was determined that the families Hylidae and Plethodontidae are the most affected. Several authors have suggested that global climate change has played a key role in the occurrence and virulence of Batrachochytrium because the temperature increase induces an imbalance in the pathogen-host relationship to increased virulence of Bd and / or increased susceptibility to infection in amphibians. On this matter, we analyzed the reported temperatures of 1964-1989 in areas where the decline of caudates was more drastic. We found no relationship between the decline of salamanders with temperature.

This unifies an otherwise sparse and disconnected literature, providing a starting point for further discussion by academics and policymakers. Potential interventions include cloud seeding, using pipes to inject cool water into cyclone hotspots, injecting particles into the upper atmosphere and atmospheric aerosol injections. Approaches have different logistical requirements, side effects and promise. Understanding the effectiveness and associated risks of different interventions will inform prudent cyclone risk management and research. Our review points to the promise of aerosol injection and high-altitude particle injection as first research directions.

Microparasites selected for enhanced virulence in culture settings should be less successful maintaining infectivity in wild populations, as once the host dies, there are limited opportunities to infect new individuals. Instead, moderately virulent microparasites persisting for long periods across multiple environments are of greatest concern. Evolved resistance to endemic microparasites may reduce susceptibilities, but as barriers to microparasite distributions are weakened, and environments become more stressful, unexposed populations may be impacted and pathogenicity enhanced. We provide an overview of the evolutionary and ecological impacts of infectious diseases in wild salmon and suggest ways in which modern technologies can elucidate the microparasites of greatest potential import. We present four case studies that resolve microparasite impacts on adult salmon migration success, impact of river warming on microparasite replication, and infection status on susceptibility to predation.

G.; Massa, M. L.; Cohen, E. B.","Birds must contend with an array of anthropogenic threats during their migratory journeys. Many migrants are killed due to encounters with artificial light, introduced species, pollutants, and other anthropogenic hazards, while survivors of these encounters can suffer longer-lasting negative effects. The nonlethal effects of anthropogenic threats on migrating birds are less well understood than direct mortality, yet both potentially contribute to population declines. For example, building collisions frequently kill migrating birds, but the numbers of migrants that survive with an impaired ability to fly, refuel, or navigate to their destination on time is not well understood. Though not immediately fatal, such injuries can lead to delayed mortality and, ultimately, reduced lifetime reproductive success. Furthermore, migrants are likely to encounter multiple threats on their journeys, which can interact synergistically to further reduce fitness. For instance, light pollution attracts and disorients migrants, increasing the likelihood of window strikes, and surviving birds may be more vulnerable to predation from introduced predators. While considerable attention has focused on the lethal effects of anthropogenic threats, here, we review nonlethal effects of eight types of threats during migration, their interactions, and the pathways through which they can exert fitness costs. In doing so, we identify knowledge gaps and suggest areas for future research. In the absence of more information, we propose that the greatest reduction in the cumulative lethal and nonlethal impacts of anthropogenic hazards will be achieved by addressing threat types, like artificial light at night, that interact with and compound the impact of additional threats. Direct mortality from anthropogenic sources is recognized as a key driver of population declines, but a full understanding of the impacts of human activity on migrating birds must include the cumulative and interacting effects that extend beyond immediate mortality en route to influence overall migration success and lifetime fitness. Lay Summary & BULL; Migrating birds around the world face a wide variety of threats from human activity and many species are declining significantly. & BULL; Many migrants are killed by these threats, while those exposed but not immediately killed may experience changes in their condition, migration timing, orientation, or route. & BULL; Nonlethal effects of threats during migration, such as sensory pollutants and introduced species, have not been well-studied but are likely contributing to population declines by lowering future survival or reproduction. & BULL; We review support for the nonlethal impacts of eight anthropogenic threats, describe how they can cause nonlethal fitness costs for migrating birds, and identify knowledge gaps. & BULL; Reducing threats that compound the impacts of other threats, such as artificial light at night, will help to minimize the cumulative impacts on migratory birds. & BULL; Fully capturing the costs of human activity on migratory birds requires understanding both lethal and nonlethal impacts of encounters with anthropogenic threats during migration.",2023,"AUG 11","ORNITHOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","125","3","","WOS:001027469400001","10.1093/ornithapp/duad020","","#8801","Nemes 2023","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-11-22 07:04:41)(Select): study does not specifically focus on North America but could be relevant for understanding global climate change impacts on migratory bird populations ;","Biotic; Potentially relevant; Transboundary unclear; save for other sections",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE

In North America, decreases in the frequency and intensity of extreme winter cold events are expected to allow the poleward range expansion of many cold-sensitive tropical organisms, sometimes at the expense of temperate organisms. Although ecologists have long noted the critical ecological role of winter cold temperature extremes in tropical-temperate transition zones, the ecological effects of extreme cold events have been understudied, and the influence of warming winter temperatures has too often been left out of climate change vulnerability assessments. Here, we examine the influence of extreme cold events on the northward range limits of a diverse group of tropical organisms, including terrestrial plants, coastal wetland plants, coastal fishes, sea turtles, terrestrial reptiles, amphibians, manatees, and insects. For these organisms, extreme cold events can lead to major physiological damage or landscape-scale mass mortality. Conversely, the absence of extreme cold events can foster population growth, range expansion, and ecological regime shifts. We discuss the effects of warming winters on species and ecosystems in tropical-temperate transition zones.

Global mean temperature could increase by 1.5-4.5 degrees C or more over historic levels, and extreme weather eventsdrought, storms, and floodingare likely to increase greatly in frequency. Although ecologists and foresters agree that the practice of forestry will be transformed under climate change, these uncertainties compound the challenge of achieving sustainable, adaptive forest management. In this aritcle, we (i) present a multidisciplinary synthesis of current knowledge of responses of temperate and boreal tree species and forest communities to climate change, and (ii) outline silvicultural strategies for adapting temperate and boreal forests to confront climate change. Our knowledge synthesis proceeds through critical appraisals of efforts to model future tree distributions and responses to climate change, and reviews physiological, phenological, acclimation, and epigenetic responses to climate. As is the case of climate change itself, there are numerous uncertainties about tree species and provenance responses to climate change. For example, acclimation of respiration and epigenetic conditioning of seed embryos has the potential to buffer species against limited warming. Provenances within species also display idiosyncratic responses to altered climates, implying that soemm varieties will be more resilient or resistant to climate change than others. Genetically determined limits to climatic tolerance, and the limits of tree community resistance and resilience (speed of recovery from disturbance) in the face of climate-related disturbances are largely unknown. These unknowns require managers to adopt a portfolio of silvicultural strategies, which may range from minor modifications of current practices to design of novel multi-species stands that may have no historical analogue.

Lobatae) are a taxonomic group of hardwood trees, which occur in swamp forests, subtropical chaparral and savannahs from Columbia to Canada. They cover a wide range of ecological niches, and many species are thought to be able to cope with current trends in climate change. Genus Quercus encompasses ca. 500 species, of which ca. 80 make up sect. Lobatae. Species diversity is greatest within the southeastern USA and within the northern and eastern regions of Mexico. This review discusses the weak reproductive barriers between species of red oaks and the effects this has on speciation and niche range. Distribution and diversity have been shaped by drought adaptations common to the species of sect. Lobatae, which enable them to fill various xeric niches across the continent. Drought adaptive traits of this taxonomic group include deciduousness, deep tap roots, ring-porous xylem, regenerative stump sprouting, greater leaf thickness and smaller stomata. The complex interplay between these anatomical and morphological traits has given red oaks features of drought tolerance and avoidance. Here, we discuss physiological and genetic components of these adaptations to address how many species of sect. Lobatae reside within xeric sites and/or sustain normal metabolic function during drought. Although extensive drought adaptation appears to give sect. Lobatae a resilience to climate change, aging tree stands, oak life history traits and the current genetic structures place many red oak species at risk. Furthermore, oak decline, a complex interaction between abiotic and biotic agents, has severe effects on red oaks and is likely to accelerate species decline and fragmentation. We suggest that assisted migration can be used to avoid species fragmentation and increase climate change resilience of sect.

"41","Climate change impacts on fire regimes and key ecosystem services in Rocky Mountain forests","Rocca, M. E.; Brown, P. M.; MacDonald, L. H.; Carrico, C. M.","Forests and woodlands in the central Rocky Mountains span broad gradients in climate, elevation, and other environmental conditions, and therefore encompass a great diversity of species, ecosystem productivities, and fire regimes. The objectives of this review are: (1) to characterize the likely short- and longer-term effects of projected climate changes on fuel dynamics and fire regimes for four generalized forest types in the Rocky Mountain region; (2) to review how these changes are likely to affect carbon sequestration, water resources, air quality, and biodiversity; and (3) to assess the suitability of four different management alternatives to mitigate these effects and maintain forest ecosystem services. Current climate projections indicate that temperatures will increase in every season; forecasts for precipitation are less certain but suggest that the northern part of the region but not the southern part will experience higher annual precipitation. The increase in temperatures will result in a greater proportion of winter precipitation falling as rain, earlier spring snowmelt, and a consequential increase in the length and severity of fire seasons. Fire frequency is likely to increase in the short term in all areas because of the warmer, longer, and drier fire seasons, but this change is likely to lead to a longer-term reduction in vegetation productivity in some of the most moisture-limited forest types, such as pH-ion-juniper and lower montane. This will decrease fuel accumulation rates and consequently reduce fire risk and result in longer fire return intervals. We consider four main management alternatives: fire suppression, wildfire (no intervention), prescribed fire, and mechanical thinning. The paper summarizes the effects of these treatments on forest ecosystem services, showing that they vary widely by forest type. This broad-scale assessment provides general guidance for forest managers and policy makers, and identifies more specific research needs on how climate-driven changes in fuel production and forest conditions will affect impact the four main forest ecosystems across the central Rocky Mountain region.

T.","Model systems in biology expand the research capacity of individuals and the community. Closely related to Arabidopsis, the genus Boechera has emerged as an important ecological model owing to the ability to integrate across molecular, functional, and eco-evolutionary approaches. Boechera species are broadly distributed in relatively undisturbed habitats predominantly in western North America and provide one of the few experimental systems for identification of ecologically important genes through genome-wide association studies and investigations of selection with plants in their native habitats. The ecologically, evolutionarily, and agriculturally important trait of apomixis (asexual reproduction via seeds) is common in the genus, and field experiments suggest that abiotic and biotic environments shape the evolution of sex. To date, population genetic studies have focused on the widespread species B. stricta, detailing population divergence and demographic history. Molecular and ecological studies show that balancing selection maintains genetic variation in similar to 10% of the genome, and ecological trade-offs contribute to complex trait variation for herbivore resistance, flowering phenology, and drought tolerance. Microbiome analyses have shown that host genotypes influence leaf and root microbiome composition, and the soil microbiome influences flowering phenology and natural selection. Furthermore, Boechera offers numerous opportunities for investigating biological responses to global change. In B. stricta, climate change has induced a shift of >2 weeks in the timing of first flowering since the 1970s, altered patterns of natural selection, generated maladaptation in previously locally-adapted populations, and disrupted life history trade-offs.

A.","Global climate change has already caused local declines and extinctions. These losses are generally thought to occur because climate change is progressing too rapidly for populations to keep pace. Based on this hypothesis, numerous predictive frameworks have been developed to project future range shifts and changes in population dynamics resulting from global climate change. However, recent empirical work has demonstrated that seasonally asynchronous climate change regimes - when a region is warming during some parts of the year, but cooling in others - are constraining species' responses to climate change more strongly than rapid warming, leading to intra-specific variation in responses to climate change and local population declines. Here, we couple a review of the literature related to asynchronous climate change regimes with meta-population simulations and an analysis of long-term North American climate trends to show that seasonally asynchronous regimes are occurring throughout most of North America and that their current spatial distribution may be a strong barrier to dispersal and gene flow across many species' ranges. Thus, even though adaptation to climate change may potentially be more common and rapid than previously thought, species whose ranges overlap with asynchronous regimes will likely succumb to local declines that may be difficult to mitigate via dispersal. Future climate-related predictive frameworks should therefore incorporate asynchronous regimes as well as more traditional measures of climate velocity in order to fully capture the array of potential future climate change scenarios.",2018,"NOV","Ecography","41","9","1428-1440","WOS:000443303200002","10.1111/ecog.03234","","#10992","Senner 2018","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-14 13:03:58)(Select): Paper is a review but also an original research study - climate impacts yes, flow yes (migratory birds), the biodiversity impact is to the populations of the migratory birds (Hudsonian godwit) - which has a phenological mismatch due to climate change.

Here, the spatial ecology of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.), managed as four stocks in the Northwest Atlantic, is reviewed. Halibut collapsed under high exploitation in the mid-19th century, but the Canadian fisheries value has increased seven-fold since the early 2000s. Atlantic halibut's thermal habitat has increased due to warming, possibly contributing to its expansion. Genomic evidence differentiates two populations in the four management units, whereas there is non-genetic spatial structure within each of the stock boundaries. There are different core juvenile areas and a diversity of spawning migration patterns influenced by timing, fish size, maturity state, and distance between summer-feeding and over-wintering habitats. From tagging studies, multiple estimates of median distance at recapture (similar to 3-90 km) are much less than the spatial domain of each stock. Growth rates are faster in the warmer south, as predicted by growing degree day. The current perspective of Atlantic halibut spatial structure is that there are two distinct populations, and within each, there are subpopulations composed of multiple migratory contingents.

Empirical data on the impact of climate change on bats are a cause for concern as current increases in global temperature are one fifth, or less, of those expected over the next century. We review observed impacts of climate change on bats and identify risk factors allowing species-specific predictions. The impact on species is reviewed in relation to six aspects, namely foraging, roosting, reproduction, biogeography, extreme weather events and indirect effects of climate change. For some aspects of species' ecology, there are insufficient data available to make accurate assessment of impacts. We identify seven risk factors encompassing three broad aspects: biogeography - small range size, high latitude or high altitude range and a range occupying a geographic area likely to become water stressed; foraging niche - frugivory and species restricted to aerial hawking; dispersal ability - species with restricted dispersal behaviour. We use the European and north-west African bats as a case study to assess the relative risk of climate change to individual species. Risk scores are compared with existing International Union for Conservation of Nature conservation assessments providing further insight into the conservation outlook for individual species.

Here, we conducted the first species-specific assessment of future climate change impacts on North American bumblebee distributions, using the most recent global change scenarios developed in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We assessed potential shifts in bumblebee species distributions with models generated using Maxent. We tested different assumptions about bumblebee species' dispersal capacities, drawing on observed patterns of range shifts to date, dispersal rates observed for bumblebee queens, and, lastly, assuming unlimited dispersal. Models show significant contractions of current ranges even under scenarios in which dispersal rates were high. Results suggest that dispersal rates may not suffice for bumblebees to track climate change as rapidly as required under any IPCC scenario for future climate change. Areas where species losses are projected overlap for many species and climate scenarios, and are concentrated in eastern parts of the continent. Models also show overlap for range expansions across many species, suggesting the presence of """"hotspots"""" where management activities could benefit many species, across all climate scenarios.

I.; Lipsig-Mummé, C.","The interactive effects of climate change and invasive alien species (IAS) pose serious threats to biodiversity, ecosystems and human well-being worldwide. In particular, IAS are predicted to experience widespread changes in distribution in response to climate change, with many expanding their ranges into new areas. However, the two drivers of global change are seldom considered together in policy and management. We conducted a knowledge synthesis to assess the state of research on IAS range shifts under climate change in Canada. We found that the study of IAS distribution changes caused by climate change is a relatively new field of inquiry that integrates research in the areas of ecology, conservation biology, and environmental sciences. The multidisciplinary dimensions of the issue are largely overlooked in the scholarly literature, with most studies having a purely natural science perspective. Very little original research has occurred in the field to date; instead literature reviews are common. Research focuses on modeling range changes of current IAS threats, rather than predicting potential future IAS threats. The most commonly studied IAS already occur in Canada as native species that have spread beyond their range (e. g., lyme disease, mountain pine beetle, smallmouth bass) or as established invaders (e. g., gypsy moth). All of these IAS are expected to expand northward with climate change, resulting in widespread negative impacts on forest and freshwater biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and public health. Many barriers to predicting IAS range change under climate change are identified in the literature, including the complexity of the issue, lack of ecological data, and failure to integrate climate change - IAS interactions into research, policy, and management.

J.; Kumar, A.","The Arctic is warming at four times the global rate, changing the diversity, activity and distribution of vectors and associated pathogens. While the Arctic is not often considered a hotbed of vector-borne diseases, Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) and Snowshoe Hare virus (SSHV) are mosquito-borne zoonotic viruses of the California serogroup endemic to the Canadian North. The viruses are maintained by transovarial transmission in vectors and circulate among vertebrate hosts, both of which are not well characterized in Arctic regions. While most human infections are subclinical or mild, serious cases occur, and both JCV and SSHV have recently been identified as leading causes of arbovirus-associated neurological diseases in North America. Consequently, both viruses are currently recognised as neglected and emerging viruses of public health concern. This review aims to summarise previous findings in the region regarding the enzootic transmission cycle of both viruses. We identify key gaps and approaches needed to critically evaluate, detect, and model the effects of climate change on these uniquely northern viruses. Based on limited data, we predict that (1) these northern adapted viruses will increase their range northwards, but not lose range at their southern limits, (2) undergo more rapid amplification and amplified transmission in endemic regions for longer vector-biting seasons, (3) take advantage of northward shifts of hosts and vectors, and (4) increase bite rates following an increase in the availability of breeding sites, along with phenological synchrony between the reproduction cycle of theorized reservoirs (such as caribou calving) and mosquito emergence.",2023,"JUN","VIRUSES-BASEL","15","6","","WOS:001017866600001","10.3390/v15061242","","#11455","Snyman 2023","","Biotic",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Due in part to the species' lack of popularity as a game and commercial fish, few regions consider burbot in management plans. We review the worldwide population status of burbot and synthesize reasons why some burbot populations are endangered or declining, some burbot populations have recovered and some burbot populations do not recover despite management measures. Burbot have been extirpated in much of Western Europe and the United Kingdom and are threatened or endangered in much of North America and Eurasia. Pollution and habitat change, particularly the effects of dams, appear to be the main causes for declines in riverine burbot populations. Pollution and the adverse effects of invasive species appear to be the main reasons for declines in lacustrine populations. Warmer water temperatures, due either to discharge from dams or climate change, have been noted in declining burbot populations at the southern extent of their range.

Those species that can successfully track their niche may minimize extinction risks. However, establishment of new species into recipient communities will lead to species rearrangement and novel biotic interactions. Currently, we have a limited understanding of how these processes affect communities and ecosystems. In this review we synthesize current knowledge on range-expanding species. We start with addressing the many terms used for describing different aspects of range expansions, such as native-invasive, encroachers, and intra-continental invasive species. Thereafter, we describe the factors driving range expansions, and the effects on recipient communities and at the ecosystem level. Our research indicates that, similar to the study of biological invasions, current knowledge on range expansions is highly biased, with most of the studies focusing on Europe and North America. A large part of the available research targets trees and shrubs and the most investigated habitats are grasslands, savannas and high-elevation habitats. One potential consequence of such research bias is that range expansion of many herbaceous species (especially of those species not important for agriculture) may go undetected. Another important finding is that the same factor may promote or hinder range expansion depending on habitat, life form, spatial and temporal scale at which the process is studied. Finally, while many range expansions have negative consequences on local biodiversity and community stability, some of them have positive effects (e.g. mangroves). Although an increasing number of studies investigated the effects of range expansion on recipient communities, our research indicates that we still have a limited knowledge of such processes. Future efforts should integrate both empirical and modeling approaches to disentangle the joint effects of biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors on range expansion.

While Kalm's 'Travels into North America' is well known, his 1754 report remains obscure. Some authors were skeptical that Kalm referred to A. americanum because he encountered them at sites farther north outside of the species' range. However, the details in 1754 report leave no doubt that Kalm described lone star ticks. In this historical review, we provide support for Kalm's identification using a modern translation of his 1754 report and other sources. We also delineate distributional changes of lone star ticks from the pre-colonization era to the present and interpret them in the context of large-scale anthropogenic changes in the landscape. In this framework, the lone star tick's current northward expansion is a recolonization of their former range. Extensive deforestation and extirpation of their principal host species, white-tailed deer, led to A. americanum's disappearance from the northern parts of its range by the 20th century. Subsequent recolonization by second-growth forest and increases in white-tailed deer populations by the mid-20th century is now allowing A. americanum to reclaim its former range.These changes in the land appear to be the driving force behind A. americanum's present expansion. Understanding this species' history and the factors contributing to its current expansion will enable better predictions about its future distribution and potential to transmit human pathogens.

R.; Moeykens, S.","Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing development and continuation of sustainable aquaculture in temperate regions. We primarily consider the ecological and physical resilience of aquaculture in the Gulf of Maine (GoM), where a thriving industry includes marine algae, extensive and intensive shellfish aquaculture, and a well-established Atlantic salmon industry, as well as the infrastructure required to support these economically important ventures. The historical record of sea surface temperature in the GoM, estimated from gridded, interpolated in situ measurements, shows considerable interannual and decade-scale variability superimposed on an overall warming trend. Climate model projections of sea surface temperature indicate that the surface waters in the GoM could warm 0.5-3.5 degrees C beyond recent values by the year 2100. This suggests that, while variability will continue, anomalous warmth of marine heatwaves that have been observed in the past decade could become the norm in the GoM ca. 2050, but with the most significant impacts to existing aquaculture along the southernmost region of the coast. We consider adaptations leading to aquacultural resilience despite the effects of warming, larger numbers of harmful nonindigenous species (including pathogens and parasites), acidification, sea-level rise, and more frequent storms and storm surges. Some new species will be needed, but immediate attention to adapt existing species (e.g. preserve/define wild biodiversity, breed for temperature tolerance and incorporate greater husbandry) and aquaculture infrastructure can be successful. We predict that these measures and continued collaboration between industry, stakeholders, government and researchers will lead to sustaining a vibrant working waterfront in the GoM.",2021,"","Reviews in Aquaculture","13","1","460-765","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/raq.12483","","#16872","Bricknell 2021","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-11-22 05:39:46)(Select): Gulf of Maine is a transboundary body of water so reasonable transboundary assumption ;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

L.","This review article describes the general ecology of the rivers and streams occupied by anadromous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), including many of the physical and biological variables that are important characteristics of all lotic systems. For analytical purposes, the geographic range of Atlantic salmon rivers is divided into 5 regions (Western Europe, Scandanavia and Russia, Canadian Sheild, Northern Islands, and New England, Nova Scotia and Gaspe Peninsular), based on geomorphology and climate. The geology varies from granitic bedrock to volcanic and glacial substrates, which influence a broad array of other ecological variables, ranging from water chemistry to catchment morphology (e.g. river length). Flood regimes and system hydrology were dependent, as expected, on climate. Other factors considered include length of growing season, the role of ice, productivity, riparian vegetation, land uses/major impacts and aquatic temperature regime. Most rivers were characterized as oligotrophic with relatively low annual primary productivity. However, physical factors such as availability of suitable spawning and rearing habitat, as well as aquatic temperature and flow regimes, may drive anadromous productivity. In general, most of the rivers have been modified by flow regulation and many suffer from impacts related to other anthropogenic disturbances, principally riparian forest clearing for agriculture, forestry and urban development. It is concluded that the rivers and streams occupied by anadromous Atlantic salmon are diverse across the species' range and have been heavily impacted by anthropogenic disturbances.",1998,"","Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences","55","Supplement1","267-280","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-55-S1-267","","#18036","Elliott 1998","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-12 06:16:13)(Select): I could not find specific transboundary flows mentioned (i.e., across border between US and Canada).

T.","West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus with a global distribution that is maintained in an enzootic cycle between Culex species mosquitoes and avian hosts. Human infection, which occurs as a result of spillover from this cycle, is generally subclinical or results in a self-limiting febrile illness. Central nervous system infection occurs in a minority of infections and can lead to long-term neurological complications and, rarely, death. WNV is the most prevalent arthropod-borne virus in the United States. Climate change can influence several aspects of WNV transmission including the vector, amplifying host, and virus. Climate change is broadly predicted to increase WNV distribution and risk across the globe, yet there will likely be significant regional variability and limitations to this effect. Increases in temperature can accelerate mosquito and pathogen development, drive increases in vector competence for WNV, and also alter mosquito life history traits including longevity, blood feeding behavior and fecundity. Precipitation, humidity and drought also impact WNV transmissibility. Alteration in avian distribution, diversity and phenology resulting from climate variation add additional complexity to these relationships. Here, we review WNV epidemiology, transmission, disease and genetics in the context of laboratory studies, field investigations, and infectious disease models under climate change. We summarize how mosquito genetics, microbial interactions, host dynamics, viral strain, population size, land use and climate account for distinct relationships that drive WNV activity and discuss how these dynamic and evolving interactions could shape WNV transmission and disease under climate change.",2022,"","Special Issue: Viruses and climate change.","114","","147-193","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.aivir.2022.08.002","","#18181","Fay 2022","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-16 08:24:20)(Select): There is a reference to the vector spreading potentially across the US/Canada border: """"Cx. pipiens are predicted to become more widely present in Canada (Chen et al., 2013; Hongoh et al., 2012), with northward shifts across the northern hemisphere"""", but I could not find any links to biodiversity.; ","Biotic",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

During 2000-2020, trends in bark beetle impacts changed dramatically across North America compared to those observed during the mid- to late 20th century. We review tools and tactics available for bark beetle suppression and prevention and provide an overview of temporal and spatial trends in bark beetle impacts in North American forests during 2000-2020.

The published literature on spatial dynamics (such as dispersal and metapopulation dynamics), habitat fragmentation and climate change requires synthesis and a conceptual framework to simplify thinking. We propose a framework that integrates how climate change affects spatial population dynamics and the effects of habitat fragmentation in terms of: (i) habitat quality, quantity and distribution; (ii) habitat connectivity; and (iii) the dynamics of habitat itself. We use the framework to categorize existing autecological studies and investigate how each is affected by anthropogenic climate change. It is clear that a changing climate produces changes in the geographic distribution of climatic conditions, and the amount and quality of habitat. The most thorough published studies show how such changes impact metapopulation persistence, source-sink dynamics, changes in species' geographic range and community composition. Climate-related changes in movement behavior and quantity, quality and distribution of habitat have also produced empirical changes in habitat connectivity for some species. An underexplored area is how habitat dynamics that are driven by climatic processes will affect species that live in dynamic habitats. We end our discussion by suggesting ways to improve current attempts to integrate climate change, spatial population dynamics and habitat fragmentation effects, and suggest distinct areas of study that might provide opportunities for more fully integrative work.",2016,"","Integrative Zoology","11","1","40-59","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1749-4877.12167","","#19228","Holyoak 2016","Alice Gaalswyk (2024-11-28 04:06:40)(Select): doesn't have a huge specific focus on North America but transboundary flows in North America are mentioned and I think it's relevant enough to the study to be included ;","Biotic; Transboundary unclear",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

C.; Coulibaly, P.","Groundwater in the Great Lakes Basin (GLB) serves as a reservoir of approximately 4000 to 5500 km3 of water and is a significant source of water to the Great Lakes. Indirect groundwater inflow from tributaries of the Great Lakes may account for 5-25% of the total water inflow to the Great Lakes and in Lake Michigan it is estimated that groundwater directly contributes 2-2.5% of the total water inflow. Despite these estimates, there is great uncertainty with respect to the impact of groundwater on surface water in the GLB. In terms of water quantity, groundwater discharge is spatially and temporally variable from the reach to the basin scale. Reach scale preferential flow pathways in the sub-surface play an important role in delivering groundwater to surface water bodies, however their identification is difficult a priori with existing data and their impact at watershed to basin scale is unknown. This variability also results in difficulty determining the location and contribution of groundwater to both point and non-point source surface water contamination. With increasing human population in the GLB and the hydrological changes brought on by continued human development and climate change, sound management of water resources will require a better understanding of groundwater surface-water interactions as heterogeneous phenomena both spatially and temporally.

S.","The importance of efficaciously assessing the risk for introduction and establishment of pest species is an increasingly important ecological and economic issue. Evaluation of climate is fundamental to determining the potential success of an introduced or invasive insect pest. However, evaluating climatic suitability poses substantial difficulties; climate can be measured and assessed in a bewildering array of ways. Some physiological filter, in essence a lens that focuses climate through the requirements and constraints of a potential pest introduction, is required. Difficulties in assessing climate suitability are further exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) is an exotic, tree-defoliating insect that is frequently introduced into the western United States. In spite of an abundance of potential host species, these introductions have yet to result in established populations. The success of eradication efforts and the unsuccessful establishment of many detected and undetected introductions may be related to an inhospitable climate. Climatic suitability for gypsy moth in the western United States, however, is potentially improving, perhaps rapidly, due to a general warming trend that began in the mid 1970s and continues today. In this work, we describe the application of a physiologically based climate suitability model for evaluating risk of gypsy moth establishment on a landscape level. Development of this risk assessment system first required amassing databases that integrated the gypsy moth climatic assessment model, with host species distributions, and climate (historical, present, and future). This integrated system was then used to evaluate climate change scenarios for native host species in Utah, with the result that risk of establishment will dramatically increase during the remainder of the 21st century under reasonable climate change scenarios. We then applied the risk assessment system to several case histories of detected gypsy moth introductions in Utah. These applications demonstrated the general utility of the system for predicting risk of establishment and for designing improved risk detection strategies.",2007,"","Ecological Applications","17","1","101-117","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2007)017[0101:RAITFO]2.0.CO;2","","#20547","Logan 2007","","Biotic",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis, walleye Sander vitreus and smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu were examined to assess the potential effects of climate change on guilds of Great Lakes cold, cool and warm-water fishes, respectively. Overall, the projection for these fishes are for the increased thermally suitable habitat within the lakes, though in different regions than they currently inhabit. Colder-water fishes wil seek refuge further north and deeper in the water column and warmer-water fishes will fill the vacated habiat space in the warmer regions of the lakes. While these projection can be modified by a number of other habitat elements (e.g. anoxia, ice cover, dispersal ability and trophic productivity), it is clear that climate-change drivers will challenge the nature, flexibility and public perception of current fisheries management programmes.

"66","Recent climate change in the Arctic and its impact on contaminant pathways and interpretation of temporal trend data","Macdonald, R. W.; Harner, T.; Fyfe, J.","The Arctic has undergone dramatic change during the past decade. The observed changes include atmospheric sea-level pressure, wind fields, sea-ice drift, ice cover, length of melt season, change in precipitation patterns, change in hydrology and change in ocean currents and watermass distribution. It is likely that these primary changes have altered the carbon cycle and biological systems, but the difficulty of observing these together with sporadic, incomplete time series makes it difficult to evaluate what the changes have been. Because contaminants enter global systems and transport through air and water, the changes listed above will clearly alter contaminant pathways. Here, we review what is known about recent changes using the Arctic Oscillation as a proxy to help us understand the forms under which global change will be manifest in the Arctic. For Pb, Cd and Zn, the Arctic is likely to become a more effective trap because precipitation is likely to increase. In the case of Cd, the natural cycle in the ocean appears to have a much greater potential to alter exposure than do human releases of this metal. Mercury has an especially complex cycle in the Arctic including a unique scavenging process (mercury depletion events), biomagnifying foodwebs, and chemical transformations such as methylation. The observation that mercury seems to be increasing in a number of aquatic species whereas atmospheric gaseous mercury shows little sign of change suggests that factors related to change in the physical system (ice cover, permafrost degradation, organic carbon cycling) may be more important than human activities. Organochlorine contaminants offer a surprising array of possibilities for changed pathways. To change in precipitation patterns can be added change in ice cover (air-water exchange), change in food webs either from the top down or from the bottom up (biomagnification), change in the organic carbon cycle and change in diets. Perhaps the most interesting possibility, presently difficult to predict, is combination of immune suppression together with expanding ranges of disease vectors. Finally, biotransport through migratory species is exceptionally vulnerable to changes in migration strength or in migration pathway - in the Arctic, change in the distribution of ice and temperature may already have caused such changes. Hydrocarbons, which tend to impact surfaces, will be mostly affected by change in the ice climate (distribution and drift tracks). Perhaps the most dramatic changes will occur because our view of the Arctic Ocean will change as it becomes more amenable to transport, tourism and mineral exploration on the shelves. Radionuclides have tended not to produce a radiological problem in the Arctic; nevertheless one pathway, the ice, remains a risk because it can accrue, concentrate and transport radio-contaminated sediments. This pathway is sensitive to where ice is produced, what the transport pathways of ice are, and where ice is finally melted - all strong candidates for change during the coming century. The changes that have already occurred in the Arctic and those that are projected to occur have an effect on contaminant time series including direct measurements (air, water, biota) or proxies (sediment cores, ice cores, archive material). Although these 'system' changes can alter the flux and concentrations at given sites in a number of obvious ways, they have been all but ignored in the interpretation of such time series. To understand properly what trends mean, especially in complex 'recorders' such as seals, walrus and polar bears, demands a more thorough approach to time series by collecting data in a number of media coherently. Presently, a major reservoir for contaminants and the one most directly connected to biological uptake in species at greatest risk-the ocean-practically lacks such time series.",2005,"","Special Issue: Sources, occurrence, trends and pathways of contaminants in the arctic physical environment.","342","1/3","5-86","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2004.12.059","","#20685","Macdonald 2005","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-02 11:39:20)(Select): There is a whole section on climate change and the impacts on species through migration, and invasions.

The millions of prairie-pothole wetlands scattered across the Prairie Pothole Region (hereafter PPR) provide critical ecosystem functions at local, regional, and continental scales. However, an estimated loss of 50% of historical wetlands and the widespread conversion of grasslands to cropland make the PPR a heavily modified landscape. Therefore, it is essential to understand the current and potential future stressors affecting prairie-pothole wetland ecosystems in order to conserve and restore their functions. Here, we describe a conceptual model that illustrates how (a) historical wetland losses, (b) anthropogenic landscape modifications, and (c) climate change interact and have altered the variability among remaining depressional wetland ecosystems (i.e., ecosystem homogenization) in the PPR.

Like most hotspots, the Southeast is also threatened by human activities, with the total reduction of southeastern grasslands estimated as 90 percent (upwards to 100 percent for some types) and with many threats escalating today. This report summarizes the results of a multistakeholder workshop organized by the Southeastern Grasslands Initiative and the U.S. Geological Survey, held in January 2020 to provide a scientific needs assessment to help inform the Species Status Assessment (SSA) process under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, with a focus on grassland species and communities of conservation concern in the southeastern United States. This report reviews the ecology of southeastern grasslands, including influences on their origin, maintenance, and high species richness and endemism; presents findings from the workshop; and discusses science questions, hypotheses, and possibilities for future research projects to help fill key knowledge gaps. Participants in the January 2020 workshop, representing diverse expertise in various topics in southeastern grassland ecology, were tasked with identifying major threats to grassland species in the Southeast as well as potential ways to make the SSA process more efficient and effective. An underlying assumption and starting place for workshop discussion was that an ecosystem-based approach to the SSA process is more cost-efficient than a species-by-species approach, in large part because many species with similar biological requirements can be addressed by the same actions. Nevertheless, one partner in this effort, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, does require specific attention be given to taxa that have been petitioned for Federal listing, though as often as possible these taxa are considered alongside a larger group of priority taxa with an ecosystem approach. For group discussions, workshop participants followed a modified """"World Cafe"""" method, a structured conversational approach for knowledge sharing. Group discussions focused on five categories of threats to grassland communities and species: (1) habitat loss, fragmentation, and disruption of functional population connectivity; (2) climate change, especially changes in temperature and precipitation, including intensity and seasonality, and impacts on soil moisture, groundwater levels, and other ecosystem parameters; (3) changes to disturbance regimes, as influenced by climate and land-use change, extinctions, and human attitudes and behaviors; (4) invasive species (not limited to nonnative species); and (5) localized or subregional impacts such as sea-level rise. In addition to group discussions, workshop participants-as well as other grassland experts who were unable to attend the workshop-completed a preworkshop survey concerning challenges and opportunities for grassland conservation.

K.","The Great Miami (GM) and Little Miami (LM) watersheds in Ohio are included in the 51 major river systems in the United States for long-term assessment of conditions of water quality under the USGS National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loadings have decreased over the years in the GM and LM basins, however, they still remain among the highest concentrations detected in the nation. The latest nutrient loading analysis from Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) showed slightly above period of record averages for N and P. Significant amounts of mobilized agricultural N and P from fertilizers in watersheds are transported to the Ohio River and other coastal marine systems such as the Gulf of Mexico, leading to increased growth of harmful algal blooms. In the GM and LM watersheds, changes in flood frequency and intensity are projected to occur in the future as heavy precipitation events are likely to increase as a result of climate change. As climate plays a role for nutrient transformation and transport, studies have shown that N and P inputs to surface waters from agriculture and other sources are projected to continue to increase over the next several decades. This paper reviewed the means of how the GM and LM watersheds are ecologically affected by the N and P nutrient pollution and how climate change impacts the quantity of N and P loadings that go into the river systems. Without better understanding of the nutrient loading processes and their association with various agricultural practices and interactions with climate, there could be additional threats to water quality in both the GM and LM watersheds in decades to come.

"70","Mountain pine beetle: an example of a climate-driven eruptive insect impacting conifer forest ecosystems","Sambaraju, K. R.; Goodsman, D. W.","Climate change is altering the survival and reproductive capacity of plant-feeding insects in multiple ecosystems worldwide, in some cases creating conditions highly suitable for population eruptions. Forest ecosystems are particularly sensitive to climate change as their vulnerability is manifested, in part, as an upsurge in natural disturbances such as native insect outbreaks. The mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a phloem-feeding bark beetle indigenous to western North America that attacks most species of pine including its major hosts, lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine. Adult mass aggregation, mediated by pheromones, helps the beetle to overcome tree defenses eventually killing the tree. Recent outbreaks of this insect have caused extensive pine mortality and have affected millions of hectares of forested area in western North America. Climate is a major driver of these outbreaks. In this review, we describe the direct influences of various climate-related factors on MPB development, outbreak behavior, and range expansion and their indirect impact on MPB epidemiology via influences on host trees and MPB-associated fungi. We also underscore the ecological and economic consequences of the recent, unprecedented MPB outbreak. Of serious concern currently is whether climate change will facilitate rapid establishment and spread of MPB in naive pine forests. MPB will likely adapt quickly to new thermal environments under climate change given its short generation time; however, uncertainties and gaps in our understanding of MPB population dynamics (e.g., trophic interactions) in newly invaded habitats preclude an accurate assessment of outbreak potential and spread at this time.",2021,"","CAB Reviews","16","018","1-18","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/PAVSNNR202116018","","#22886","Sambaraju 2021","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-06 09:34:37)(Select): Range expansion of the southern pine beetle referenced multiple times as well as current range in US and Canada - so I think cross border expansion is likely implicit ; Anabel Kinsey (2024-10-17 14:05:27)(Select): """"overflew the geoclimatic barrier of the Rocky Mountains and spread further northeastward into the province of Alberta, Canada, than has been previously recorded"""" definitely a flow that could be implicitly transboundary. ; ","Biotic",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

We discuss current challenges and emerging issues for these species, and focus on invasive species management, understanding basic biology, conserving multiple species, and adapting to climate change. We highlight several success stories from around the region. We conclude that butterfly biologists and land managers in the WPG are in a unique position to conserve the region's threatened prairie butterflies.

R.; Meigs, G. W.; Calkins, S. J.; Reilly, M. J.; Merschel, A. G.; Cline, S. P.; Comeleo, R. L.","Forest biological disturbance agents (BDAs) are insects, pathogens, and parasitic plants that affect tree decline, mortality, and forest ecosystems processes. BDAs are commonly thought to increase the likelihood and severity of fire by converting live standing trees to more flammable, dead and downed fuel. However, recent research indicates that BDAs do not necessarily increase, and can reduce, the likelihood or severity of fire. This has led to confusion regarding the role of BDAs in influencing fuels and fire in fire-prone western United States forests. Here, we review the existing literature on BDAs and their effects on fuels and fire in the western US and develop a conceptual framework to better understand the complex relationships between BDAs, fuels and fire. We ask: (1) What are the major BDA groups in western US forests that affect fuels? and (2) How do BDA-affected fuels influence fire risk and outcomes? The conceptual framework is rooted in the spatiotemporal aspects of BDA life histories, which drive forest impacts, fuel characteristics and if ignited, fire outcomes. Life histories vary among BDAs from episodic, landscape-scale outbreaks (bark beetles, defoliators), to chronic, localized disturbance effects (dwarf mistletoes, root rots). Generally, BDAs convert aboveground live biomass to dead biomass, decreasing canopy fuels and increasing surface fuels. However, the rate of conversion varies with time-since-event and among BDAs and forest types, resulting in a wide range of effects on the amount of dead fuels at any given time and place, which interacts with the structure and composition of the stand before and subsequent to BDA events. A major influence on fuels may be that BDAs have emerged as dominant agents of forest heterogeneity creation. Because BDAs play complex roles in fuels and fire heterogeneity across the western US which are further complicated by interactions with climate change, drought, and forest management (fire suppression), their impacts on fuels, fire and ecological consequences cannot be categorized simply as positive or negative but need to be evaluated within the context of BDA life histories and ecosystem dynamics.",2022,"","Special Issue: Tamm reviews: a high-profile series of invited reviews on key issues in forest ecology and management around the world.","525","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120572","","#23188","Shaw 2022","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-15 14:42:56)(Select): I could not find any specific transboundary flows affected by climate change.

With this mapping exercise, we collate and describe the quantity and key characteristics of the available evidence base, including the taxa, species conservation status, locations, and contexts relating to the use of this conservation tactic. Findings from this exercise highlight that assisted migration has been implemented very few times as a conservation tactic, though assisted migration has been conducted experimentally (for research purposes) and inadvertently (e.g., for reforestation) much more frequently. Assisted migration was most common for plants (particularly trees), followed by birds, and was rarely implemented for other taxa.

Plant pathogens that infect foliage are a diverse assemblage of fungi representing both phyla: Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Although most of the species found on living leaves have been well studied by mycologists and plant pathologists, recent studies have remarkably enhanced the current understanding of species numbers and their evolutionary relationships. The impact of global climate change, the increasing international exchange of plant material and the lack of proper phytosanitary practices have resulted in the potential re-emergences of formerly known destructive fungi, infecting new hosts in new geographic locations. Routinely inspecting diseased plants and accurately identifying and naming causative agents are vital for mitigating the impact of invasive and other non-indigenous pathogens on crops and native flora. It is also necessary to characterise foliar pathogenic fungi based on molecular phylogeny, morphology, pathogenicity and the comparative analysis of fungal genomic data.

R.; Starks, P. J.; Will, R. E.; Zhong, Yu; Acharya, B. S.","In the Great Plains of the central United States, water resources for human and aquatic life rely primarily on surface runoff and local recharge from rangelands that are under rapid transformation to woodland by the encroachment of Eastern redcedar (redcedar; Juniperus virginiana) trees. In this synthesis, the current understanding and impact of redcedar encroachment on the water budget and water resources available for non-ecosystem use are reviewed. Existing studies concluded that the conversion from herbaceous-dominated rangeland to redcedar woodland increases precipitation loss to canopy interception and vegetation transpiration. The decrease of soil moisture, particularly for the subsurface soil layer, is widely documented. The depletion of soil moisture is directly related to the observed decrease in surface runoff, and the potential of deep recharge for redcedar encroached watersheds. Model simulations suggest that complete conversion of the rangelands to redcedar woodland at the watershed and basin scale in the South-central Great Plains would lead to reduced streamflow throughout the year, with the reductions of streamflow between 20 to 40% depending on the aridity of the climate of the watershed. Recommended topics for future studies include: (i) The spatial dynamics of redcedar proliferation and its impact on water budget across a regional hydrologic network; (ii) the temporal dynamics of precipitation interception by the herbaceous canopy; (iii) the impact of redcedar infilling into deciduous forests such as the Cross Timbers and its impact on water budget and water availability for non-ecosystem use; (iv) land surface and climate interaction and cross-scale hydrological modeling and forecasting; (v) impact of redcedar encroachment on sediment production and water quality; and (vi) assessment and efficacy of different redcedar control measures in restoring hydrological functions of watershed.",2018,"","Water","10","12","1768","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10121768","","#24971","Zou 2018","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-15 11:38:00)(Select): The flow is water, water reduction due to the spread of redcedar - range is in US and extends up into Canada.

"77","A review of the interaction between forest birds and eastern spruce budworm","Venier, LA; Holmes, S B","The eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana Clem., (hereafter budworm) is responsible for the largest areas of insect-caused disturbance in North America, and as such, is an important part of spruce-fir forest change and succession. The insectivorous forest bird community shows large and rapid responses to budworm outbreaks. There is good evidence that there are budworm-linked species (bay-breasted, Cape May, and Tennessee warblers) that respond to budworm outbreak much more strongly and consistently than other species, probably through increased productivity of local populations when budworm are abundant. There also appears to be a more widespread positive bird community response to budworm outbreak that involves many more species. The response is evident in local and regional scale studies, but individual species' responses across studies are not always consistent, probably because of the relatively small number of studies conducted in a wide variety of contexts. Budworm outbreaks provide a short-term increase in food supply for birds, but also result in longer-term habitat change due to budworm-induced defoliation and tree mortality. Birds appear to influence budworm cycles, mostly at endemic population levels, through predation of large larvae and pupae. There are good arguments suggesting that bird predation is not the primary cause of budworm oscillations, but may play a role in determining the mean level of oscillations. Climate change is expected to change the bird-budworm relationship through changes in fire regimes, spruce-fir distributions, bird distributions, and budworm and bird phenology.Original Abstract: La tordeuse du bourgeon de l'epinette, Choristoneura fumiferana Clem., (ci-apres nommee tordeuse) est responsable des plus grandes superficies devastees par des insectes en Amerique du Nord, et comme telle joue un role important dans les changements et la succession des forets de sapin et d'epinette. La communaute des oiseaux forestiers insectivores reagit fortement et rapidement aux invasions par la tordeuse. Il semble evident qu'il existe des relations entre les especes liees a la tordeuse (parulines a flanc marron, du Cap May et du Tennessee) qui reagissent aux epidemies de tordeuses plus fortement et plus regulierement que les autres especes, probablement par une productivite accrue des populations locales lorsque les tordeuses sont abondantes. Il semble egalement y avoir plus de reactions positives et etendues de la communaute aviaire impliquant plusieurs autres especes. La reaction est evidente dans les etudes a l'echelle locale et regionale, mais les reactions des especes individuelles pour l'ensemble des especes ne sont pas toujours congrues, probablement liees au nombre relativement faible d'etudes conduites dans une grande variete de contexte. Les epidemies de tordeuses fournissent une augmentation a court terme de nourriture pour les oiseaux, mais conduisent aussi a des modifications a long terme de l'habitat suite a la defoliation causee par la tordeuse et la mortalite des arbres. Les oiseaux semblent influencer les cycles de la tordeuse, surtout a l'etat endemique des populations, par predation des grosses larves et des pupes. Il y a de bons arguments suggerant que la predation par les oiseaux ne constitue pas la cause primaire des oscillations de la tordeuse, mais pourrait jouer un role determinant dans le degre moyen d'oscillation.

The LRGV represents a unique transition between temperate and tropical conditions and, as such, sustains an exceptionally high diversity of plants and animals-some of them found in few, or no other, places in the United States. Examples include Leopardus pardalis albescens(northern ocelot) and Falco femoralis septentrionalis(northern aplomado falcon)-both endangered in the United States and emblematic of the LRGV. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) manages three national wildlife refuges (Santa Ana, Lower Rio Grande Valley, and Laguna Atascosa) that together make up the South Texas Refuge Complex, which actively conserves biodiversity in about 76,006 hectares (187,815.5 acres) of native riparian and upland habitats in the LRGV. These diminished habitats harbor many rare, threatened, and endangered species. This report updates the widely used 1988 USFWS biological report titled """"Tamaulipan Brushland of the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas: Description, Human Impacts, and Management Options"""" by synthesizing nearly 400 peer-reviewed scientific publications that have resulted from biological and sociological research conducted specifically in the four Texas counties of the LRGV in the past nearly 30 years. This report has three goals: (1) synthesize scientific insights gained since 1988 related to the biology and management of the LRGV and its unique biota, focusing on flora and fauna of greatest conservation concern; (2) update ongoing challenges facing Federal and State agencies and organizations that focus on conservation or key natural resources in the LRGV; and (3) redefine conservation opportunities and land-acquisition strategies that are feasible and appropriate today, given the many new and expanding constraints that challenge conservation activities in the LRGV. The LRGV faces every contemporary conservation challenge of the 21st century, but ongoing human population growth and its associated demands, international border issues, and oil, gas, and alternative energy development dominate impacts that affect conservation in the LRGV. Continued careful syntheses of existing and future information collected in the LRGV are needed on many biological and sociological topics to guide conservation activities. Quick response will no doubt be necessary to face contemporary and difficult-to-predict challenges such as climate change, diminished water availability and quality, spread of invasive species, and habitat loss and fragmentation. Complexities of a guarded international borderland add pressure to small patches of native habitat that remain in many places of the LRGV, particularly along the Rio Grande. Large connected corridors of restored native habitat could be the best option to maintain, and even enhance, the exceptional biodiversity of the LRGV in the face of exceptional human demand.",2016,"01-01","Scientific Investigations Report.
