"1","Consequences of Shifts in Abundance and Distribution of American Chestnut for Restoration of a Foundation Forest Tree","Dalgleish, H. J.; Nelson, C. D.; Scrivani, J. A.; Jacobs, D. F.","Restoration of foundation species, such as the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) that was devastated by an introduced fungus, can restore ecosystem function. Understanding both the current distribution as well as biogeographic patterns is important for restoration planning. We used United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data to quantify the current density and distribution of C. dentata. We then review the literature concerning biogeographic patterns in C. dentata. Currently, 431 +/- 30.2 million stems remain. The vast majority (360 +/- 22 million) are sprouts <2.5 cm dbh. Although this number is approximately 10% of the estimated pre-blight population, blight has caused a major shift in the size structure. The current-day population has a larger range, particularly west and north, likely due to human translocation. While climate change could facilitate northward expansion, limited seed reproduction makes this unlikely without assisted migration. Previous research demonstrates that the current, smaller population contains slightly higher genetic diversity than expected, although little information exists on biogeographic patterns in the genetics of adaptive traits. Our research provides a baseline characterization of the contemporary population of C. dentata, to enable monitoring stem densities and range limits to support restoration efforts.",2016,"JAN","Forests","7","1","","WOS:000369493400009","10.3390/f7010004","","#2684","Dalgleish 2016","Anabel Kinsey (2024-11-24 05:05:33)(Select): Figure 1 shows expansion into Ontario, definitely transboundary ; ","Biotic; Intervention; Transboundary unclear",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"2","Some Holocene palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental perspectives on Arctic/Subarctic climate warming and the IPCC 4th Assessment Report","Macdonald, G. M.","The IPCC 4th Assessment Report(FAR)is considered in light of Holocene palaeo-records of Arctic and Subarctic land temperatures and the response of the boreal forest-tundra boundary to past and present warming. The palaeo-records appear to support and amplify some of the conclusions in FAR and raise questions about others. Comparison of the FAR estimates for late 21st-century warming with Arctic and Subarctic palaeoclimatic records suggests that anticipated future warming will be unprecedented compared to earlier Holocene warming including the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) and subsequent Medieval Warm Period (MWP). Annual warming and winter warming will likely be greater than during earlier periods in the Holocene, but summer temperatures projected by FAR may approximate or not far exceed the summer warming of the HTM. The geographically synchronous pattern of 21st-century warming projected by FAR will differ from the observed geographic variability in the timing of the HTM, particularly in the western Arctic. Further palaeo-record syntheses are required to fully delineate the similarities and differences between the HTM and the projected conditions of the 21 st century. In addition, palaeo-records suggest that the Arctic and Subarctic climate may be sensitive to relatively small changes in solar irradiance and understanding the potential effects of natural variations in irradiance on the future climate of the Arctic and Subarctic remains a question deserving further research. FAR mapped estimates of a significant northward displacement of boreal forest and woodland clue to warming imply that boreal forest or woodland will displace tundra as far north as the Arctic coastline by AD 2100. In Eurasia the estimated AD 2100 location of the tree line appears to approximate the HTM location. In North America an advance of forest to the coastline on the north slope of Alaska, central Canada and northern Quebec would far outdistance the relatively limited northward advances of boreal forest during the HTM. However, rates of tree species advance and subsequent forest development based on palaeo-records and Currently observed tree line advances raise questions about the likelihood that northward migration and subsequent increases in the population sizes of boreal tree species could occur rapidly enough to establish continuous forest and woodland as far north as the Arctic coastlines of Eurasia and North America by AD 2100. Determining potential rates of northward advance of the northern forests requires further ecological and palaeoecological investigations.

"3","The Feasibility and Governance of Cyclone Interventions","Miller, J.; Tang, A. R.; Tran, T. L.; Prinsley, R.; Howden, M.","Climate change is worsening cyclone disaster risk. Current risk reduction responses focus on reducing vulnerability and exposure. However, these approaches are not keeping up with climate change. Intervening in the cyclone hazard itself has the potential to prevent deaths and destruction, and reduce the costs of disaster recovery. We provide a technical review of these interventions. This unifies an otherwise sparse and disconnected literature, providing a starting point for further discussion by academics and policymakers. Potential interventions include cloud seeding, using pipes to inject cool water into cyclone hotspots, injecting particles into the upper atmosphere and atmospheric aerosol injections. Approaches have different logistical requirements, side effects and promise. Understanding the effectiveness and associated risks of different interventions will inform prudent cyclone risk management and research. Our review points to the promise of aerosol injection and high-altitude particle injection as first research directions. We also discuss potential governance risks and requirements of cyclone interventions. Cyclone interventions raise many issues, ranging from robust monitoring of ecological side effects, to geopolitics and politicisation. Current international climate governance is ill-suited for potential technologies on the horizon. Good decision-making is required to maximise benefits and reduce negative impacts. Cyclone interventions could be a potentially transformative response to climate change, and should be a priority for future research.",2023,"","Climate Risk Management","41","","","WOS:001059450000001","10.1016/j.crm.2023.100535","","#8245","Miller 2023","Elliott Parsons (2024-10-30 14:46:39)(Select): Yes a review, yes climate change impacts on cyclones (wind/water flow).

"4","Can Boreal and Temperate Forest Management be Adapted to the Uncertainties of 21st Century Climate Change?","Park, A.; Puettmann, K.; Wilson, E.; Messier, C.; Kames, S.; Dhar, A.","Considerable uncertainties remain about magnitude and character, if not general direction of anthropogenic climate change. Global mean temperature could increase by 1.5-4.5 degrees C or more over historic levels, and extreme weather eventsdrought, storms, and floodingare likely to increase greatly in frequency. Although ecologists and foresters agree that the practice of forestry will be transformed under climate change, these uncertainties compound the challenge of achieving sustainable, adaptive forest management. In this aritcle, we (i) present a multidisciplinary synthesis of current knowledge of responses of temperate and boreal tree species and forest communities to climate change, and (ii) outline silvicultural strategies for adapting temperate and boreal forests to confront climate change. Our knowledge synthesis proceeds through critical appraisals of efforts to model future tree distributions and responses to climate change, and reviews physiological, phenological, acclimation, and epigenetic responses to climate. As is the case of climate change itself, there are numerous uncertainties about tree species and provenance responses to climate change. For example, acclimation of respiration and epigenetic conditioning of seed embryos has the potential to buffer species against limited warming. Provenances within species also display idiosyncratic responses to altered climates, implying that soemm varieties will be more resilient or resistant to climate change than others. Genetically determined limits to climatic tolerance, and the limits of tree community resistance and resilience (speed of recovery from disturbance) in the face of climate-related disturbances are largely unknown. These unknowns require managers to adopt a portfolio of silvicultural strategies, which may range from minor modifications of current practices to design of novel multi-species stands that may have no historical analogue. Forest managers must be prepared to respond nimbly as they develop, incorporate new insights about climate change and species responses to warming into their practices. Marshalling all strategies and sources of knowledge should enable forest managers to mount (at least) a partially successful response to the challenges of climate change.",2014,"","Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences","33","4","251-285","WOS:000336796000001","10.1080/07352689.2014.858956","","#9338","Park 2014","Elliott Parsons (2024-11-08 13:49:13)(Select): Going to vote to accept - though this article does not explicitly refer to transboundary border movements, it has indirect examples everywhere - for example, assisted migration, and RTFs - and it talks a lot about northward movements.

"5","Worldwide status of burbot and conservation measures","Stapanian, M. A.; Paragamian, V. L.; Madenjian, C. P.; Jackson, J. R.; Lappalainen, J.; Evenson, M. J.; Neufeld, M. D.","Although burbot (Lota lota Gadidae) are widespread and abundant throughout much of their natural range, there are many populations that have been extirpated, endangered or are in serious decline. Due in part to the species' lack of popularity as a game and commercial fish, few regions consider burbot in management plans. We review the worldwide population status of burbot and synthesize reasons why some burbot populations are endangered or declining, some burbot populations have recovered and some burbot populations do not recover despite management measures. Burbot have been extirpated in much of Western Europe and the United Kingdom and are threatened or endangered in much of North America and Eurasia. Pollution and habitat change, particularly the effects of dams, appear to be the main causes for declines in riverine burbot populations. Pollution and the adverse effects of invasive species appear to be the main reasons for declines in lacustrine populations. Warmer water temperatures, due either to discharge from dams or climate change, have been noted in declining burbot populations at the southern extent of their range. Currently, fishing pressure does not appear to be limiting burbot populations world-wide. We suggest mitigation measures for burbot population recovery, particularly those impacted by dams and invasive species.",2010,"MAR","Fish and Fisheries","11","1","34-56","WOS:000274452100003","10.1111/j.1467-2979.2009.00340.x","","#11627","Stapanian 2010","","Biotic; Intervention",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"6","The application of assisted migration as a climate change adaptation tactic: an evidence map and synthesis","Twardek, W. M.; Taylor, J. J.; Rytwinski, T.; Aitken, S. N.; MacDonald, A. L.; Bogaert, R. van; Cooke, S. J.","Assisted migration entails the human assisted movement of individuals to more climatically-suitable areas within or outside of their current species range to help species respond to climate change. To better understand the potential for assisted migration to benefit species threatened by climate change, we conducted an evidence synthesis to map examples where assisted migration has been implemented around the world. With this mapping exercise, we collate and describe the quantity and key characteristics of the available evidence base, including the taxa, species conservation status, locations, and contexts relating to the use of this conservation tactic. Findings from this exercise highlight that assisted migration has been implemented very few times as a conservation tactic, though assisted migration has been conducted experimentally (for research purposes) and inadvertently (e.g., for reforestation) much more frequently. Assisted migration was most common for plants (particularly trees), followed by birds, and was rarely implemented for other taxa. Our review highlights the need for more research on assisted migration, with particular emphasis on understanding the population- and community-level outcomes of these actions. Our discussion focuses on the potential for assisted migration of Canadian species but will be informative to those considering assisted migration in other jurisdictions.",2023,"","Biological Conservation","280","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.109932","","#23997","Twardek 2023","","Biotic; Intervention; Transboundary unclear",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
