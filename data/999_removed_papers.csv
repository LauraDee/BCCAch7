Numerous ice-dependent species, including polar bears, walrus, seals and Adelie penguins are either threatened with extinction or increasingly vulnerable due to reductions in their ice habitat.19 Warming ocean temperatures, decreasing salinity due to sea ice melt and increasing ocean acidification due to excess CO2 absorption are also affecting other species. Krill, the foundation of the Antarctic food chain, are reported to be disappearing from their traditional spawning grounds20 and evidence is emerging of geographical shifts in populations of other Antarctic species, including the Patagonian toothfish, while non-Antarctic species such as southern bluefin tuna are migrating southwards. In the Arctic, too, cold-adapted fish stocks are being squeezed northward while southern species such as haddock, cod and salmon are migrating into Arctic waters.
The disappearance of polar sea ice will also affect the communities of organisms living in and under the ice. On the one hand, the importance of these communities is demonstrated by recent discoveries in the Antarctic that icebergs, which have been increasing in number over the past decade due to the break up of ice shelves caused by atmospheric warming, are veritable ‘hot spots’ for ocean life, supporting thriving colonies of sea birds, phytoplankton, krill and fish.22 Significant reductions in sea ice extent, such as that already evid- enced in the Arctic,23 can therefore be expected to have detrimental effects on polar pelagic ecosystems. On the other hand, the disappearance of sea ice can be expected to lead to shifts and possible increases in both the diversity and abundance of benthic communities.""""","","Complex change","Decrease","Increase","","","Increase","","No direction mentioned","","","No direction mentioned","No direction mentioned","","Complex change","","land use change, meaning more infrastructure, shipping routes, etc. due to increased accessibility from climate change","Pelagic marine, Coastal marine, Midwater marine, Deep sea, generally arctic ecosystems, especially those with sea ice coverage","krill; haddock; cod; salmon; polar bears; Adelie penguins; seabirds; Patagonia toothfish; walrus; seals","No direction mentioned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Increase","","","","","","","","Climate change impacts Arctic ecosystems through species range shifts, changing sea ice extents, etc., and this triggers need for multilateral governance across nations (USA and CAN are arctic coastal nations).

Moreover, the rapidity of climate change-induced shifts in habitats and trophic food webs could affect contaminant toxicity by altering exposure pathways and increasing susceptibility of some populations, especially those already under stress ;; Spikes in atrazine concentrations may occur after heavy rain events with concentrations reported in North American rivers at up to 108 µg/L and in the Chesapeake Bay at up to 30 µg/L (Fortin et al., 2008). A 96-hour exposure to atrazine at 5 µg/L impaired osmotic control in F. heteroclitus larvae, with higher prevalence of dehydrated larvae at isoosmotic (15 ppt) and extreme (35 ppt) salinities and hyperhydrated larvae at low salinities of 3 ppt (Fortin et al., 2008). In the absence of atrazine, salinity had no effect on the prevalence of hyper or hypo hydrated fish. In estuarine copepods (E. affinis), high (25 ppt) and low (5 ppt) salinity levels increase mortality in response to high doses of the atrazine;; Glaucous gulls (Larus argentatus) had a higher parasitic nematode infection level that was correlated with PCB and organochlorine pesticide concentrations (Sagerup et al., 2000). In laboratory and field studies, northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) exhibited immune suppression because of DDT or dieldrin exposure (Gilbertson et al., 2003). Harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) exhibited a significant correlation between concentrations of PCBs, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), toxaphene, DDT and its metabolites and thymic atrophy and splenic depletion (Breivik et al., 2004). Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) fed POP-contaminated fish collected from the Bering Sea for 2.5 years had higher body burdens of POPs than seals fed relatively uncontaminated fish, and displayed impaired immune responses including suppression of natural killer cell and specific T-cell activity;; OPs, especially PCBs, DDT, dioxins, and furans, have also been investigated as cofactors contributing to recent mass mortality incidences attributed to morbilliviruses among several marine mammal populations (Burek et al., 2008, Kajiwara et al., 2002, Kuiken et al., 2006). For example, a mass mortality incident of 10,000 Caspian seals (Phoco caspica) in the spring and summer 2000 was attributed primarily to canine distemper virus, and like other incidences, was preceded by an unusually mild winter. Kajiwara et al. (2002) found that POP levels, especially for DDT/DDE and PCBs, were higher in animals collected during the Caspian seal epizootic incident than in earlier collections of healthy individuals, suggesting that these contaminants made animals more susceptible to disease;; climate change may also alter patterns of POP bioaccumulation and biomagnification by altering bottom-up or top-down mechanisms controlling trophic food webs (Braune et al., 2005, Macdonald et al., 2003, Schiedek et al., 2007). Climate change-induced alterations in bottom-up controlling mechanisms, such as altered nutrient and primary production, may lead to the addition or removal of trophic levels (Macdonald et al., 2003). This in turn could shift predators higher or lower in the aquatic food web, leading to a respective increase or reduction of POPs. Top-down alterations in trophic structures elicited by the changing climate, for example, could involve the loss or diminished populations of higher trophic level species leading to consumption further down the food chain and reduced POP biomagnification potential.;; In addition to a potentially diminished immune response, other toxic effects linked to chronic, low level POP exposures may impair organism acclimation to ecosystem alterations (Jenssen, 2006).

accumulation can have long-term negative effects on the ecosystem
(Aljerf and AlMasri, 2018), including disrupting the reproductive and
endocrine systems of aquatic wildlife while also altering biodiversity in

higher trophic levels, including humans who consume fish and other
aquatic organisms (Windsor et al., 2017). This highlights the signifi

reduce the impacts caused by POPs released from landfills into water
environments. Challenges associated with identifying reliable tracers for
MSW landfill leachate are regularly reported. Sediment sampled from
the Laurentian Great Lakes basin contain POPs from legacy release from
industrial point sources and atmospheric deposition but are also
contaminated with current-use POPs and emerging contaminants. The
Laurentian Great Lakes continue to receive large direct inputs of currentuse POPs, namely PBDEs and perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs),
particularly perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic
acid (PFOA). However, the region was, and continues to be, subjected to
intensive industrial pressures (Helm et al., 2011) that can convolute
identification of point source polluters. Wastewater treatment plants are
repeatedly implicated as point sources of POPs transformation products
via effluent into receiving aquatic systems. Parent compound concen
trations are often considered, but further focus is needed to address the
proportion of contamination represented by the transformation
(degradation) compounds (Buszka et al., 2009). Elevated concentrations
