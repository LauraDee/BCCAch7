The applied climate change scenarios indicated that watersheds with higher groundwater discharge (i.e., more thermal diversity of fish) are less sensitive to climate change than those with lower discharge.

The results indicated that more water will be available (recharge, streamflow, baseflow, groundwater elevation) in the watershed in winter and fall seasons, but less recharge and streamflow during the summer, which is a critical period for crops.
