Populations were detected in Nebraska in 2009 (Costello and Schaupp 2011); in Alberta, Canada, in 2003 (Cudmore et al. 2010); and in the Northwest Territories, Canada, in 2012 (Natural Resources Canada 2013). Scientists have expressed a concern that mountain pine beetle could expand farther eastward across the boreal forest of Canada and into the Eastern United States (Safranyik et al. 2010). However, Bentz et al. (2010) described the probability of such a range expansion as low during this century.

Historically, mountain pine beetle epidemics were not usual, but the magnitude and extent of recent events may have exceeded the range of historic variability in some cases (Bentz et al. 2009), and have occurred at high elevations where they formerly were uncommon (see ‚ÄúImpacts to Sustainability‚Äù).

",No direction mentioned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Decrease,,,,,"The impacts of insects on forests extend beyond the levels of tree mortality caused and associated cascading ecological effects. For example, bark beetle epidemics may increase water yield yet diminish water quality because of pulses of concentrated nutrients and suspended sediment loads (Mikkelson et al. 2013), as well as degrade air quality by the release of volatile organic compounds and biogenic aerosols (Berg et al. 2013). Landscape aesthetics are important drivers of naturebased tourism and may be negatively affected (Morris et al. 2018). In the wildlandurban interface, concerns are often more practical and focused on property values, hazard trees, and fire risk (Cohen and other 2016). Interestingly, a notable western pine beetle outbreak in southern California affected how homes were advertised and sold (Fettig 2019). ",,"Rising temperatures are linked to higher reproductive rates of mountain pine beetle which can accelerate population growth and result in unprecedented levels of mortality. Though MPB is found in Canada and the US, climate change may lead to ameliorated environments in regions of both nations that have not been historically attacked, which could lead to range expansions across boarders.",Yes,"Several tactics are available to reduce the vulnerability of forests to insects, including those that help reduce atmospheric warming (through reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions), which increases drought stress and the probability that trees will succumb to colonization by insects (Kolb et al. 2016). Others facilitate transition of forest stands to tree species better adapted to future climates (Fettig et al. 2013b, Millar et al. 2007, Millar and Stephenson 2015). Historically, management has focused on suppression and prevention. Suppression involves short-term tactics designed to reduce current infestations by manipulating insect populations through the use of fire, pesticides (contact and systemic insecticides, microbials [bacteria, viruses, pathogens and nematodes]), insect growth regulators, soaps, and horticultural oils, semiochemicals (chemicals produced by one organism that elicits a response, usually behavioral, in another organisms, e.g., pheromones), sanitation harvests (harvesting currently infested material and destroying living life stages in that material before they emerge), or combinations of these treatments (Coulson and Witter 1984, Fettig and Hilszcza≈Ñski 2015). For suppression to be effective, accurate detection and survey methods are required to identify and delineate infestations prior to treatment. Prevention is designed to reduce the probability and severity of future infestations by manipulating forest conditions through thinning, prescribed burning, or alterations of age classes and species composition. There is considerable support for thinning of conifer forests to 106Disturbance and Sustainability in Forests of the Western United States reduce the severity of bark beetle infestations (Fettig and Hilszcza≈Ñski 2015, Fettig et al. 2007, but see Six et al. 2014).

‚Äúconservation‚Äù) could help mitigate alterations in boreal caribou
habitat for the entire RIA study area (Leblond et al. 2022).
Halting harvest activities in areas where habitat suitability is
currently high could help maintain high-quality habitat even
under the most intense climate change scenarios as opposed
to business-as-usual harvest (Fig. 5vi; ‚ÄúBaU‚Äù). Reducing harvest
levels was also shown to mitigate climate-induced decreases
in the probability of occurrence for caribou in central Quebec
(St-Laurent et al. 2022). Likewise, Labadie (2022) found that a
management scenario aiming at creating exclusive zones for
conservation, while other zones would experience alternativemanagement
strategies to increase the proportion of oldgrowth
stands, would help decrease caribou predation and
mortality regardless of radiative forcing.
These studies demonstrated that forest harvesting is a key
driving force in a caribou‚Äìmoose‚Äìwolf assemblage. Substantially
reducing harvest rates or protecting specific areas mitigated
the loss of old conifer andmixed forests favored by caribou,
irrespective of climate-induced increases in fire activity.
Conversely, high harvest levels coupled with increased fire
activity would increase young, nutrient-rich stands for other
ungulates (Potvin et al. 2005), exacerbating the vegetationdriven
apparent competition dynamic between moose and
caribou (Seip 1991; Wittmer et al. 2007; Frenette et al. 2020;
Labadie 2022).;The collaborative research work with the Abitibiwinni and
Ouje-Bougoumou First Nations (Fig. 1f) highlighted the benefits
that could be achieved from lowering harvest rates. Major
changes in forest structure and composition are expected
in the coming decades, and developing adaptation and mitigation
strategies could limit the effects of climate change
on Indigenous livelihoods and cultures. Indeed, we showed
that increasing harvest levels could accelerate the climateinduced
loss of good trapping habitats for marten (Figs. 5ix
and 5x, ‚ÄúIntensification‚Äù) in the northwestern part of our
study area, whereas opposite effects would be reached under
strict conservation (Figs. 5ix and 5x; ‚Äúconservation‚Äù). The
capacity of Indigenous communities to adapt to changing
environmental conditions has been demonstrated numerous
times in the past. However, there are limits on adaptive capacity,
and the factors that maintain it still need to be investigated
and documented. Strategies could include the valorization
of traditional knowledge associated with the forest
types that will be more prevalent in the future. Strategies
to limit fire hazards at culturally significant locations,
species, and infrastructure should also be considered. Moreover,
diversifying landscape values that guide forest management
to take into account Indigenous values is advised. More
generally, a step toward collaboration with Indigenous peoples
in land management is needed to face the challenges
of environmental change. Collaborations between First Nation
and provincial/territorial departments aiming at adapting
forest management to community values already exist in

d‚ÄôEspoir area using trap nets with 522 salmon caught
during the first year of operation. The highest catch
occurred in 1990 when 959 salmon were captured
(Dempson et al. 2004b). Fishing did not occur from
1994 to 1996, while 515 salmon were harvested in
1997. Excluding 1987 when only 18 salmon were
caught, the overall annual average catch was 522
salmon with the entire catch over the years the FSC
fishery operated accounting for 11% of the total
returns to Conne River. Regardless, there has been
no FSC fishery since 1998 as the Miawpukek First
Nation has chosen not to fish owing to ongoing con-
servation concerns. Therefore, given the continued
decline of Conne River salmon despite no FSC fishery
operating, the FSC fishery was not considered a cur-
rent threat to the Conne River salmon population.;; Atlantic salmon have been a primary food source
for the Mi‚Äôkmaq who have been present in this region
for several centuries (Martijn 2003), with the tradi-
tional rights to harvesting salmon for food from the
Conne River salmon population formalized in 1986 when the Miawpukek First Nation entered into an
agreement with Government of Canada (Hinks 2012).

been monitored at Conne River since 1986 using a

The timing of life history stages (phenology) of many insect species has already been demonstrably advanced by warming temperatures (Harrington et al. 2001; Logan et al. 2003), and there are growing examples of insect distributions extending northward (Parmesan 2006). Accordingly, there are reports of growing damage from some forest pests at the poleward and (or) alpine limits of their historical occurrences (e.g., Jepsen et al. 2008; Lima et al. 2008). Climate change may also affect pest populations through impacts on other organisms within the community. For instance, it is well known that climate can affect concentrations of secondary metabolites and nutrients in plants, with consequences for herbivores (Ayres 1993; Ayres and Lombardero 2000). Also, climate can affect natural enemies of insect pests (Burnett 1949) and ecologically important symbionts (Lombardero et al. 2003; Six and Bentz 2007). 

About pathogens: Direct effects of climate change on forest pathogens are likely to include (i) increased growth and reproduction; (ii) altered propagule dispersal, transmission rates, and infection phenology; and (iii) changes in overwinter survival. Indirect effects may include changes in (i) host nutrient status, resource allocation, and susceptibility to pathogen attack; (ii) distribution, life cycles, or phenology of insect associates or other vectors; (iii) the distribution of primary and alternate hosts; (iv) mismatches between adult tree location and optimal conditions, resulting in tree stress and increased disease susceptibility; and (v) the creation of novel community assemblages or mismatches between locally or regionally co-adapted genotypes that could enhance the potential for virulence. Climate change is almost certain to be a strong driver of evolutionary change in plant and pathogen populations (Harvell et al. 2002). Short generation time among pathogens relative to tree hosts allows a faster genetic response (Hafner et al. 1994; Brasier 2001). In general, introduced pathogens undergoing sustained population growth while encountering novel hosts should exhibit greater potential for rapid evolutionary response to changing abiotic conditions than native pathogens (Brasier 1995). Additionally, rapid evolution via interspecific hybridization in several fungal pathogens has recently been established, and contact between historically isolated genotypes facilitated by climate-induced range shifts could promote such hybridization (Brasier 2001).

Secondary prevention includes activities intended to prevent impacts from secondary exposures such as forest fires and declining water quality. These activities include maintenance of ecosystem services to the degree possible after the ecosystem is disturbed, as well as water treatment and strategies to prevent forest fires. Once pine beetle infestation has affected an area, secondary prevention should aim to control further spread and establishment of the beetle to prevent widespread tree die-off and to minimize ecosystem disruption as a result of the infestation.

3. Tertiary prevention includes symptom treatment and palliation. In the case of pine beetle infestation, it includes medical treatment of symptoms resulting from hazardous exposures such as forest fires. The need for tertiary prevention represents a public health failure to the extent that hazardous exposures were not prevented. However, although there is evidence that pine beetle infestations and associated hazardous exposures can be minimized, their incidence cannot be reduced completely; as health impacts are likely, provisions for tertiary prevention will be necessary.",No,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,1,154,165,

Various lines of evidence suggest that many NIS may be ‚Äúpoised to prosper‚Äù in a rapidly warming world, particularly in aquatic environments 

the re-distribution of Earth‚Äôs biota represents one of the most significant and underappreciated consequences of climate change, with numerous implications for human services and ecosystem functioning

The PNW is undergoing rapid climatic change and these trends are projected to continue as temperatures rise over the next century (Stewart et al. 2005; Pederson et al. 2011; Jiang et al. 2018). Simultaneously, human populations are growing quickly in the PNW. Concomitantly, increases in human activity such as international trade and travel, and human-altered environments, which are associated with increased rates of NIS introductions and establishment, are also increasing (Py≈°ek et al. 2010; Cardador and Blackburn 2019). Not surprisingly, this region is experiencing a proliferation of NIS, particularly in aquatic systems (Fig. 1), with some evidence that expansions are linked to climate-induced changes in temperature and precipitation (Muhlfeld et al. 2014; Al-Chokhachy et al. 2016; Snow et al. 2017). ","Air temperature directional change, Precipitation directional change, River water temperature; hydrology",PNW and surrounds. Some studies cited are in Montanna,"Retrospective studies focused on aquatic NIS in the PNW consistently found that climate change has facilitated the spatial expansion of multiple non-native fish species, including rainbow trout, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and carp. While publication bias may exist, only one study reported that climate change did not facilitate the range expansion of a focal aquatic NIS, the zebra mussel (Wilhelm and Adrian 2007). The primary drivers associated with NIS expansion in aquatic ecosystems included increases in water temperature and changes in hydrology. Climate-induced increases in air temperatures and reductions in precipitation increase water temperature (Caissie 2006) and alter streamflow regimes, which can shift the distribution of many aquatic species, particularly cold water species like salmonids (Kovach et al. 2016). These changes can directly affect the growth and survival of salmonid fishes, shift their distributions upstream as streams become too warm to inhabit (Wenger et al. 2011), and in some cases, shift a competitive advantage for a non-native species, as noted in several studies in our review. Several studies indicate that stream temperature increases are exacerbating biotic interactions by facilitating expansion of NIS into native fish habitats. For example, many populations of native cutthroat trout have been displaced from natal habitats through competitive interactions with introduced brook trout, brown trout (S. trutta), and rainbow trout (Wenger et al. 2011). In the Northern Rockies, recent summer temperature increases and decreases in spring precipitation appear to be allowing introduced invasive rainbow trout distributions to expand upstream, thereby enhancing the spread of invasive hybridization with native westslope cutthroat trout populations (Muhlfeld et al. 2014, 2017). Relative to cutthroat trout, rainbow trout prefer warmer temperatures, lower spring flows, and can tolerate greater environmental disturbance (Muhlfeld et al. 2014). Thus, periods of increased temperatures and reduced flows, such as experienced under drought, have probably allowed non-native rainbow trout to proliferate and hybridize with native cutthroat trout populations.

Retrospective empirical research describing climate change impacts on other focal NIS was sparse, but again, multiple studies suggest that climate change has facilitated the expansion of mammals (Snow et al. 2017), insects (R√©gni√®re et al. 2009), and plants (Bhattarai and Cronin 2014) through changes in temperature and precipitation regimes. The expansion of wild pigs was best explained by decreasing winter precipitation and decreasing winter and summer temperatures (Snow et al. 2017). Less snow cover allows greater foraging opportunities in one of the most challenging seasons. Gypsy moths have been limited in Canada by summer temperatures and suitable host plants even though initial expansion was rapid (R√©gni√®re et al. 2009) and storm events have facilitated colonization events through disturbance (Bhattarai and Cronin 2014). Such events may enhance long-distance dispersal of propagules as well. However, the terrestrial research also points to important complexity, where climate change has both facilitated and restricted the distribution of NIS (Monahan and Tingley 2012; Tobin et al. 2014). For example, summer temperatures could briefly exceed optimal development temperatures and facilitate gypsy moth larval development. However, this temperature effect tipped to lethality if either exposure duration or temperature increased (Tobin et al. 2014). Interestingly, observed patterns in aquatic and terrestrial environments are consistent with findings from a meta-analysis suggesting that climate change may often benefit aquatic NIS, but effects of climate change on terrestrial species will be more complex and context-specific (Sorte et al. 2013).

This is a good paper that cites a lot of good work.",,,Complex change,,,,,,,,,,USA -> CAN,,"Our synthesis revealed that some NIS responded favorably to changes in temperature and precipitation regimes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. However, there was a trend towards stronger responses of NIS expansion in aquatic ecosystems, suggesting that as climate change proceeds aquatic systems may be particularly vulnerable to invasion by NIS (Sorte et al. 2013). The more nuanced responses of terrestrial NIS suggest that understanding fine-scale climatic patterns may be necessary for understanding outcomes. Further, for NIS whose invasion relies on the existence of other species, such as insects with specific host requirements, the response of those other species to climate factors must also be considered. Nonetheless, climate model simulations forecast that the PNW will continue to trend towards warmer drier summers, reduced precipitation and snowpack, reduced summer flows, increased late summer drought, warmer water temperatures, and increased extreme events (e.g., flooding, wildfire, and drought), with important implications for the spread of NIS in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.",,Complex change,Complex change,,,Complex change,Complex change,,,,,,Complex change,,,,,"Riparian, Rivers, Lakes and ponds, Temperate forest",,No change (measured),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This paper mentions NCP in the intro but does not follow up in the discussion and does not really talk about NCP when discussing the empirical results from papers.,,,No change (measured),,,,,,,,air temp/precip/water temp change > change to some limit of invasive species biology > change in population dynamics > increased range/decreased range/changed range,No,does some hand waving but nothing specific,No,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,1,132,138,

Peoples of the Arctic perceive strong bonds with the natural environment in which they live, a world view that integrates their way

(Inuit Circumpolar Council Alaska, 2020). In this special issue, Knopp

freshwater biodiversity included greater spatial coverage of fish observations with additional species that were absent in the CBMPFreshwater database. Documented Indigenous Knowledge included 
widespread observations of a number of freshwater habitat shifts, 
such as permafrost thaw and changes to ice on/ice off regimes, consistent with predicted impacts of climate change. Recognising the importance of Indigenous observations and methodologies to monitor 
landscape change, it is important to develop ways of engagement that 
are founded on mutual sharing of knowledge (Wong et al., 2020; Woo

rather than attempting to integrate Indigenous Knowledge into 
western science frameworks recognises both ways of knowing as 
independent and unique, and mobilises the knowledge from both 
systems while retaining that independence (Henri et al., 2021; Teng√∂

the design and implementation of monitoring must include adequate 
financial compensation for participants to support their contribution

""""Declines in these endemic helminth zoonoses are in part a consequence of changes in dietary preference and availability of processed foods, and the passing of sled dogs as a primary method of transportation in the North.

Another success story is the impact of regular anthelminthic treatment of dogs on St Lawrence Island, Alaska, which led to significant reductions in prevalence of alveolar hydatid cysts in rodents as an indicator of environmental egg contamination (Rausch et al., 1990b). In many northern and Indigenous communities, however, access to veterinary medical and veterinary public health services remains a challenge (Brook et al., 2010; Jenkins et al., 2011).

‚ÄúAs environmental conditions change, bacterial infections routinely reported from direct contact with, or ingestion of, fish in more southern regions may also become a greater concern for northern communities who depend on fish for subsistence and as part of their food sovereignty (126). While there are currently no known zoonotic viruses of fish origin, there are many viruses among fish that share evolutionary history with modern human viral pathogens, and viruses have been shown to readily jump between species in the aquatic environment (308).‚Äù ([Keatts et al., 2021, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/PVZXHQ2N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S2QN44SA?page=13&annotation=K2CU8N9Q))

‚ÄúFor many Indigenous cultures around the Arctic, wildlife as food, and food sharing, are fundamental components of a cultural value system that emphasizes generosity, reciprocity, and cooperation, and usually operates within networks related to kinship and family social groups within the community (261‚Äì267). Alaska prohibits the sale of most wildlife hunted by Alaska Natives to non-Alaska Natives, but, across Canada, different jurisdictions recognize different Indigenous rights and responsibilities with respect to disposition of country food. For example, in Nunavut, an Inuk has the right to dispose freely to any person any wildlife lawfully harvested (268). Food exchanges are important because of the nutritional value of the items exchanged, and also because they carry cultural and economic values (53, 269, 270).‚Äù ([Keatts et al., 2021, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/PVZXHQ2N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S2QN44SA?page=11&annotation=9ADWGRSE))

‚ÄúLocal sharing of foods can facilitate community zoonotic disease outbreaks (e.g., trichinella or botulism, as noted in Table 2); however, the limited potential for human-to-human transmission of current pathogens spread via sharing, and the low human population density, makes the likelihood of epidemics and pandemics originating from such activities very low. While this traditional way of sharing remains, there also exist other broader networks of sharing practices established to support urban hubs such as Anchorage, and others, across the United States (265, 266). Although low levels of consumption and sharing of traditional foods by Indigenous Peoples in urban centers in Canada have been previously reported (64, 271), relatively new sharing networks have emerged as a result of social media (272, 273) that facilitate the broader distribution of country food, often at the expense of local and traditional sharing practices and values (274), and potentially facilitating the spread of pathogens across larger geographic regions.‚Äù ([Keatts et al., 2021, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/PVZXHQ2N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S2QN44SA?page=11&annotation=Z4NK6PQQ))","Climate change (generic), Sea temperature change",,"bacterial infections routinely reported from direct contact with, or ingestion of, fish in more southern regions may also become a greater concern for northern communities who depend on fish for subsistence and as part of their food sovereignty """"",Increase,,Complex change,,,,,,,,,USA <-> CAN <-> first peoples,"OTHER - described in above short answer question, specify directionality",,"While there are currently no known zoonotic viruses of fish origin, there are many viruses among fish that share evolutionary history with modern human viral pathogens, and viruses have been shown to readily jump between species in the aquatic environment (308).‚Äù",,,,,Complex change,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coastal marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Complex Change,,,,,,,,fish for subsistence,"‚ÄúAs environmental conditions change, bacterial infections routinely reported from direct contact with, or ingestion of, fish in more southern regions may also become a greater concern for northern communities who depend on fish for subsistence and as part of their food sovereignty (126).

",,,Decrease,,,,,,"Yes, this change would especially impact northern communities who depend on fish for subsistence","While this flow does not have an explicit cross-boundary flow, the context of the paper clearly implies it, as the focus of the paper is on subsistence communities in the arctic, which are primarily indigenous.

Climate change may lead to range expansions of fish from more southern regions to more northern regions. These fish are more likely to carry bacterial infections, and may impact northern communities who depend on fish for subsistence. There is the potential for disease transmission, although this has not been documented (this is a theoretical flow).  There is the potential for subsequent spread through sharing of foods (potentially transboundary)",Yes,"
‚ÄúRisk for emergence of zoonotic-origin pandemic pathogens from wildlife use in Arctic and boreal biomes is currently minimal, indicating that new policies restricting these traditional and subsistence activities in the name of pandemic prevention would be unfounded at the current time.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn general, there has been minimal research on the risks associated with traditional and country food preparation practices, despite awareness of zoonotic pathogens found in harvested wildlife and a clear need for risk reduction (118). Good hygiene during butchering and skinning, and thorough cooking of food can prevent transmission of many of the endemic zoonotic pathogens reported (118).‚Äù 

‚ÄúEnsuring ownership of health initiatives by local communities in general, and specifically in the necessary prioritization process, is essential, with ample evidence demonstrating that failure to engage and build trust with local political and thought leaders, Elders, traditional health workers, and community groups in disease detection and control, will delay both diagnosis and response for emerging diseases (330).

‚ÄúRich knowledge, including on preventing certain food-borne illness, results from the long-standing relationships of Indigenous Peoples and local communities with their environment, including their harvesting of nutritionally and spiritually important native plants, fish, and wildlife (56, 57, 118, 339, 340). Indigenous knowledge; the prevention, monitoring, and surveillance of zoonotic agents; and education are considered the most important methods to reduce human health risks associated with the consumption of traditional and country foods (118).‚Äù

‚ÄúIn general, parasites, lesions (discoloration, tracts, fungal growths, etc.), or abnormal behavior of hunted animals are often observed by Indigenous and local communities. Indigenous Peoples were some of the first to draw attention to traditional and country food safety concerns related to environmental contaminants, because of changes they detected in quality of the animals and fish they hunted (118).‚Äù 
‚ÄúRecent working groups assessing Unusual Mortality Events (UMEs) for marine mammals and other species around Alaska include Indigenous perspectives and observations (191, 342) and, across Canada, several Indigenous-led Guardians Programs monitor ecological health, maintain cultural sites, and protect sensitive areas and species, while also playing a vital role in creating conservation plans, and supporting Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas (343)‚Äù ([

‚ÄúIt is important that the desire to increase awareness of the potential risk of zoonotic infections be balanced with the unintended consequences on other determinants of health. Past experience with poorly designed communication strategies and materials with respect to country and traditional foods, such as contaminants in wild-caught foods, provides stark lessons on the need to avoid provoking unnecessary fear when addressing food safety risk in Indigenous and local communities (71, 72). For example, scientific communication to Nunavut Inuit communities in the late 1980s that women‚Äôs breast milk had high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), failed to consider broader understanding of contamination issues in the region, and failed to include the Inuit directly on messaging (72). The resulting alarm and confusion across Inuit and other northern communities led many women to stop breastfeeding, and stopped consumption of country and traditional foods, leading to other more insidious health issues, poor nutrition, and food insecurity (72).‚Äù ",Yes,Arctic & northern communities; not often listed by name,"Too much content to fit in text box, google didn't like it.

",,,Decrease,,,,,,"Yes, this change would especially impact northern communities who depend on fish for subsistence","While this flow does not have an explicit cross-boundary flow, the context of the paper clearly implies it, as the focus of the paper is on subsistence communities in the arctic, which are primarily indigenous.

Climate change may lead to range expansions of fish from more southern regions to more northern regions. These fish are more likely to carry bacterial infections, and may impact northern communities who depend on fish for subsistence. There is the potential for disease transmission, although this has not been documented (this is a theoretical flow).  There is the potential for subsequent spread through sharing of foods (potentially transboundary)",Yes,"
‚ÄúRisk for emergence of zoonotic-origin pandemic pathogens from wildlife use in Arctic and boreal biomes is currently minimal, indicating that new policies restricting these traditional and subsistence activities in the name of pandemic prevention would be unfounded at the current time.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn general, there has been minimal research on the risks associated with traditional and country food preparation practices, despite awareness of zoonotic pathogens found in harvested wildlife and a clear need for risk reduction (118). Good hygiene during butchering and skinning, and thorough cooking of food can prevent transmission of many of the endemic zoonotic pathogens reported (118).‚Äù 

‚ÄúEnsuring ownership of health initiatives by local communities in general, and specifically in the necessary prioritization process, is essential, with ample evidence demonstrating that failure to engage and build trust with local political and thought leaders, Elders, traditional health workers, and community groups in disease detection and control, will delay both diagnosis and response for emerging diseases (330).

‚ÄúRich knowledge, including on preventing certain food-borne illness, results from the long-standing relationships of Indigenous Peoples and local communities with their environment, including their harvesting of nutritionally and spiritually important native plants, fish, and wildlife (56, 57, 118, 339, 340). Indigenous knowledge; the prevention, monitoring, and surveillance of zoonotic agents; and education are considered the most important methods to reduce human health risks associated with the consumption of traditional and country foods (118).‚Äù

‚ÄúIn general, parasites, lesions (discoloration, tracts, fungal growths, etc.), or abnormal behavior of hunted animals are often observed by Indigenous and local communities. Indigenous Peoples were some of the first to draw attention to traditional and country food safety concerns related to environmental contaminants, because of changes they detected in quality of the animals and fish they hunted (118).‚Äù 
‚ÄúRecent working groups assessing Unusual Mortality Events (UMEs) for marine mammals and other species around Alaska include Indigenous perspectives and observations (191, 342) and, across Canada, several Indigenous-led Guardians Programs monitor ecological health, maintain cultural sites, and protect sensitive areas and species, while also playing a vital role in creating conservation plans, and supporting Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas (343)‚Äù ([

‚ÄúIt is important that the desire to increase awareness of the potential risk of zoonotic infections be balanced with the unintended consequences on other determinants of health. Past experience with poorly designed communication strategies and materials with respect to country and traditional foods, such as contaminants in wild-caught foods, provides stark lessons on the need to avoid provoking unnecessary fear when addressing food safety risk in Indigenous and local communities (71, 72). For example, scientific communication to Nunavut Inuit communities in the late 1980s that women‚Äôs breast milk had high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), failed to consider broader understanding of contamination issues in the region, and failed to include the Inuit directly on messaging (72). The resulting alarm and confusion across Inuit and other northern communities led many women to stop breastfeeding, and stopped consumption of country and traditional foods, leading to other more insidious health issues, poor nutrition, and food insecurity (72).‚Äù ",Yes,Arctic & northern communities; not often listed by name,"Too much content to fit in text box, google didn't like it.

Macrophyte beds are also important sources of production for coastal food webs, as well as habitat for numerous species. For example, exported kelp carbon plays an important role in supporting Arctic benthic food webs (Petrowski et al., 2016; Vilas et al., 2020).

Statistics indicate that six out of ten infectious diseases arise from animal to human transmission with global prevalence [25]. Such transmissions may occur in urban or rural areas [29].
Zoonotic diseases, such as those spread by mosquitoes and other related vectors, have increased in recent years. The rise in global temperatures has created favorable conditions for breeding specific vectors, especially in poorly developed countries [30]. Additionally, the increased precipitation and parallel flooding conditions in certain areas provide the perfect breeding grounds for vectors. Flooding conditions amplify the possibility of waterborne disease transmission [31].
In Russia, climate change significantly affects the spread of diseases. The increased incidence of zoonotic disease is attributed to fluctuating temperatures, causing prolonged periods of vegetation growth and broadening habitat availability, thereby allowing zoonotic pathogens and related vectors to have more suitable living conditions that promote survival and reproduction. Furthermore, increased temperature is causing the melting of permafrost in the area, leading to the concern that the permafrost degradation will expose ancient human burial sites and result in the revival of vectors that spread deadly infections [32].
Climate change can also influence the geographical distribution of insect spread diseases [33]. Zoonotic viruses previously localized to areas with high temperatures, such as the tropics, have been observed worldwide, having spread to subtropical climates and areas with high altitudes. Climate change has caused temperature changes in various geographical regions, meaning that areas previously free from certain diseases now see rises in infection prevalence. Furthermore, climate change is causing people‚Äôs general health to deteriorate, making it easier for zoonotic infection to spread [33], as seen with the Zika and dengue viruses, which are now global threats [34,35]. Additionally, in less developed areas, the increase in droughts and flooding has cut freshwater availability, which causes humans to ingest water contaminated with zoonotic waterborne diseases, such as schistosomiasis [36,37,38].
Aside from this, the changes in climatic conditions have forced pathogens and vectors to develop adaptation mechanisms. Such development has resulted in the diseases becoming resistant to conventional treatments due to their augmented resilience and survival techniques, thus further favoring the spread of infection [32]. In some contexts, changes in climate conditions may help to increase the resistance of microbes, such as bacteria and viruses, making treatment more difficult and contributing to an increase in the disease spread.        Climate change causes variations in temperature, rainfall patterns, and climate disaster incidence, influencing the global population‚Äôs transmission of diseases and affecting the transmission rates of various vector-borne diseases [30,31].

Temperature is one of the most important factors controlling the geographic distribution of seaweeds, and their tolerances to high (summer maxima) and low (winter minima) temperatures generally define their biogeographical boundaries (Luning, 1984, van den Hoek and Luning, 1988, van den Hoek et al., 1990, Adey and Steneck, 2001).

A question that is often asked is: might climate change enable exotic MBDs (mosquito borne-diseases) to emerge and become established in Canada? ","Climate change (generic), Air temperature directional change, Precipitation directional change, Drought",Northern Canada," Warmer temperature, higher humidity and increased precipitation will facilitate the lifecycle of exotic mosquitoes by supporting larval development and survival and extending adult lifespan, thus increasing overall population size (42‚Äì45). Climate change is also expected to influence disease transmission via several mechanisms: ‚Ä¢ Reducing egg development time in recently-fed adult female mosquitoes, thus reducing the time between blood meals and increasing feeding frequency (42,43,46) ‚Ä¢ Shortening the extrinsic incubation period, thereby allowing mosquitoes to become infectious faster (42,43,45‚Äì48) ‚Ä¢ Increasing mosquito longevity, enabling infectious mosquitoes to bite more people (44). As temperatures in Canada become milder and humidity and precipitation increase, larger parts of Canada will become climatically suitable for the establishment of some exotic mosquitoes that are currently limited to the tropics and subtropics (3,49,50).

A question that is often asked is: might climate change enable exotic MBDs (mosquito borne-diseases) to emerge and become established in Canada? ","Climate change (generic), Air temperature directional change, Precipitation directional change, Drought",Northern Canada," Warmer temperature, higher humidity and increased precipitation will facilitate the lifecycle of exotic mosquitoes by supporting larval development and survival and extending adult lifespan, thus increasing overall population size (42‚Äì45). Climate change is also expected to influence disease transmission via several mechanisms: ‚Ä¢ Reducing egg development time in recently-fed adult female mosquitoes, thus reducing the time between blood meals and increasing feeding frequency (42,43,46) ‚Ä¢ Shortening the extrinsic incubation period, thereby allowing mosquitoes to become infectious faster (42,43,45‚Äì48) ‚Ä¢ Increasing mosquito longevity, enabling infectious mosquitoes to bite more people (44). As temperatures in Canada become milder and humidity and precipitation increase, larger parts of Canada will become climatically suitable for the establishment of some exotic mosquitoes that are currently limited to the tropics and subtropics (3,49,50).

accumulation can have long-term negative effects on the ecosystem

endocrine systems of aquatic wildlife while also altering biodiversity in

higher trophic levels, including humans who consume fish and other
aquatic organisms (Windsor et al., 2017). This highlights the signifi

reduce the impacts caused by POPs released from landfills into water
environments. Challenges associated with identifying reliable tracers for
MSW landfill leachate are regularly reported. Sediment sampled from
the Laurentian Great Lakes basin contain POPs from legacy release from
industrial point sources and atmospheric deposition but are also
contaminated with current-use POPs and emerging contaminants. The
Laurentian Great Lakes continue to receive large direct inputs of currentuse POPs, namely PBDEs and perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs),
particularly perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic
acid (PFOA). However, the region was, and continues to be, subjected to
intensive industrial pressures (Helm et al., 2011) that can convolute
identification of point source polluters. Wastewater treatment plants are
repeatedly implicated as point sources of POPs transformation products
via effluent into receiving aquatic systems. Parent compound concen
trations are often considered, but further focus is needed to address the
proportion of contamination represented by the transformation

The bass are highly piscivorous and there is concern that they could have a negative impact on native fishes (Courtenay 1997). The species was introduced into southern Florida canals based largely on the rationale that cold winter temperatures would prevent it from spreading elsewhere (Shafland 1995).

Reservoir and canal construction were viewed as a sign of progress during European settlement of North America. In the last few decades, however, the attention has shifted to the negative aspects of reservoirs, and dam removal is now viewed as a sign of ecologically forward thinking. Nevertheless, the pendulum may shift again as policy makers view increased water storage as a necessary option for dealing with water shortages caused by human population growth and exacerbated by climate change (Limerick 2003). Although large reservoirs are rarely constructed in North America now, the area of the United States covered by impoundments continues to increase by about 1% per year, mainly due to construction of small impoundments (Downing et al. 2006).

Their conclusion:
The ability of species to persist in the long term is highly dependent on their geographical range and dispersal ability [20, 24, 119], and traits such as restricted range and ecological specialisation can act synergistically with climate change to increase extinction risk [117]. 

An example:
 The Micronesia forest skink Emoia boettgeri is endemic to Marshall Islands and has the most limited range of the 11 species of lizards (six geckos, five skinks) found on reef islands of Micronesia [84, 85]. Climate change impacts such as sea level rise, increased storm frequency and intensity, and saltwater intrusion destroy the lizard's critical forest habitat [9]. The restricted area of the coral atolls provides limited opportunities for this species to accommodate any changes in climate (Fig. 3b). The main option available to species on coral atolls is to shift to neighbouring atolls which might have some favourable habitat, but such range shifts are difficult given the vast expense of ocean between islands. Additionally, species from the Emoia genus have an extremely limited capacity for active overwater dispersal, relying mainly on chance events such as rafting on floating debris.

Weather phenomena induced or exacerbated by climate change often coincide with increases in activity of disease vectors. For example, floods are some of the most devastating disasters induced by climate change in terms of physical damage and their ability to activate key disease vectors, such as mosquitos and wastewater exposure. Effectively predicting and monitoring these events is crucial in order to maintain global health. These phenomena are incredibly complex with many factors to consider but AI/ML can offer a pathway to effectively predicting floods and monitoring their effects (28).
