","Climate change (generic), Air temperature directional change",The Yukon River - headwaters begin in British Columbia (BC) where it flows into the central Yukon curving into Alaska and finally discharging into the Bering Sea,"Evidence suggests that freshwater flow from the Arctic’s major rivers is increasing as average air temperatures rise (Peterson et al. 2002). Alterations in flow is one vulnerability associated with climate change that could subsequently alter pH of the Yukon River and its tributaries, influencing the solubility and chemical speciation of the various constituents, particularly metals (Environment Yukon 2011). [...] Changes in stream flow have occurred in the Yukon River at Whitehorse and on the tributaries of the Stewart, Tanana, Takhini, Salcha, and Porcupine Rivers (Table 1:1.12, 1.13).;; There is agreement that DOC will increase as temperatures warm and flows increase but the persistence of the increase (how long it will occur) is unknown. ;; Suspended sediment concentrations in the Yukon River have increased as water yields have increased (Table 1.18).;; Atmospheric currents are key pathways for long-range transport of contaminants (heavy metals, organic pollutants, radionuclides) from industrial and agricultural sources to Arctic regions (Hinck et al. 2004). Global air transport is an important source of pollutant loadings to the Yukon River basin. Deposition over forming ice creates a storage and transport mechanism to the aquatic system. Typically these contaminants bioaccumulate in organisms and Arctic food chains. Hg, for example, is a key metal transported through the atmosphere to the Yukon and has been quantified in snowmelt and correlated with tissue burdens of Hg in northern pike and longnose sucker (Hinck et al. 2004).;; ",Increase,,,,Increase,,,,Complex change,,Complex change,"Changes in permafrost coverage affects groundwater and river flow dynamics and affects biogeochemical loads and can affect the Yukons river productivity through altering C and nutrient cycling also while there are other sources of heavy metals that are cited in this study (mining, military activity etc) global air transport and deposition of contaminants - such as Hg and Toxaphene organic pollutants etc are deposited in the ice - which when it melts brings these pollutants into the water.
