In Canada, the functional definition of the North corresponds well with health indicator peer groups E, F, and H as determined by Statistics Canada based on demographic parameters and socioeconomic characteristics. These peer groups include the northern regions of the western provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), the northern territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut), northern Ontario, northern Quebec (Nunavik and the James Bay region), and Labrador. Collectively, the population in these peer groups is about 1.9 million people, representing 5.5% of the entire Canadian population, and is characterised by a high proportion of Indigenous people (First Nations, Metis, and Inuit) (http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-221-x/2011002/regions/hrt4-eng.htm). In Canada, Inuit living in Nunavut, Nunavik (in northern Quebec), and Nunatsiavut (in Labrador) represent 84–90% of the total population in these regions, and 55% of the population in the Inuvialuit region of the Northwest Territories. Based on 2006 census data, First Nations (primarily Cree, and Dene in northwestern Canada) represent 76–97% of the population in northern Quebec (James Bay), Saskatchewan, and Manitoba (http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/as-sa/97-558/index-eng.cfm). It is important to note that northern residents are a diverse population, and generalisations about cultural and dietary preferences rarely apply from community to community, let alone across all of North America.""""","Basically some dietary profiles of different communities","Socio-cultural, IK","",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,1,139,149,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

the Laurentian Great Lakes basin contain POPs from legacy release from
industrial point sources and atmospheric deposition but are also

Laurentian Great Lakes continue to receive large direct inputs of currentuse POPs, namely PBDEs and perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs),
particularly perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic
acid (PFOA). However, the region was, and continues to be, subjected to

repeatedly implicated as point sources of POPs transformation products
