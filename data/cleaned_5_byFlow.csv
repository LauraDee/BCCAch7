predicted to increase the total North American range size (Gray, 2004).

Despite predictions from a detailed climatic suitability map for gypsy
moth in North America (Gray, 2004), climate has been shown to pose
unexpected limits to the gypsy moth range edge. For example, the patterns of range edge dynamics in eastern Virginia, characterized by overall
stasis and range retraction with high temporal variability (Figure 3), were
unexpected given the suitability of winter climate in the southeastern
United States for gypsy moth. Spread rates in this region were found
to be negatively correlated to hours of spring/summer temperature
above optimal for gypsy moth growth (Tobin et al., 2014).","","","","","","","","Increase","","","","","USA -> CAN","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.11.010","Gypsy moth is a generalist feeder of broad-leafed trees, with aspen, birch, oak, and

Unabated spread of gypsy moth and the economic costs associated
with increasing forest damage and management in the 1980s led to
the implementation of the STS programme as the lead initiative for
invasion front management (Roberts & Ziegler, 2007; Sharov, Leonard,
Liebhold, Roberts, & Dickerson, 2002).

However, given the susceptibility of the next tier of states in advance of the invasion front in the 1990s, where 50%–80% of forested land was classified as highly at
risk (Morin et al., 2004), it was recognized that slowing the spread
was not only economically viable but also highly beneficial (McManus,
2007).","","Increase","","","","","","","","Rising temperatures increased the rate of spread of gypsy moth (which is now referred to as spongy moth, fyi) including from US to Canada.","Yes","Monitoring and local suppression:

The management objective of the STS programme is to reduce
spread rates of gypsy moth through monitoring and local suppression
of isolated populations beyond the advancing front. Monitoring is
achieved by annually trapping males using delta or milk carton style
traps that are baited with disparlure, the synthetic version of the gypsy
moth pheromone, and deploying the traps in an extensive spatially referenced grid both along and ahead of the invasion front (Sharov et al., 2002). The trapping programme focuses on the “transition zone” between the generally infested area, where populations are established, and the uninfested area (Liebhold, Sharov, & Tobin, 2007; Figure 2).","No","","","","",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,1,2

other mammalian herbivores, frequent wildfires triggered by lightening, and fires intentionally set by Indigenous peoples were the
major sources of disturbance in North American grasslands. Indigenous peoples
in North America practiced various forms of nomadic pastoralism
and regularly applied fire in sophisticated ways to maintain habitat
suitable for hunting, promote desirable plant species, and control
pests;

Greater inclusivity to make such programs available
to Indigenous landowners and incorporation of Indigenous leadership and traditional ecological knowledge could help to expand the
reach of these efforts to Indigenous land;

The associated vicariance promoted neutral genetic divergence as a direct evolutionary consequence of random genetic drift within refugial populations and low gene flow among them (Fig. 2, Hewitt 2000, 2004). At the end of the last glaciation, some of these genetically differentiated refugial populations (glacial lineages) expanded to colonize previously inhospitable habitats. Phylogeographic inferences regarding glacial refugia and postglacial migration pathways rely on the extant spatial distribution of genetic polymorphisms in the context of geographic barriers for dispersal (e.g., water bodies, mountain chains, deserts, glaciers) (Fig. 2). In plants, these inferences are often strengthened with pollen and macrofossil evidence (e.g., Magri et al. 2006, de Lafontaine et al. 2014a).  Author Manuscript In addition to unraveling the historical biogeography of a wide range of taxa, phylogeographic surveys published over the past 15 years have better characterized the erosion of genetic diversity along migration routes. Postglacial range expansions occur primarily through dispersal of the populations located near the expanding edge of the refugial distribution. The newly established populations are initially small and susceptible to random genetic drift. As a result of founder effects at the expanding edge during the course of migration, a reduction of molecular genetic diversity is expected within the newly colonized area as it harbors only a subset of the original gene pool of refugial populations (Ibrahim et al. 1996, Slatkin and Excoffier 2012). Although a poleward erosion of genetic diversity should be expected when considering a given genetic lineage along its migration route, regions of high intrapopulation genetic diversity but low interpopulation differentiation have often been reported at mid-latitudes (Petit et al. 2003, Hampe and Petit 2005).","Increase","Increase","Increase","","","","","Increase","Complex change","","","","USA -> CAN, CAN -> USA","","Prolonged isolation in distinct glacial refugia may have resulted in disproportionately high levels of genetic differentiation among refugial populations, leading to high levels of regional genetic diversity despite low levels of intrapopulation diversity and a lack of isolation-by-distance (Hampe and Petit 2005, de Lafontaine et al. 2013). Thus, populations in glacial refugia are also expected to contain a relatively high abundance of endemic and ancestral variants, which may be lost during colonization through random genetic drift and repeated founder effects (Petit et al. 2003). As a result, genetic and geographic distances are often correlated positively along migration pathways, reflecting the long-lasting genetic gradient generated by serial founder events or surfing (i.e., genetic drift occurring at the wave front of an expanding population, Excoffier and Ray 2008) during postglacial range colonization (de Lafontaine et al. 2013).

Climate change is also expected to influence disease transmission via several mechanisms: • Reducing egg development time in recently-fed adult female mosquitoes, thus reducing the time between blood meals and increasing feeding frequency (42,43,46) • Shortening the extrinsic incubation period, thereby allowing mosquitoes to become infectious faster (42,43,45–48) • Increasing mosquito longevity, enabling infectious mosquitoes to bite more people (44). As temperatures in Canada become milder and humidity and precipitation increase, larger parts of Canada will become climatically suitable for the establishment of some exotic mosquitoes that are currently limited to the tropics and subtropics (3,49,50). Furthermore, as the winters become shorter and summers become longer, the duration of climatic suitability for disease transmission will increase, allowing autochthonous transmission of exotic MBDs for a limited period in some regions of Canada (49). For exotic MBDs that are zoonoses and require an animal reservoir that is currently present in Canada (e.g. Japanese encephalitis), climate change could have further impact on the reservoir such as maintaining and supporting the expansion of natural habitats and prolonging the availability of food sources, thus increasing population size (51,52).

Conversely, the association between phytoplasmas and host plants is temperature-dependent, where warmer temperatures accelerate bacterial multiplication, leading to an earlier expression of symptoms and higher chances of transmission by the vector during feeding (Foissac and Wilson 2010, Salar et al. 2013, Maggi et al. 2014, Sabato et al. 2020). Another layer of complexity to consider when studying insect-transmitted pathogens is the arrival of new plant pathogens due to invasive leafhopper invasions. For phytoplasmas, there are several examples of phytoplasma strains belonging to different groups and subgroups moving among distant geographic locations through their vector, such as the phytoplasma associated with maize bushy stunt disease distributed from Argentina to Mexico in correspondence with the distribution of its insect vector, the corn leafhopper Dalbulus maidis (Pérez-López et al. 2016, Foresti et al. 2022).","Increase","","Complex change","","Increase","","","","Complex change","Increase","","","USA -> CAN, CAN -> USA","","Additionally, temperature is the main factor driving Nearctic leafhopper population distribution and size (Plante et al. 2023).

Generally, warmer and wetter conditions have been regarded as beneficial to fungal development and reproduction while increasing the probability of northward migration of pathogens from southern latitudes (Broders et al., 2015). Temperatures in the northeastern U.S. have risen at a rate of 0.25 °C per decade since 1970 and are projected to warm by 2.9–5.3 °C through 2070–2099 (Dukes et al., 2009, Hayhoe et al., 2007).

Modeling of seasonal climatic indices found the cumulative precipitation from May–July was the strongest single predictor variable for WPND outbreak severity of the following year, coinciding with fruiting body development and spore dispersal (Wyka et al., 2017a).

The Iroquoians of the Saint Lawrence Valley considered it a “Tree of Peace” (Quenneville, 2007). Eastern white pine was a key component of daily living such that the resin, bark, wood, and needles were used for construction, food, and medicine (Krochmal et al., 1969). This tree is also an integral part of Native Americans’ traditional stories and myths, and art forms (Asselin, 2015). At the time of European Settlement, eastern white pine trees captured the imagination of many European explorers, naturalists, and writers. Currently, eastern white pine is the state tree of Maine and Michigan, U.S., the provincial tree of Ontario, Canada, and it continues to be an important cultural icon for eastern North American forests (Ontario-MNRF., 2014, USDA-USNA., 2016).","Western societies utilize white pines for logging, it is unclear to what extent Indigenous peoples still have access to their 'cultural keystone species' but it is implied that access is reduced","Warmer temperatures, and in some cases increased precipitation, seems to be driving an increase in fungal pathogen infection in North America. Because the range of white pines cross borders (as do some of the disease vectors), increase parasite densities in one region can impact the whole system.","Yes","Management strategies for decreasing threats to eastern white pine health will improve as more is learned about the system, but presently there are some simple silvicultural recommendations that may increase the resilience of eastern white pine. For example, emphasizing site selection and reducing competition may reduce the tree’s vulnerability to stress agents. Sites should be selected that avoid factors that restrict rooting depth within 30 cm of the surface, such as plow pans and bedrock, to avoid drought-induced mortality (Livingston and Kenefic, 2018 this issue). Sites with excessively drained soils should also be avoided (Munck et al., 2016), as well as sites with better soils favoring hardwood competition (Lancaster and Leak, 1978) or Ribes spp. (Ostry et al., 2010). Because regenerating eastern white pine under a canopy helps reduce the risk of white pine weevil and white pine blister rust, the recommended silvicultural approach of sheltherwood cuts for regenerating eastern white pine (Lancaster and Leak, 1978) on properly selected sites will likely help reduce the risk of future health issues.
Stand densities may also be frequently regulated. At early stages, it is best to maintain dense stands to minimize white pine weevil damage, but then to thin stands as soon as trees reach 6 m in height, according to recommended stocking levels (Katovich and Mielke, 1993, Leak and Lamson, 1999, Seymour, 2007). Intermediate thinning treatments may include removal of poor-vigor trees from lower crown classes (Livingston and Kenefic, 2018 this issue). Thinned stands will increase sunlight and temperature in the canopy, which may decrease moisture and reduce optimal fungal growing conditions for C. pinea and WPND fungi. Another useful management strategy is to harvest in the winter if stands have Caliciopsis canker or WPND to avoid spreading inoculum.","No","itcisakik Algonquin community of Canada, Menominee community of northern Wisconsin,  Iroquoians of the Saint Lawrence Valley, Native Americans (broadly)","Eastern white pine is considered a “cultural keystone species” that greatly shaped the identity of Native American Tribes and European settlers (Uprety et al., 2013).

Statistics indicate that six out of ten infectious diseases arise from animal to human transmission with global prevalence [25]. Such transmissions may occur in urban or rural areas [29].
Zoonotic diseases, such as those spread by mosquitoes and other related vectors, have increased in recent years. The rise in global temperatures has created favorable conditions for breeding specific vectors, especially in poorly developed countries [30]. Additionally, the increased precipitation and parallel flooding conditions in certain areas provide the perfect breeding grounds for vectors. Flooding conditions amplify the possibility of waterborne disease transmission [31].
In Russia, climate change significantly affects the spread of diseases. The increased incidence of zoonotic disease is attributed to fluctuating temperatures, causing prolonged periods of vegetation growth and broadening habitat availability, thereby allowing zoonotic pathogens and related vectors to have more suitable living conditions that promote survival and reproduction. Furthermore, increased temperature is causing the melting of permafrost in the area, leading to the concern that the permafrost degradation will expose ancient human burial sites and result in the revival of vectors that spread deadly infections [32].
Climate change can also influence the geographical distribution of insect spread diseases [33]. Zoonotic viruses previously localized to areas with high temperatures, such as the tropics, have been observed worldwide, having spread to subtropical climates and areas with high altitudes. Climate change has caused temperature changes in various geographical regions, meaning that areas previously free from certain diseases now see rises in infection prevalence. Furthermore, climate change is causing people’s general health to deteriorate, making it easier for zoonotic infection to spread [33], as seen with the Zika and dengue viruses, which are now global threats [34,35]. Additionally, in less developed areas, the increase in droughts and flooding has cut freshwater availability, which causes humans to ingest water contaminated with zoonotic waterborne diseases, such as schistosomiasis [36,37,38].
Aside from this, the changes in climatic conditions have forced pathogens and vectors to develop adaptation mechanisms. Such development has resulted in the diseases becoming resistant to conventional treatments due to their augmented resilience and survival techniques, thus further favoring the spread of infection [32]. In some contexts, changes in climate conditions may help to increase the resistance of microbes, such as bacteria and viruses, making treatment more difficult and contributing to an increase in the disease spread.        Climate change causes variations in temperature, rainfall patterns, and climate disaster incidence, influencing the global population’s transmission of diseases and affecting the transmission rates of various vector-borne diseases [30,31].

Despite the already large impact of vector-borne diseases on global public health, morbidity and mortality will likely increase in the coming decades due to a now more rapidly-changing climate. Broad changes in temperature, wetness, and vegetation will all affect the prevalence of mosquitoes and the diseases they carry and drive them into entirely new geographic areas. Weather phenomena induced or exacerbated by climate change often coincide with increases in activity of disease vectors. For example, floods are some of the most devastating disasters induced by climate change in terms of physical damage and their ability to activate key disease vectors, such as mosquitos and wastewater exposure. Effectively predicting and monitoring these events is crucial in order to maintain global health. These phenomena are incredibly complex with many factors to consider but AI/ML can offer a pathway to effectively predicting floods and monitoring their effects (28).

On the other hand, given that IAVs persist in cold temperature water, soil, and ice, climate warming in Arctic breeding areas may cause decreases in abiotic virus survival, resulting in decreased transmission, infection, and global dispersal [33]. ;; Stopover and breeding locations in Arctic regions, where migratory flyways often overlap, have also been described as incursion points for the movement of IAVs between hemispheres","Complex change","","","","","","","","Complex change","","","","CAN <-> USA, OTHER - described in above short answer question, specify directionality","","Stopover and breeding locations in Arctic regions, where migratory flyways often overlap, have also been described as incursion points for the movement of IAVs between hemispheres [4,5,6,10,100]. In the North Atlantic, Iceland was recently characterized as an ecologically significant stopover and breeding site for wild migratory birds, connecting mainland Europe and Northeastern Canada for the westward movement of IAVs into North America [4,5,101]. Breeding ranges in Siberia have been described as source locations of HPAI H5N8 viruses migrating westward in 2014 to Europe, causing sizeable outbreaks in poultry and wild birds that have continued to present [6]. Southeast Asian-origin viruses isolated in north-central United States have been shown to move first through Siberia followed by the Alaskan peninsula as an entry point prior to further southward dispersal in North America [6,102]. Northern Pintails and other long-distance migrants have been implicated in the inter-continental migration of IAVs from Eurasia, transmitting to mallards with whom they share breeding habitat in Alaska, prior to ducks driving transmission to other species throughout North America [63,103]. Interactions between disparate populations of wild birds in Arctic breeding grounds, therefore, drive the dispersal of IAVs along flyways throughout the annual cycle.

These 27 fish species would bring with them 83 species of parasites that do not currently exist in the Great Lakes, opening the door for epizootic outbreaks of pathogens in immunologically naïve native fishes (Marcogliese 2001). ;; There is speculation that the recent establishment of 2 species of tropical dragonflies in Florida represents a natural invasion from Cuba and the Bahamas that is related to climate change (Paulson 2001). ;; It is estimated that climate-related range expansion by smallmouth bass in Canada may lead to the loss of over 25,000 populations of minnow species (Cyprinidae) in Ontario (Jackson & Mandrak 2002).;; Establishment of tropical species within the coterminous United States has generally been limited to southern states, but releases of tropical species into open waterways have been recorded throughout North America (Fuller et al. 1999). For example, piranha (Pygocentrus or Serrasalmus) have been recorded in 22 states, and although no populations have become established, areas where overwinter survival is possible may increase with climate warming (Fig. 4). ;; For freshwater fishes changes in the frequency and magnitude of ephemeral conditions may favor species with opportunistic life-history strategies (Olden et al. 2006).

Climate warming may, in fact, eliminate cold winter temperatures as a filter that prevents the butterfly peacock bass from expanding its range in the southern United States.;; Climate change may cause shifts in water development policies that would be detrimental to native biodiversity. Reservoir and canal construction were viewed as a sign of progress during European settlement of North America. In the last few decades, however, the attention has shifted to the negative aspects of reservoirs, and dam removal is now viewed as a sign of ecologically forward thinking. Nevertheless, the pendulum may shift again as policy makers view increased water storage as a necessary option for dealing with water shortages caused by human population growth and exacerbated by climate change (Limerick 2003). Although large reservoirs are rarely constructed in North America now, the area of the United States covered by impoundments continues to increase by about 1% per year, mainly due to construction of small impoundments (Downing et al. 2006). Reservoirs may be promoted as beneficial because they provide water for domestic use and habitat for aquatic organisms. But reservoirs are typically dominated by non-native species, especially fishes stocked for sport fishing (Havel et al. 2005). Construction of new reservoirs or canals will not bode well for conservation of native biodiversity in stream ecosystems under a changing climate.;; here could be an increase in the frequency of escapes from aquaculture and tropical fish farm facilities when rearing ponds overflow during flood events ;; Reservoirs provide recreational opportunities that attract humans from far away; thus, they represent potential hot spots for species invasions","","No direction mentioned","Decrease","","","","","human disease","","","Yes","The U.S. and Canadian governments have implemented an aggressive sea lamprey control program, including the construction of low-head dams to block the upstream spawning migrations of sea lampreys. ;; The primary method used to reduce the spread of non-native species via ballast-water discharge is open-ocean ballast-water exchange. ;; An electrified fish barrier also has been constructed on the Chicago Sanitary and Shipping Canal (Stokstad 2003) to prevent the movement of non-native fish such as bighead carp from the Mississippi River basin into the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, where they could have severe impacts on recreational and commercial fisheries.","No","","","","Lots of details in here; figure 1 is great",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,1,70

Arctic eelgrass meadows may not sequester and store as much carbon as seagrass meadows elsewhere (Marbà et al., 2018), but large carbon stocks may accumulate over time, which will require conservation measures to maintain organic carbon sequestration. Macrophyte beds are also important sources of production for coastal food webs, as well as habitat for numerous species. For example, exported kelp carbon plays an important role in supporting Arctic benthic food webs (Petrowski et al., 2016; Vilas et al., 2020). High macrophyte productivity over the long Arctic summer days also raise locally the pH, thereby potentially providing refugia from ocean acidification to vulnerable calcifiers (Krause-Jensen et al., 2016). Moreover, expansive eelgrass meadows, such as those in Alaska with biomasses of up to 1.5 kg dw m–2 (McRoy, 1970) are important feeding areas for migratory water birds. Arctic eelgrass meadows and macroalgal forests also provide important habitat for fish (Dean et al., 2000), such as the role of eelgrass meadows and kelp forests as nurseries for juvenile cod (Gotceitas et al., 1995; Dean et al., 2000) and other fish species (Brand and Fisher, 2016), and as habitat used by schools of adult saith and pollack (Norderhaug et al., 2020).","","No direction mentioned","","","","","","","","Climate change is causing algal communities to expand their ranges northward throughout the arctic, crossing multiple jurisdictions ","No","","No","Inuit","Some species of brown macroalgae are also common food items used by Inuit communities (e.g., Fucus sp., Alaria esculenta, Saccharina longicruris) (Ainana and Zagrebin, 2014; Rapinski et al., 2018).
